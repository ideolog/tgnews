      <h1>Canelo vs. Kovalev official purses: Canelo Alvarez $35 million, Sergey Kovalev $3 million</h1>

      <p>The fighter purses are out for Saturday’s big boxing card in Las Vegas, where Canelo Alvarez (52-1-2, 35 KOs) will challenge for the WBO light heavyweight title against reigning champion Sergey Kovalev (34-3-1, 29 KOs), and unsurprisingly there’s a giant payday coming for Canelo.</p>

KOVALEV ON DAZN</a></b> Mexican boxing superstar Canelo Alvarez goes up two weight classes to challenge WBO champion Sergey Kovalev for his light heavyweight title. Catch all the action on DAZN! <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1516590&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dazn.com%2Fen-US%2Faccount%2Fsignup%2FDN360zGCGBio&amp;referrer=sbnation.com">Subscribe now!</a></aside>
      <p>Thanks to his deal with DAZN, Canelo’s official guarantee is $35 million, and that’s not even including subscription-driven incentives in his contract, or the money he makes from Mexican TV. Kovalev’s guarantee is a decidedly modest $3 million, but he’s reportedly making much more than that. The Athletic reported that Kovalev’s full sum is $12 million, although a cut of that will go <a href="https://theathletic.com/1192711/2019/09/07/how-canelo-alvarez-vs-sergey-kovalev-came-together/">to his co-promoters Main Events and Top Rank</a>. It’s a career-high salary for Kovalev, who is just two months removed from his KO win over Anthony Yarde in Russia.</p>
      <p>The rest of this card... it’s not good and the purses reflect as such. It’s a showcase of prospects and then there’s an interim women’s boxing title bout. in Only 21-year-old prospect Ryan Garcia is making six figures, and that’s obviously a power play win for him given he was at odds with Golden Boy earlier this year. Garcia is getting $250,000 for his non-title bout against Romero Duno. He’s definitely one of the higher paid non-champion boxers in his age bracket. For Seniesa Estrada and Marlen Esparza, they each get $50,000 for their interim WBA flyweight title affair.</p>
