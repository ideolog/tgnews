      <p>Rather than answer the question at the center of the House’s impeachment inquiry, Rep. Don Young (R-AK)… nuzzled a videographer’s camera.</p>
      <p>“There you go,” the congressman commented to the videographer, smiling.</p>
      <p>Until that point, asked several times whether it’s appropriate for the President to ask a foreign government to interfere in American elections, Young just kept walking.</p>
      <p>Maybe this is technically considered a “headbutt.” We report, you decide:</p>

      <p>Young has a bit of a reputation for this kind of thing. Earlier this year, the congressman <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/reporter-rep-don-young-apologized-for-shoving-me">shoved Politico’s Melanie Zanona.</a> He “told me to get out of his way ‘damnit’ as I was trying to interview another lawmaker,” Zanona recalled.</p>
      <p>And few years ago, Young grabbed a congressional staffer’s arm <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/don-young-apologizes-staffer-confrontation">on video</a>. Then there’s the near folkloric tale of him holding a knife — the blade was closed — to the throat of then-House Speaker John Boehner. (Young tells the story <a href="https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-nwcsj-8cd7f7">here at 10:18</a>.)</p>
