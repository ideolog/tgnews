      <p>Apple’s new streaming service, <a href="https://tv.apple.com/?ign-itscg=MC_20000&amp;ign-itsct=atvp_brand_omd">Apple TV Plus</a>, launches today, Nov. 1. The new service, which enters the contentious streaming wars less than two weeks before Disney Plus, boasts an <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/3/25/18277261/apple-tv-plus-streaming-shows-movies">impressive slate of original programming</a> from Hollywood titans like Steven Spielberg and Oprah. It costs $4.99 per month, though new Apple devices come with a free 12-month trial.</p>

      <p>Apple TV Plus is, of course, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/3/25/18280966/apple-tv-plus-streaming-devices-apple-video-2019">available on most Apple devices, as well as any device with an Apple TV app</a>. If you’re looking for the full 4K experience, though, AT&amp;T is offering <a href="https://fave.co/2oBy8bQ">an excellent deal</a> on Apple’s 4K streaming device, appropriately named Apple TV 4K. The 32 GB model is on sale for $90, which is half off retail price. That’s the lowest price we’ve seen on the device, which our friends at The Verge called <a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2018/11/30/18118550/best-streaming-video-player-4k-tv-roku-apple-amazon">“the most polished experience of any set-top box on the market.”</a></p>
      <p>AT&amp;T didn’t specify how long this deal will be live, only that <a href="https://fave.co/2oBy8bQ">it’s available “while supplies last.”</a> There’s also a limit of four per customer. If you’re starting to stock up on holiday gifts, this is a great opportunity to snag a couple of top-tier streaming devices on the cheap.</p>
      <p><b>Update:</b> Sadly, this deal sold out within two hours. If you’re still in the market for a 4K streaming device, though, a <a href="https://amzn.to/2WyDWzg">4K Amazon Fire TV Stick</a> is on sale for $39.99. (Apple TV is available on Amazon streaming devices.)</p>
