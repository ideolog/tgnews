      <p>"<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/tv">Full House</a>" actress <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/lori-loughlin">Lori Loughlin</a> and her husband, fashion designer <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/mossimo-giannulli">Mossimo Giannulli</a>, will plead not guilty to the latest round of charges brought against them in the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/college-admissions-scandal">college admissions scandal</a>.</p>
      <p>Fox News obtained court documents filed by the couple Friday stating that they plan to plead not guilty to charges of conspiracy to commit federal program bribery. The couple also waived their right to appear at a Nov. 20 arraignment.</p>
      <p>Giannulli, 56, and Loughlin, 55, are accused of arranging a total collective payment of $500,000 to scam mastermind <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/who-is-william-rick-singer-college-admissions-cheating-scandals-alleged-ringleader">William “Rick” Singer</a> to get their daughters recruited to USC as athletes on the crew team, despite never rowing in the sport.</p>

      <p>Last week, the Justice Department announced that the couple, along with nine other parents, were <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/lori-loughlin-mossimo-giannulli-new-charges-college-admissions-scandal">indicted on federal charges related to bribery</a>. A grand jury in Boston indicted the parents on charges of trying to bribe officials at an organization that receives at least $10,000 in federal funding. In this case, they're accused of paying to get their children admitted to the University of Southern California.</p>
