      <h1>Reality star Suzi Taylor allegedly attempted to extort Tinder date, had him assaulted: report</h1>

      <p>A <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/genres/reality">reality TV</a> star in Australia is accused of trying to extort her Tinder date — and then assaulting him with another man when he refused to pay, according to a new report.</p>
      <p>Suzi Taylor, who starred on the hit home renovation show “The Block,” allegedly lured the 33-year-old victim, whom she met through the dating app, to a home in Brisbane just after midnight Wednesday, <a href="https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity-life/exblock-contestant-suzi-taylor-charged-with-robbing-assaulting-tinder-date/news-story/494e99930f72ea467f0dca4a939957c9">News.com.au reported</a>.</p>
      <p>She then demanded money from him — but when he refused to comply, Taylor’s alleged accomplice, Ali Ebrahimi, entered the room and assaulted the man, police said in a statement.</p>
