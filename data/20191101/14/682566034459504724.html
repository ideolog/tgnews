      <h1>7 days, 2 Soweto derbies: Ernst v Rhulani</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T14:12:00+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 14:12</time> by <a rel="author">Tashreeq Vardien - Sport24</a></address>
      <p>Cape Town - Three months into the domestic season and soccer fans are relishing the prospect of two <b>Soweto derbies</b> over the next seven days.</p>
      <p>The first encounter will see <b>Kaizer Chiefs </b>'host' arch-rivals Orlando Pirates at the Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban in their <b>Telkom Knockout quarter-final </b>on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Saturday will be a massive sporting day for South Africa when the <b>Springboks</b> target a third World Cup triumph against <b>England </b>in Japan prior to kick-off in the soccer.</p>
      <p>The rugby kicks off at <b>11:00 </b>(SA time) while the soccer starts at <b>15:00.</b></p>
      <p>Amakhosi have been coasting in the Absa Premiership - 22 points from 9 games - which sees Ernst Middendorp's side lead the chasing pack in the <a href="https://www.sport24.co.za/Soccer/PSL/Logs">log standings</a>.</p>
      <p>Their recent win against champions Mamelodi Sundowns has firmly put the Glamour Boys in the driving seat for a <a href="https://www.sport24.co.za/Columnists/TashreeqVardien/comment-ernsts-chiefs-trotting-on-20191028">first league crown since the 2014/15 campaign</a>.</p>
      <p>However, the Brazilians and fellow league challengers Bidvest Wits will not go down without a fight as the season progresses.</p>
      <p>In eighth position on the table, Rhulani Mokwena's Buccaneers have been struggling since the shock departure of <a href="https://www.sport24.co.za/Soccer/PSL/orlando-pirates-coach-quits-20190817">head coach Milutin Sredojevic to Zamalek in August</a> - two weeks after the start of the season.</p>
      <p>The 32-year-old Mokwena has been entrusted by owner Irvin Khoza as the Sea Robbers' interim coach, and quite frankly, the level of performance has dropped under his watchful eye.</p>
      <p>A lucky midweek <a href="https://www.sport24.co.za/Soccer/PSL/pirates-edge-highlands-park-thanks-to-dubious-offside-decision-20191029">1-0 win against an in-form Highlands Park</a>, courtesy of poor officiating, will have the Buccaneers eager to prove their worth on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Pirates have only 12 points from 9 matches - 10 behind leaders Chiefs.</p>
      <p>The second fixture (Saturday, November 9) will be an Absa Premiership clash at the FNB Stadium where tickets are fast approaching being sold out.</p>
