      <p>Felicity Jones feared she had broken her back in a hot air balloon crash while filming her latest movie.</p>
      <p>The Rogue One actress, 36, and co-star Eddie Redmayne, 37, had an accident while filming The Aeronauts.</p>
      <p>Jones, who plays an obsessive air balloon pilot in the movie, told Porter: “My eye missed the metal corner of this wooden chest, by about five centimetres.</p>
      <p>“I was wearing a corset as well, to add insult to injury.</p>

      <p>“At that moment I thought I might actually have broken my back, as I couldn’t move,” she told the digital magazine.</p>
      <p>And she said of Redmayne: “Eddie and I (were) holding hands and hoping for the best as we hit the ground at an incredible velocity.”</p>
      <p>Redmayne has previously spoken about the incident, saying: “The crash was intense, I’m not going to lie.</p>
      <p>“We came thundering down and crashed into these trees and then the basket crunched to the ground and we were flung back.</p>
      <p>“In the basket in the film is a campaign chest, a big piece of furniture, and Felicity’s head smacked against the piece of furniture and there was this ominous silence.</p>
      <p>“But fortunately she lived to tell the tale.”</p>
      <p>The full article is in Porter on iPhone, iPad and Android.</p>
