      <h1>Liverpool told to pursue N'Golo Kante transfer as Chelsea man is final piece of "jigsaw"</h1>
      <h2>The Blues midfielder scored against Jurgen Klopp's side in the clash at Stamford Bridge earlier this season</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T14:51:26+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 14:51</time> by <a rel="author">Darren Wells, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/darren-wells/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> have been urged to pursue <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> star N'Golo Kante to add the final piece to the "jigsaw".</p>
      <p>The Blues midfielder is widely regarded as one of the best in the world in his position.</p>
      <p>He even got on the scoresheet against the Reds earlier this season, finding the top corner from the edge of the box in his sides 2-1 defeat at Stamford Bridge.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/ngolo-kante">Kante</a> cut inside Liverpool's Fabinho to score, and whilst they play in similar roles, Reds legend Jason McAteer believes they'd make a formidable pairing.</p>
      <p>“The role of the holding midfielder has developed in modern times and Liverpool boast one of the best in the business in Fabinho," McAteer told the <a href="https://www.racingpost.com/sport/">Racing Post</a> .</p>

      <p>"He took time to settle at Anfield but was taken out of the team and given time on the training ground and has now slotted back in seamlessly.</p>
      <p>"He just gets it, gives it and doesn’t do anything flamboyant, though it took him a while to learn the role.</p>
      <p>"And that’s exactly what he’s doing. His awareness of danger is fantastic.</p>
      <p>"He and N'Golo Kante at Chelsea are the two best players in the Premier League playing that role - Kante is definitely one of the final pieces in Jurgen Klopp’s jigsaw.”</p>

      <p>Liverpool are inundated with options in midfield, with the likes of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Naby Keita, Adam Lallana and Xherdan Shaqiri all strugging for regular minutes.</p>
      <p>The situation with Oxlade-Chamberlain is an intriguing one, given he was a key player prior to suffering a serious knee injury.</p>
      <p>He scored in the midweek clash against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> , which followed two goals in the Champions League win away at Genk the week prior.</p>
      <p>But Klopp admitted he still wants more from his player before he gives him a more starring role.</p>
      <p>"He has scored, nice, both at Genk, a real stunner on Wednesday, a lot of outstanding moments, but other moments he is not involved," Klopp said.</p>
      <p>"We always have to try to reach perfection. He still needs rhythm but that is no problem. He is a long-term project."</p>
