      <h1>Pixel 4 root users can now enable Motion Sense in restricted countries</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T14:00:29+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 14:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/author/david-oh/" target="_blank">David Oh</a></address>
      <p>The Pixel 4 is the first phone to ship with Soli-powered Motion Sense gestures, but the Soli radar chip shuts off when the <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/10/15/pixel-4s-motion-sense-will-disable-itself-in-unsupported-regions/">phone is used in restricted countries</a>. The reasoning is quite simple â€” radar technology can potentially interfere with navigation systems and military equipment, so Soli needs explicit approval from governments. Unfortunately, the number of countries where Motion Sense works out-of-the-box is <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-pixel-4-motion-sense-list-countries-supported-apps/">quite small</a>. We suspected it was only a matter of time before someone figured out a way to bypass the regional restriction, and today's the day.</p>
      <p>Motion Sense uses radar to identify and interpret hand gestures, allowing you to <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/10/20/pixel-4-motion-sense-demo-tips/">control some select apps and features</a>. Although it's little more than a <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/10/20/pixel-4-motion-sense-demo-tips/">party trick</a> right now, it has the potential to branch out into more areas such as <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/10/17/headed-south-is-a-motion-sense-game-for-pixel-4-from-monument-valleys-creators-apk-download/">gaming</a> with developer support. Of course, Google <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/10/29/google-has-no-immediate-plans-to-open-motion-sense-api-to-third-party-devs/">has to let developers access it first</a>. That didn't stop a Redditor from poking around in the Motion Sense APK, eventually discovering a root-only method to enable the feature regardless of location. After enabling "Developer options" on the phone, simply connect it to a PC with ADB and enter one of the following commands.</p>
      <p>adb shell setprop pixel.oslo.allowed_override true</p>
      <p>or</p>
      <p>adb shell "setprop persist.pixel.oslo.allowed_override true; setprop ctl.restart zygote"</p>
      <p>Alternatively, you can arrive at the same result by using Magisk and an <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/pixel-4-xl/themes/success-enable-soli-china-t3994917">Xposed module called <i>EnableSoliOnPixel4</i></a>. Several XDA Forums users have confirmed Motion Sense is working in restricted countries like China and Mexico with the module.</p>
      <p>Just because you <i>can</i> do this doesn't mean you should. Using Soli in unapproved countries probably runs afoul of local laws, and you need to be extra security-conscious with a rooted phone in the first place.</p>
