      <p>You know what I love? A streaming service with as few things to watch as possible. Oh, and what’s that flying through my window at midnight? It’s Apple TV+!</p>
      <p>While Apple’s new streaming service might seem like a bargain at $4.99 a month (technically the cheapest of all its competitors in this field), it’s actually, at the moment at least, the most expensive.</p>
      <p>Why? Because Apple’s starting off with a catalogue of just eight TV shows and one documentary. Let me say that again. Apple TV+ will launch with nine watchable things. You can literally count the content on two hands.</p>
      <p>This means you’re paying $0.55 a month per show or movie.</p>
      <p>By way of comparison, Netflix offers a US catalogue of 1,326 TV shows and 4,339 movies for $12.99 per month. That means you’re paying just $0.0023 per piece of content. </p>
      <p>In other words, Netflix gives you 242 times more value than Apple TV+.</p>
      <p>For the sake of fairness, we should also compare the amount of original content across the two platforms, as Apple is launching solely with its own shows — something that seems to be its ongoing strategy.</p>
      <p>Now, Netflix has approximately 600 originals in its catalogue. Apple TV+, again, has nine. Even taking this into account, Apple TV+ is 26 times more expensive than Netflix.</p>
      <p>Cool. Cool cool cool. Cool.</p>
      <p>If Apple truly wants to compete price-wise, it should start off with a monthly fee of — no kidding — two cents.</p>
      <p>But that would look cheap. So, how about the company offers a free subscription for, say, six months? Or until its catalogue reaches an acceptable size. </p>
      <p>Still, it’s no surprise that Apple is charging people immediately, especially with its shifting focus from hardware to services. I’ll put it this way though: Apple’s going to need more than nine shows to sway spoilt Netflix binge watchers and get them to buy another subscription.</p>
