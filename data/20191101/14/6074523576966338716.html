      <h1>Telegram Releases Test Crypto Wallet Despite SEC Lawsuit</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T14:00:14+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 14:00</time> by <a rel="author">Anna Baydakova</a></address>
      <p>Telegram, the messaging app company turned blockchain startup, has released an early desktop wallet for its “gram” token.</p>
      <p>Now users can download the test app for MacOS, Windows and Linux 64 bit on Telegram’s official <a href="https://wallet.ton.org/">website</a> and get their keys on the TON testnet. The wallet asks users to save 24 seed words and create a password for payments, after which the wallet is ready to receive and send grams.</p>
      <p>“Now you have a wallet only you control – directly, without middlemen or bankers,” the app says to new users.</p>

      <p>Users can also get testnet grams from a special Telegram <a href="https://t.me/test_ton_bot">bot</a>, asking it to send from 5 to 20 tokens. A test transaction took just a minute for this CoinDesk reporter, though the bot warned it could take longer at busy times.</p>

      <p>TON, an ambitious blockchain project by Telegram, which <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/telegram-doubles-amount-raised-in-ico-to-1-7-billion">raised</a> $1.7 billion in a closed token sale last year, had been previously scheduled to launch until October 31. In September, the team <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/telegram-finally-releases-code-for-its-1-7-billion-ton-blockchain">released</a> the code for a full node, a validator node and block explorer, signaling that the project had been on its way to launch.</p>
      <p>In the beginning of October, the project <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/telegram-finally-confirms-its-behind-ton-blockchain">published</a> the terms of use for the wallet app and <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/telegrams-ton-blockchain-is-on-track-for-late-october-launch-date">asked</a> the investors to share their public keys using TON’s key generator — according to the developers community chats groups, the same generator is now built into the app.</p>
      <p>However, the launch was postponed after Telegram was <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/sec-halts-telegrams-1-7-billion-unlawful-token-issuance">sued</a> by the SEC, which deemed grams to be unregistered securities and asked the court to prevent Telegram from delivering tokens to investors. Telegram subsequently got an <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/telegram-token-investors-reject-refund-offer">approval</a> from investors to postpone the launch until April 31, 2020, to win more time time to clear the situation with the SEC.</p>
      <p>The company is going to meet the SEC in court on February 18 and 19, 2020, in New York.</p>
