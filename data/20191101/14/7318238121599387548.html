      <h1>McDonald's sorry after 'Sundae Bloody Sundae' ice cream advert</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T14:50:39+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 14:50</time> by <a rel="author">Cristina Abellan Matamoros</a></address>
      <p>McDonald's has apologised for a Halloween marketing campaign in Portugal that referenced one of the darkest days of the Northern Ireland sectarian conflict.</p>
      <p>The advert ran pictures of its new sundae ice creams with the pun: "Sundae Bloody Sundae".</p>
      <p>Bloody Sunday saw 13 people killed when British soldiers opened fire at a civil rights march in Derry/Londonderry on January 30, 1972.</p>
      <p>The advert, which started circulating on social media, drew a lot of criticism from users, with some calling it "appalling".</p>

      <p>McDonald's said in a statement to Euronews: "When promoting its Halloween Sundae ice cream, McDonaldâ€™s Portugal developed a local market activation for a small number of its restaurants in Portugal.</p>
      <p>"The campaign was intended as a celebration of Halloween, not as an insensitive reference to any historical event or to upset or insult anyone in any way.</p>
      <p>"We sincerely apologise for any offence or distress this may have caused. All promotional material has been removed from restaurants."</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, a former British soldier faced murder charges over the killing of two people at the Bloody Sunday incident.</p>
      <p>The Irish band U2 wrote a political song about the events of that day entitled "Sunday Bloody Sunday".</p>
