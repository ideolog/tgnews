      <p>State solicitor Stephanie Doyle said Mr Keogh has indicated in a signed letter that he did not want to give a victim impact statement, which was his right.</p>
      <p>Mr Keogh was not in court.</p>
      <p>The defence said the facts could be given by prosecuting officer, Garda Jason O’Carroll, and it was not necessary to see the video evidence.</p>
      <p>The court heard McGregor had also apologised and that was accepted by Mr Keogh.</p>
      <p>The judge was furnished with a letter from the victim confirming he did not wish to provide a impact statement.</p>
      <p>However, the prosecution insisted that the court should see the short piece of footage.</p>
