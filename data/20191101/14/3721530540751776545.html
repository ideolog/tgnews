      <p>Fox has composed music for many games and projects in the past, outside of his work on his own game. Early on, Fox composed music for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/comics/2019/4/22/18511121/homestuck-epilogue-upd8-update"><i>Homestuck</i></a><i>, </i>as one of many community composers who helped bring music to the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/comics/2019/10/25/20932301/homestuck-sequel-continuation-2-beyond-canon-andrew-hussie-october-25">popular webcomic</a>. Fox later composed music for the <i>Homestuck </i>video game, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/9/14/16308080/hiveswap-review"><i>Hiveswap</i></a><i> </i>as well.</p>
      <p>This isn’t the first time that Fox has worked with <i>Pok</i>é<i>mon </i>developer Game Freak either. Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/9/4/20850086/little-town-hero-release-date-game-freak-nintendo-direct">Fox composed for the developer’s game, <i>Little Town Hero</i></a>, which was arranged by Pokémon composer Hitomi Sato.</p>
      <p>Fox further explain on Twitter that he <a href="https://twitter.com/tobyfox/status/1190199695961755649?s=20">didn’t work on the games’ title track</a>, but that he was still excited to be involved.</p>
