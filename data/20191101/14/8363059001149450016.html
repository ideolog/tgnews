      <h1>Uber's Temporary TfL Licence Infuriates London's Black-Cab Drivers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T14:30:56+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 14:30</time> by <a rel="author">Gavin Whenman</a></address>
      <p>More details have emerged on the conditions Transport to London attached in September to <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/09/uber-stays-in-london-for-now/">Uber's two-month licence to operate in the capital</a> and black-cab drivers aren't happy. Although to be fair, they won't be happy until we're all paying £10 for the privilege of travelling half a mile.</p>
      <p>The ride-hailing company secured the licence extension in the latest boring twist in the interminable wranglings between Uber and TfL over a permanent permit. The saga first kicked off back in <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2017/09/uber-has-been-banned-from-london/">2017 when TfL dramatically pulled its licence</a> over concerns about the firm's attitude towards passenger safety.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/30/extraordinary-tfl-criticised-over-uber-licence-extension">documents obtained by the Guardian under the Freedom of Information Act</a>, among the new conditions was a requirement Uber's drivers are licensed by TfL and registered with Uber and that the company check its drivers are not using fraudulent documents for their licence or insurance.</p>
      <p>In a letter to TfL, the Licensed Taxi Drivers’ Association, which represents London's black-cab drivers, made the obvious point that Uber should really have been doing this kind of vetting anyway:</p>
      <blockquote>“It is extraordinary that [Uber] needs to be told to undertake appropriate checks to verify that documentation provided by drivers is legitimate and to notify TfL where potentially fraudulent documentation is submitted.”</blockquote>
      <p>An Uber spokesperson claims the company has made “significant changes” to its business since TfL's 2017 decision:</p>
      <blockquote>“This includes launching new safety features for riders, introducing better protections for licensed drivers and we’ve improved our corporate governance and compliance."</blockquote>
      <p>With the two-month licence due to expire towards the end of November, Uber will likely be seeking either another extension or a permanent licence. [<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/30/extraordinary-tfl-criticised-over-uber-licence-extension">Guardian</a>]</p>
