      <p><b>ATTLEBORO, Mass.Â (AP)</b> - A Massachusetts man has been sentenced to up to 10 years in prison for molesting a 5-year-old girl he knew.</p>
      <p>The Sun Chronicle reports that 55-year-old James Hickman was sentenced Thursday in Fall River Superior Court following his conviction earlier this week on charges of indecent assault and battery on a person under 14 and committing unnatural acts on a child under 16.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors say he molested the girl in her Attleboro home in June 2016. He was arrested in Georgia in 2017 based on DNA evidence.</p>
      <p>Hickman's lawyer, Ted Koban, argued for a two-year prison term. His client had denied any wrongdoing.</p>
      <p>Authorities say Hickman faced similar charges in 2003 involving a 9-year-old girl, but the case was eventually dropped by prosecutors because she was not able to testify.</p>
