      <h1>Here Are the 11 New Books You Should Read in November</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T14:41:20+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 14:41</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://time.com/author/annabel-gutterman/" target="_blank">Annabel Gutterman</a></address>
      <p>Events of the past can be painful to look back on — and even more challenging to move forward from. But several of the best books coming out in November tackle troubling histories, both big and small, in fresh and imaginative ways. Carmen Maria Machado’s memoir uses literary tropes to describe damaging power dynamics in a past relationship. Bernadine Evaristo’s Booker Prize winning book moves between 12 fictional narrators to trace the plight of black British women over the decades. And Erika Lee’s latest history puts America’s relationship with xenophobia on full display. Here, the best new books to read in November.</p>
      <h3>The Crying Book, Heather Christle (Nov. 5)</h3>

      <p>Though the title suggests otherwise, poet Heather Christle’s book is about more than crying. As she reflects on the loss of a close friend to suicide and her own battle with depression, Christle asks why and how we cry and what it means, especially for women, to do so. But in <i>The Crying Book</i>, the author’s blend of personal experience and scientific research gives way to broader discussions about motherhood, mental health, grief and art.</p>

      <p>In October, British author Bernadine Evaristo made history when she became the first black woman to <a href="https://time.com/5700393/atwood-evaristo-booker-prize/">receive the Booker prize</a>. She shared the 2019 award with Margaret Atwood. Evaristo’s book <i>Girl, Woman, Other </i>comprises 12 interconnected stories focused on primarily black British women over several decades. Though the characters who populate the novel are radically different — a 10-year-old orphan narrates one chapter, while a feminist playwright voices another — they are linked by Evaristo’s expert commentary on race, womanhood, sexuality and more.</p>

      <p>This highly inventive memoir by 2017 National Book Award finalist Carmen Maria Machado explores the trauma and horror of domestic abuse. Each chapter is designed around a different narrative trope — the unreliable narrator, choose-your-own-adventure and more — to further illustrate the painful years Machado spent in a relationship with a woman she describes as erratic and dangerous. Moving beyond the intricacies of her personal story, Machado incorporates examples from literature, history and pop culture to investigate the dialogue surrounding abuse in same-sex relationships.</p>

      <p>Actor and comedian Jenny Slate’s new book invites readers into the way she thinks about the world around her.

      <p>In the follow-up to her 2017 debut <i>A Kind of Freedom</i>, Margaret Wilkerson Sexton again showcases the impact of racism across generations. <i>The Revisioners </i>opens in 2017 New Orleans with Ava, a biracial single parent who has just moved herself and her son into her white grandmother’s home. Then the story flashes back to nearly a century earlier, when Ava’s great-great-grandmother Josephine, a former slave, has just met her new white neighbors in 1924. As the two characters’ storylines converge, Sexton crafts a haunting portrait of survival, freedom and hope.</p>

      <p>In 1978, author and psychiatrist Samuel Shem introduced readers to the chaotic world inside a fictional hospital in his satirical cult favorite <i>The House of God</i>.

Like its predecessor, Shem’s sequel is darkly funny, but still pokes at bigger present-day issues plaguing the American healthcare system.</p>

      <p>In September 2018, the New York <i>Times </i>ran an opinion piece by an anonymous author that rocked the internet. The op-ed, titled, “I Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration,” sparked conversation across the country — even <a href="https://time.com/5388118/trump-new-york-times-reveal-anonymous-op-ed-writer/">President Trump himself weighed in</a>, calling on the <i>Times </i>to identify the author. Still writing as “Anonymous,” the unnamed senior Trump Administration official is now publishing a book that promises new behind-the-scenes information about the Trump White House.</p>
