      <p>According to the latest reports in England, Pep Guardiola's side is among a number of teams chasing 21-year-old Romania international Florinel Coman.</p>
      <p>The <i>Daily Mail</i> has reported that City have stepped up their chase for the Steaua Bucuresti starlet, who was once likened to Paris Saint-Germain superstar Mbappe by the club's owner Gigi Becali.</p>

      <p>Coman, who operates as a winger or wide forward, was part of the Romania squad that reached the semi-finals of the 2019 UEFA European U21 Championship, and made his senior international debut last month.</p>
      <p>The Citizens' pursuit of the former Viitorul Constanța star could hit a snag, however, as his contract reportedly carries an €88 million (R1.4 billion) release clause, which the club are unlikely to be willing to meet. </p>
