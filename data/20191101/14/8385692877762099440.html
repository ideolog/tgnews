      <p>This is also going to make for a really great stocking stuffer, or a secret Santa present that's not going to cost a ton.</p>
      <p>The Fire TV Stick 4K is the high-end model of the Fire TV line. This is because it supports 4K and HDR content, giving you a really great picture. It still runs on Fire TV OS, which offers a ton of great apps and other features.</p>
