      <h1>AT&amp;T was selling the Apple TV 4K for just $90, but it’s now sold out</h1>
      <h2>It comes with a free one-year Apple TV Plus subscription</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T14:59:00+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 14:59</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/cameron-faulkner" target="_blank">Cameron Faulkner</a></address>
      <p><b>Update 1:29PM ET, November 1st</b>: AT&amp;T appears to have sold out of the Apple TV 4K for this deal. <i>The Verge</i> has contacted AT&amp;T to see if more units will be made available at this price.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/black-friday">Black Friday</a> is still a few weeks away, but AT&amp;T has dropped a bombshell of a deal today on the Apple TV 4K (32GB). Usually $179, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.att.com%2Fbuy%2Faccessories%2Fstreaming-tv%2Fapple-tv-4k-32gb-black.html%23&amp;referrer=theverge.com">you can get one of these set-top boxes for just $90 right now</a>.</p>
      <p>This deal is well-timed, as the Apple TV Plus streaming service launched today, and you’ll get a complimentary one-year subscription to it with this purchase. But there are other reasons why you might want to invest in Apple’s streaming device. You can play Apple Arcade titles, like <i>Sayonara Wild Hearts </i>and <i>What The Golf</i> to name a few, on your TV. And with the latest free update to tvOS 13, the Apple TV is compatible with the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/1/20893268/ios-13-ipados-tvos-android-pair-ps4-xbox-one-controller-gaming-apple-arcade-google-play-pass">Xbox wireless controller and DualShock 4</a>. Also, Disney+ will be launching in a few weeks, and the Apple TV is one of the places that you’ll be able to watch an endless amount of Disney content.</p>
      <p>I don’t expect this deal to stick around for too long. So if you, or someone who you know, has been looking for some big savings on the Apple TV 4K, you may want to pick up one of these from AT&amp;T’s sale.</p>
