      <p>WASHINGTON, Nov 1 — The US labour market took a punch in October from an extended strike at General Motors but the economy continued to add jobs at a solid pace, according to official data released today.</p>
      <p>The steady hiring showed demand for workers remained resilient despite President Donald Trump’s protracted trade war with China, that has chilled investment and slowed the economy.</p>
      <p>Employers added 128,000 net new jobs, the Labor Department reported in the closely-watched monthly employment report, defying many economists who expected a sharp slowdown.</p>
      <p>And gains in the prior months were revised up sharply and wages continued to climb, making the jobs picture even stronger.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the jobless rate rose a notch to a still-low 3.6 per cent, as expected. The 3.5 per cent unemployment rate in September was the lowest since 1969.</p>
      <p>Nearly 50,000 GM workers were called back to work this week following a 40-day strike, but the stoppage put a deep dent in October’s auto industry employment levels.</p>
      <p>The ranks of auto workers shrank by more than 41,000, according to the report — the biggest drop in that sector since October 2009, when the American auto giant was at the brink of collapse.</p>
      <p>Without the impact of the GM strike, employment in the US manufacturing sector would have risen in October.</p>
      <p>Hiring was also strong in other sectors, averting the dire outcomes some economists had predicted, as bars, restaurants and financial services companies continued to snap up new workers.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Wages rising</b>
      </p>
      <p>And the gains came despite the fact federal government hiring of temporary workers ahead of the 2020 census ended, removing the temporary boost of prior months.</p>
      <p>Even with the GM strike, employment in August and September were revised up by a combined 95,000, the Labor Department said.</p>
      <p>Overall, job growth has slowed in 2019 to a monthly average of 167,000, compared to 223,000 last year, as the supply of available workers dwindles and skittish companies hold off on adding workers amid concerns about the US-China trade war.</p>
      <p>But low unemployment and steady job growth should continue to support consumer spending, which represents the lion’s share of US economic activity.</p>
      <p>Compared to October of last year, worker pay rose three per cent, meaning year-on-year wage gains have been at or above three per cent for 15 straight months.</p>
      <p>The Federal Reserve this week cut interest rates for the third time in a row, moving to shield the economy from a global slowdown and the effects of the trade wars and other factors slowing the US and global economies.</p>
      <p>But Fed Chairman Jerome Powell signalled Wednesday the central bank likely will hold off on providing any further stimulus to the economy. — AFP</p>
