      <h1>Pep Guardiola agrees with Jurgen Klopp over fixture pile-up</h1>
      <h2>The Liverpool boss claimed players are being burnt out over the amount of games they're having to play</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T14:41:43+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 14:41</time> by <a rel="author">David McDonnell, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/david-mcdonnell/</a></address>
      <p>Pep Guardiola has backed title rival Jurgen Klopp by claiming too many games are wrecking modern players.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> boss Klopp complained at fixture pile-up, with the Reds struggling to find a date for their Carabao Cup quarter-final against Aston Villa.</p>
      <p>Klopp's side are due to travel to Villa on December 17, but cannot keep to that date because they play in Qatar the following day in FIFA's Club World Cup.</p>
      <p>Liverpool face the prospect of having to field two different teams in the games if an alternative date cannot be found for the Carabao Cup tie.</p>
      <p>Klopp said Liverpool could be forced to pull out of the competition, with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> boss Guardiola agreeing with his managerial rival.</p>

      <p>“I completely agree,” said Guardiola. “Less games. Less fixtures, less competitions, more recovery.</p>
      <p>“We play December 27 and 29 in winter. It’s always the debate, in UEFA meetings they talk about it. I’m with Jurgen about it being too much.”</p>
      <p>Guardiola admitted the weight of fixture pile-up meant he was forced to rotate his squad for Tuesday's 3-1 Carabao Cup win over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/southampton-fc">Southampton</a> .</p>

      <p>“I didn’t play Kevin [De Bruyne] Ilkay [Gundogan], David [Silva] - and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> and Liverpool have done the same,” said Guardiola.</p>
      <p>“The players who don’t play regularly play more often [in the Carabao Cup] but it’s too much.”</p>
