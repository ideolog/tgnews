      <h1>General election: When Boris Johnson aide said Tory MPs don't care about the NHS</h1>
      <h2>"I am sad to say the public is basically correct," Dominic Cummings said in 2017</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T14:50:52+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 14:50</time> by <a rel="author">Dan Bloom, https://www.facebook.com/mirrordanbloom</a></address>
      <p>The NHS is shaping up to be one of the main battlegrounds of the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/general-election">general election</a> .</p>
      <p>Voters will go to the polls on December 12, just as the annual winter crisis is expected to snarl up the nation's hospitals.</p>
      <p>And the health service has already played host to bitter spats, with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> denying Jeremy Corbyn's claims he will open it up to US private firms.</p>
      <p>So it's worth reminding ourselves what Boris Johnson's most powerful No10 advisor said about the NHS just two years ago.</p>
      <p>Dominic Cummings gave a speech at a 2017 conference exposing his view of the government he's now tasked to run.</p>
      <p>He said: "What is one of the core problems of the Tory party brand? NHS.</p>

      <p>"People think - and by the way I think most people are right - 'The Tory party is run by people who basically don’t care about people like me'.</p>
      <p>"That is what most people in the country have thought about the Tory party for decades.</p>
      <p>"I know a lot of Tory MPs, and I am sad to say the public is basically correct."</p>
      <p>As the crowd laughed, he continued: "Tory MPs largely do not care about these poorer people. They don’t care about the NHS.</p>
      <p>"And the public kind of has cottoned on to that."</p>
      <p>The video was unearthed earlier this year by The Guardian after Mr Cummings became the PM's most senior advisor in 10 Downing Street.</p>
      <p>A friend of Dominic Cummings <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/boris-johnsons-top-aide-declared-18803713">said back in July:</a> "Dom was clear that he thinks the British public care most about leaving the EU and want more money for the NHS." Downing Street declined to comment at the time.</p>

      <p>While he is not running the election campaign himself, he is a key figure in Boris Johnson's administration as the Tory leader takes Corbyn's criticism about the NHS head-on.</p>
      <p>Boris Johnson dismissed claims the NHS could be exposed to US investment and said on Wednesday: "We will invest massively in that NHS and take it forward."</p>
      <p>Yet <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> members chanted "not for sale! not for sale! not for sale!" the next day as Mr Corbyn accused <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Johnson</a> of stitching up a US trade deal that would cost the NHS more money.</p>
      <p>"Despite his denials, the NHS is up for grabs by US corporations in a one-sided Trump trade sell-out," Labour's leader declared.</p>
      <p>Part of the fears are around US pharmaceutical firms and the prices they could charge the health service for vital drugs.</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn said this week: "The US has called for full market access to our NHS, which would mean prices of some of our most important medicines increasing by up to seven fold."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a> last night denied US firms would demand NHS access as part of a trade deal.</p>
      <p>The US President told LBC: "It’s not for us to have anything to do with your healthcare system. No, we’re just talking about trade."</p>
