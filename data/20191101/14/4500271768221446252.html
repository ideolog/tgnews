      <p>Erdogan mentioned 65 victims, as was earlier reported; the number of deceased, however, went up to 73 by late Thursday.</p>
      <p>About <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1514002">73 people perished</a> in the Liaqatpur city of Rahim Yar Khan district when three carriages of a Tezgam train caught fire on Thursday. According to initial reports, the fire was caused by a cylinder blast that occurred when passengers were preparing breakfast for themselves in a moving train.</p>
      <p>Condolence messages were also sent by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, United States' Acting Assistant Secretary of State Alice G. Wells, the Chinese embassy in Pakistan and former British high commissioner to Pakistan Thomas Drew, among others.</p>
      <p>"Having just returned from visiting Pakistan, we were horrified and deeply saddened to hear about the tragic fire on the Tezgam train near Rahim Yar Khan," a <a href="https://www.royal.uk/message-duke-and-duchess-cambridge-president-pakistan">statement</a> posted by Kensington Palace on behalf of Prince William and Duchess Kate Middleton said. "Our thoughts and prayers are with all the people and families affected by this heart-breaking disaster."</p>
