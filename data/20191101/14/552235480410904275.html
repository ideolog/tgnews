      <h1>Edinburgh-bound Ryanair flight found flying 'near North Pole' in computer blunder</h1>
      <h2>The malfunction pinned the flight from Portugal down thousands of miles away from its location over the Bay of Biscay.</h2>

      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/entertainment/tv-radio/argos-christmas-advert-2019-unveiled-20765344">Christmas</a> almost came early for an Edinburgh-bound flight after computers recorded the aircraft as being near the North Pole when it was actually off the coast of Spain.</p>
      <p>The malfunction pinned the Boeing 737-800 <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/brit-pair-grapple-floor-punch-20752855">Ryanair</a> flight from Porto, Portugal thousands of miles away from its location over the Bay of Biscay.</p>
      <p>This computer error forced the crew into manually flying the aircraft to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> after the pilot was presented with incorrect information on the command system.</p>
      <p>A report by the UK Department for Transport’s Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) exposed the error made on October 9 last year, on the then five-month-old aircraft.</p>

      <p>The AAIB reported ‘erroneous airspeed and windshear warnings’ as the plane approached Edinburgh Airport. Despite this, the aircraft was landed safely.</p>
      <p>The report said that, ‘the commander’s attitude indicator malfunctioned, affecting numerous aircraft systems, and the aircraft climbed 600ft.’.</p>
      <p>It continued: “The crew followed the actions detailed in the quick reference handbook, but erroneous information continued to be displayed to the pilot in command and other systems were also affected.</p>
      <p>“The aircraft was flown manually to Edinburgh where it landed safely.</p>
      <p>“The investigation found the left IRS suffered a transient fault which had led to an erroneous calculation of position.</p>

      <p>The report added: “During the approach, they encountered erroneous airspeed and windshear warnings, and the autobrake system would not arm.”</p>
      <p>“The landing was uneventful, using manual braking, after which the aircraft taxied to the stand where the passengers disembarked.”</p>
      <p>Boeing said it has has now amended its “quick reference handbook” checklist, by updating guidance for pilots faced with similar circumstances.</p>
