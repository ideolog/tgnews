      <p>Police are investigating the attack at a home in Orlinda, Calif., about 7 miles east of downtown Oakland. A neighbor told authorities the home was rented for the private party through Airbnb. The neighbor said as many as 50 people attended.</p>
      <p>The gunfire injured multiple people, in addition to the four deaths, officials said.</p>
      <p>Orlinda police and the Contra Costa County Sheriff’s Office are investigating the attack, but do not yet have a motive.</p>
      <p>Orlinda was rated by Forbes magazine in 2012 as the second-most friendly town in the United States, and was formerly home to Golden State Warriors superstar Stephen Curry.</p>
      <p>“Orinda is supposed to be like a safe neighborhood. And this is what happened. I guess it is what it is,” the neighbor said.</p>
