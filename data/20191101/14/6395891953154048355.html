      <p><b>PROVIDENCE, R.I.Â (AP)</b> - Rhode Island state health officials say they found flavored e-cigarettes being sold in 16 stores despite a state ban on their sale.</p>
      <p>The state Department of Health says 75 stores across the state have been visited by health inspectors since Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo announced the ban on flavored e-cigarettes in September.</p>
      <p>There are 408 shops in Rhode Island licensed to sell e-cigarettes.</p>
      <p>The Health Department began inspecting them after Raimondo prohibited the sale of any flavored vapes to protect children.</p>
      <p>A department spokesman said Thursday that the first phase of inspections is focused on education rather than punishment, so the stores won't be fined.</p>
      <p>Health officials announced in October that two state residents have been treated for confirmed or probable cases of vaping-related lung illness.</p>
