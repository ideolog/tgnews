      <h1>Coldplay Announce Livestreamed Release Day Concerts In Jordan With Faux Press Conference Featuring Carrie Brownstein &amp; Fred Armisen</h1>

      <p>Back in 2000, when <i>Parachutes</i> and <i>All Hands On The Bad One</i> both dropped, the thought of Sleater-Kinney’s Carrie Brownstein appearing in a “funny” Coldplay promo video would have seemed like wild fantasy. Two decades later, it barely registers as weird, which is weird. Time is way too bizarre to be a flat circle.</p>
      <p>Coldplay are releasing <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2062609/coldplay-orphans-arabesque/music/">their new double album <i>Everyday Life</i></a> three weeks from today, on 11/22. This being Coldplay, there will be fanfare. The band just announced they will perform the album for the first time in a pair of release-day concerts livestreamed from Amman, Jordan. They’ll perform the first disc, <i>Sunrise</i>, at 4AM GMT, which lines up nicely for an 11PM EST performance just an hour before the album is released in the US. They’ll perform the second disc, <i>Sunset</i>, at 2pm GMT, aka 9AM EST. So: <i>Sunrise</i> will debut at sunrise, and <i>Sunset</i> will debut at sunset. But in the US, due to Earth’s rotation and geography and such, <i>Sunrise</i> will be after dark and <i>Sunset</i> will be in the morning. Got all that?</p>
      <p>This will be Coldplay’s first performances in Jordan. In a press release, Chris Martin said, “These two broadcasts have been our dream since we first started work on this album. It’s a bit impossible and a bit scary, like all the best dreams. YouTube is the perfect home for it.” Also on YouTube is a faux press conference announcing the livestreamed Jordan shows. Brownstein stars as a journalist alongside her <i>Portlandia</i> costar Fred Armisen. Both of them end up playing multiple characters, as circumstances become increasingly absurd.</p>
