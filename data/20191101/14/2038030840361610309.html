      <p>Cape Town – In a <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/billie-joe-armstrong-billie-eilish-musicians-on-musicians-903872/"><b>Rolling Stone interview</b></a> with Billie Joe Armstrong, pop star Billie Eilish says she almost walked away from her successful music career after having a bad time on the road.</p>
      <p>In the relaxed chat with the Green Day frontman, who is a big fan of hers, Billie explained that while she loves performing for her fans it was the time away from home and other factors that made the experience less enjoyable. </p>
      <p>In the interview she said: "I don’t mean the shows. The shows are always my favourite part. But it was just traveling and being alone all the time, on a cold bus in Europe, horrible food, and when you come back, everyone’s kind of moved on from you. This last tour I went on was the first I’ve ever enjoyed. I feel like I have this amazing thing that now I actually see."</p>
