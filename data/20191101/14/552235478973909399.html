      <p>Animal remains which washed up on a Scottish beach have left residents puzzled.</p>
      <p>The bones, which look like a mixture between a <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/pets">cat</a> and reptile, were found on the shoreline of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/aberdeen">Aberdeen</a> beach.</p>
      <p>A picture of the remains was posted on community page Fubar News after a local made the mysterious discovery.</p>
      <p>But speculation is rife as to what the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/animals">creature</a> could be. The animal has a reptile like face, the ribs are exposed, a long bony tail and claws.</p>
      <p>The post on Fubar News reads: "Found on Aberdeen Beach today. Very strange, can anyone shed some light on what we saw?"</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>Attracting over 600 comments many residents have mixed opinions on the creature, with some believing it is a cat and others a chameleon or bearded dragon.</p>
      <p>One said: "I'm gonna say chameleon as its skull is very similar an its feet as well."</p>
      <p>Others think it is a sea otter or badger, or a mysterious Halloween themed fake prank.</p>
      <p>Another added: "I'm going with "FAKE" on this one...Bearded Dragon/Charmeleon head, Charmeleon tail/back feet.</p>
      <p>"Someone broke some legs off of a crab and stuck them in the abdomen.</p>
      <p>"It's a wax or latex creature, or a couple real creatures blended together and a little Photoshop."</p>
