      <h1>Warren unveils Medicare-for-all payment plan without middle class taxes</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T14:09:00+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 14:09</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://theweek.com/" target="_blank">Kathryn Krawczyk</a></address>
      <p>Here's how Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) will pay for that.</p>
      <p>Warren has <a href="https://theweek.com/articles/871966/pete-buttigiegs-disingenuous-attack-medicareforall">faced criticism</a> in recent weeks after refusing to concede that middle class taxes will rise to pay for her Medicare-for-all plan and not spelling out how she'd pay for it without them. But on Friday, Warren did just that, <a href="https://elizabethwarren.com/plans/paying-for-m4a?source=soc-WB-ew-tw-rollout-20191101">proposing a $20.5 trillion tax package</a> that would specifically target America's wealthiest people and companies to pay for the assumed $34 trillion Medicare-for-all.</p>
      <p>To start, Warren proposes cracking down on tax avoidance to lower its rate from 15 percent to 10 percent. If her planned investment in IRS enforcement works out, it could bring in $2.3 trillion. She then would implement a financial transactions tax of .1 percent on every stock, bond, or derivatives transaction to raise $800 billion. A 35 percent minimum tax on foreign earnings brings in $2.9 trillion, while an increase on Warren's earlier wealth tax on billionaires earns $1 trillion. A few trillion here and a few trillion there more, and Warren gets to the number she needs, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/11/1/20942587/elizabeth-warrens-plan-to-pay-for-medicare-for-all-without-raising-middle-class-taxes-explained"><i>Vox</i> explains</a>.</p>
      <p>Of course, with a Republican Senate, passing all these taxes won't be easy. But <a href="https://twitter.com/BenjySarlin/status/1190253094065594368">NBC News' Benjy Sarlin still calls</a> Warren's proposal an "amazing power move" in which she didn't "concede any general election talking points on taxes" and now has a "detailed plan to wave at."</p>
      <p>The proposal also includes plans for lowering prescription drug and health procedure costs to reduce the demand on health insurance in the first place.
