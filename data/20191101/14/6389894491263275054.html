      <h1>World Vegan day: Is the rise of the flexitarian leading to a vegan revolution?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T14:35:12+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 14:35</time> by <a rel="author">Stefan Boscia</a></address>
      <p>While today may be World Vegan Day, there are still precious few people in the UK who choose to live off all-plant diets.</p>
      <p>Figures from Yougov this year show that just one per cent of Britons identify as vegan and 73 per cent identify as meat eaters.</p>

      <p>However, the stats also uncovered a revealing trend – the rise of the flexitarian.</p>
      <p>Ah yes, the flexitarian – that fellow at the barbecue slyly inserting his environmental and animal rights concerns into a conversation with the auspiciously progressive girl across the table.</p>
      <p>The choice to eat less meat, but still savagely gnaw on a kebab at the end of a long night out in Bethnal Green.</p>
      <p>The appeal is obvious.</p>
      <p>Yougov found that 14 per cent of people now identify as a flexitarian, which the polling company describes as: “A mixed diet, mainly vegetarian and eat meat occasionally.”</p>
      <p>The number of these dietary hybrids rises to 19 per cent in the capital – shock horror – along with the 4 per cent of vegan and 6 per cent vegetarian Londoners.</p>
      <p>Could this be a sign of a growing willingness and intention for people to move away from meat-based diets and embrace a vegan lifestyle?</p>
      <p>The Vegan Society certainly thinks so.</p>
      <p>The group put out a statement today to celebrate World Vegan Day, and the 75th anniversary of Donald Watson starting modern veganism, saying it was “not only a fad”.</p>
      <p>The group said: “The number of vegans will continue to rise exponentially as more people are exposed to ethical, environmental and health messages.”</p>
      <p>However, despite the growing number of vegans, vegetarians and bet hedging flexitarians, the YouGov data suggests the Vegan Society shouldn’t get too ahead of itself.</p>
      <p>Less than half, 42 per cent, of flexitarians said a completely meatless diet is healthier than their current diet, while most said they are happy with their current situation.</p>
      <p>“Flexitarians are occasionally dubbed ‘semi-vegetarians’, indicating that there is a perception of this dietary choice as a half-way house on the way to giving up meat completely,” the report read.</p>
      <p>“The data indicates that this is not necessarily the case. Rather, flexitarians simply want to reduce the amount of meat they consume.”</p>

      <p>Despite the setback, there can be do doubt about the increasing acceptability of vegans – at least in London.</p>
      <p>Nonetheless it won’t be time for the Smithfield market traders to pack up shop any time soon.</p>
