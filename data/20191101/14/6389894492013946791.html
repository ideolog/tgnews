      <h1>Wework hits the brakes on London expansion after Softbank rescue deal</h1>

      <p>Wework’s new owner has put its London expansion plans under review after Softbank stepped in with a massive bailout for the company, it is reported.</p>
      <p>The co-working space giant, which scrapped plans for an initial public offering (IPO) this year, has paused 28 possible deals as Softbank seeks to change tack.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The deals in question range from initial property inspections to advanced talks, sources told Bloomberg. </p>
      <p>Now Softbank has hit the pause button it is unclear how many of these offices will now become Wework buildings.</p>
      <p>One building whose future is now in question is reportedly 5 Churchill Place, the former home of former investment bank titan Bear Stearns in Canary Wharf.</p>
      <p>Wework was in talks to lease one-and-a-half floors of the building, two sources told <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-01/wework-reviews-london-expansion-plans-after-softbank-bailout">Bloomberg</a>.</p>
      <p>“London has always been a fantastic market for us and we continue to see strong demand here,” a Wework spokesperson said.</p>
      <p>“We now have 48 buildings open across the capital and have announced a further 11, including 17 St Helens Place in the City of London which we signed this week.”</p>
      <p>Wework’s relentless expansion in London and Europe <a href="https://www.cityam.com/weworks-european-operational-losses-skyrocket-amid-london-boom/">saw losses skyrocket 900 per cent at its internal division in 2018</a>.</p>
      <p>Wework International sank to an £80m loss as it poured money into 30 UK locations.</p>
      <p>Now, however, parent firm We Company is curbing that pace of expansion as it attempts to bring home a profit to pacify sceptical investors.</p>
      <p>It pulled an IPO in September, then <a href="https://www.cityam.com/wework-chief-executive-reportedly-set-to-step-down-following-botched-listing/">dethroned its colourful founder, Adam Neumann, handing control to two co-CEOs</a>.</p>
      <p>Neumann stepped down from the board as part of the Softbank deal, <a href="https://www.cityam.com/softbank-to-take-control-of-wework/">which netted him $1.7bn (£1.3bn)</a>. He stands accused of gender discrimination and of smoking cannabis in front of a pregnant member of staff.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Fitting out Wework’s plush offices – and the subsequent marketing of them to possible tenants – are major factors behind Wework’s $2.9bn losses.</p>
      <p>Under Neumann, the company was losing roughly $2 for every $1 in revenue.</p>
