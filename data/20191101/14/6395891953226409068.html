      <p><b>NEW YORKÂ (AP)</b> - Exxon Mobil's profits fell dramatically in the third quarter as the company was hurt by lower prices for crude oil and natural gas.</p>
      <p>The Texas oil giant reported $3.17 billion in profits in the third quarter Friday, down 49% from the same time last year.</p>
      <p>Total revenue was $65.05 billion, down 15% from the same time last year.</p>
      <p>Oil prices have suffered due to a prolonged trade war between the U.S. and China, which has raised concerns about a global economic slowdown.</p>
      <p>Natural gas prices have also been low as a glut of the fuel in the U.S. floods the market.</p>
      <p>Despite falling prices, oil production rose 3% to 3.9 million barrels per day, driven primarily by growth in the Permian Basin. Production in the Permian was up 72% compared with the same time last year, the company said.</p>
      <p>"We feel really good about the volume growth that we see out there," said Neil Hansen, vice president of investor relations, on a conference call with investors. "The resource continues to respond very well."</p>
      <p>Outside the U.S., Exxon had five significant deep-water discoveries in Guyana and Cyprus during the quarter.</p>
      <p>The company earned 75 cents per share, down 49% from a year ago, which beat expectations of analysts polled by FactSet, who were expecting 69 cents per share. Its profits were helped by a favorable tax-related item of about $300 million.</p>
      <p>Exxon's share price was up 2% to $68.88 in mid-morning training.</p>
