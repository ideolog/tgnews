      <p><a href="http://overdrive.in/cars/bentley/mulsanne-m22/">Bentley Mulsanne</a> Extended Wheel Base has been delivered in Bangalore, Karnataka. The limo worth Rs 10 cr to V.S. Reddy of British Biologicals. As the name suggests, 'Extended Wheel Base' (EWB) is longer by 250mm in length over the standard Mulsanne and all of the added length benefits the legroom for passengers in the rear.</p>
