      <h1>Apple Seeks Tariff Waivers on iPhone Components, Apple Watch, AirPods and More</h1>

      <p>Apple has asked the United States government to exclude <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods/">AirPods</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a>, iPhone components, and other devices and parts imported from China <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/08/30/apple-products-tariff-september-1/">from the 15 percent tariff</a> that went into effect on September 1, reports <i><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-01/apple-requests-tariff-waivers-on-iphone-parts-watch-and-airpods">Bloomberg</a></i>. <br/><br/>Apple filed for exclusions on 11 products or components on Thursday, which was the first day that companies were able to ask for relief from tariffs.</p>

      <p>During Apple's earnings call earlier this week, Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> confirmed that Apple is already paying tariffs on some of its products. Cook also said that Apple is hopeful the United States and China will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/10/30/apple-iphone-11-sales-good-start/">resolve the trade dispute</a>. <br/><br/>"I don't know every chapter of the book, but I think that will eventually happen," Cook said. "I certainly hope it happens during the quarter, but we'll see about that." <br/><br/>In its request for tariff waivers, Apple said that it has been unable to find a source outside of China able to meet the U.S. demand for products or components in the coming year. <br/><br/>Apple asked for tariff exemption <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/07/23/apple-requests-mac-pro-tariff-exemption/">for Mac Pro components</a> earlier this year, and though Trump initially said Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/07/26/donald-trump-mac-pro-tariffs-tweet/">would not be granted</a> tariff relief, Apple did indeed <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/07/26/donald-trump-mac-pro-tariffs-tweet/">receive exemptions</a> for some of the Chinese made components, and in turn agreed to manufacture the new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/">Mac Pro</a> in Texas. <br/><br/>Note: Due to the political nature of the discussion regarding this topic, the discussion thread is located in our <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forumdisplay.php?f=47">Politics, Religion, Social Issues</a> forum.
