        <i>“Rhulani, My five year old lovely daughter hasn't seen us losing to Naturena faithful neh, and cannot happen anytime soon akere? So please do this for us, We're guaranteed a win...”</i>
      </p>
      <p>These were the pleas of Orlando pirates fan and SL Supporter @@ThizaK ahead of this weekend’s crunch Telkom Knockout semi-final encounter, for his club to overturn their dismal league campaign against their arch-rivals, Kaizer Chiefs.</p>
      <p>Pirates narrowly won their midweek game against Highlands Park, although there were questions surrounding in-form Tshegofatso Mabasa’s winner. Despite this SL Supporter, @mzilikazi.com feels that regardless of their current form, Bucs are always dangerous in the derby.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“Guys let’s not fool ourselves. No matter how bad Pirates are, when they play against Chiefs they perform very well. Check their ball possession tomorrow and attempts at goal.”</i>

      <p>Meanwhile SL Supporter @Nhlaks tsh feels that if his side were to beat Chief, they have to field the team that managed to gain victory over Amakhosi in the Carling Black Label Cup.</p>
      <p> <i>“Hey wena Rhulani, you must win this game. Bring back the Carling black label team and add Mabasa, Makaringe, and Mntambo. Chiefs have not beaten us in a very long time. Come on my boy. Choose the right players and we can beat them.”</i></p>
      <p> For all the talk about their possible turnaround against Chiefs @Mmaxongo feels that Amakhosi have too much firepower this time around.</p>
      <p> <i>“Pirates have good record against Amakhosi in the previous encounters but this time around I don’t see them beating Amakhosi. We have a fearful partnership between Castro, Billiat and Nurkovic. I don’t see their back four dealing with those players in a high tempo game like this. You cannot plan for Middendorp he might surprise you.”</i></p>

        <b>Do you think Pirates can overturn their season if they beat Kaizer Chiefs this weekend?</b>
