      <p>German model and TV personality Heidi Klum seems to have managed to cause quite a stir both offline and online thanks to her dramatic appearance at her 20th Annual Halloween Bash in New York City.</p>
      <p>According to the Daily Mail, the celebrity managed to give the attendees “the shock of a lifetime” as she emerged wearing a costume of a “gory humanoid alien” and accompanied by her husband Tom Kaulitz dressed in a bloody space suit.</p>
      <p>The process of creating and putting on the costume apparently took several hours, with Heidi documenting these efforts on her social media.</p>
