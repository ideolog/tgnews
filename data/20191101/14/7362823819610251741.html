      <h1>Stirewalt: Warren's $52T 'Medicare-for-all' plan is a 'disaster' just like her DNA test release</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T14:10:09+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 14:10</time> by <a rel="author">David Montanaro</a></address>
      <p>Democratic presidential candidate <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/elizabeth-warren">Elizabeth Warren’s</a> long-awaited "Medicare-for-all" <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/warrens-52t-medicare-for-all-plan-revealed-campaign-still-claims-no-middle-class-tax-hikes-needed">funding plan</a> is a "disaster" for her campaign, said Fox News politics editor Chris Stirewalt on Friday, comparing it to the much-criticized release of her Native American <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/warren-releases-dna-analysis-on-native-american-heritage-firing-back-at-trump-attacks">DNA test</a>.</p>
      <p>"What makes this a political nonstarter is that it rests on the idea of taking away people's existing health insurance," he said on <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/media/fox-news-flash">"America's Newsroom,"</a> arguing that most Americans will reject the idea of giving up their employer-based insurance in favor of a government-run system.</p>
      <p>"It's just politically toxic and it's a reflection of a campaign that - much like we saw when she rolled out her Native American DNA test - what a disaster that was. This is Elizabeth Warren doing it again."</p>
      <p>Warren faced mockery last year when <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/warren-releases-dna-analysis-on-native-american-heritage-firing-back-at-trump-attacks">she released</a> a DNA test that showed a trace of Native American heritage, emboldening critics who had long accused her of embellishing on the issue.</p>

      <p>“We don’t need to raise taxes on the middle class by one penny to finance Medicare-or-all,” Sen. Warren, D-Mass., said in her plan — a copy of which was obtained by Fox News in advance of its <a href="https://elizabethwarren.com/plans/paying-for-m4a?source=soc-WB-ew-tw-rollout-20191101">release Friday</a>.</p>
      <p>Some of Warren’s rivals for the nomination are unlikely to buy that claim, after having <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/buttigieg-slams-warren-for-medicare-for-all-plan-with-a-multi-trillion-dollar-hole">repeatedly challenged</a> her assertions that the middle class would not be hit by tax hikes and suggesting she has not been upfront with voters.</p>
      <p>"It won't fly, Orville," Stirewalt responded, noting that Warren has been praised for "having a plan for everything" and being specific about her various policy proposals. But he said her health care plan "undercuts" that plank of her campaign.</p>
      <p>"[The plan] is partly funded through a confiscation of existing wealth that there is not any precedent for inside our constitutional system. This is way over the edge," he said.</p>

      <p>The campaign's detailed Medicare-for-all proposal, however, insists that the costs can be covered by a combination of existing federal and state spending on Medicare and other health care -- as well as a myriad of taxes on employers, financial transactions, the ultra-wealthy and large corporations and some savings elsewhere.</p>
      <p>Those measures are meant to pay for a projected $20.5 trillion in new federal spending. Notably, they include what is essentially a payroll tax increase on employers, something economists generally say can hit workers in the form of reduced wages.</p>
