      <p>NEW YORK, Nov 1 — US oil giants Exxon Mobil and Chevron reported a drop in their third-quarter profits today on lower oil prices, even as increased investment in US shale projects boosted output.</p>
      <p>The companies have pumped heavy investment into the Permian Basin, a shale-rich region in Texas and New Mexico drawing considerable interest due to newer technologies that have made developing unconventional shale resources profitable.</p>
      <p>These efforts enabled Exxon and Chevron, the two biggest US oil companies, to increase overall oil and gas production in the quarter ending September 30.</p>
      <p>But results were dented by a retreat in crude oil prices during the three-month period, as signs of a slowing global economy amplified worries about a glut of supply.</p>
      <p>US oil prices traded in the US$50-US$60 (RM208-RM250) a barrel range for much of the quarter, down about US$15 from the prior year.</p>
      <p>Exxon reported quarterly profits of US$3.2 billion, plunging 49.2 per cent from the year-ago period, as revenues fell 15.1 per cent to US$65 billion.</p>
      <p>Chief Executive Darren Woods said the company’s ramp-up in the Permian was running ahead of schedule, saying “we are making excellent progress on our long-term growth strategy.”</p>
      <p>At Chevron, net profits were US$2.6 billion, which was 36.2 per cent below the same period of 2018. Revenues were US$36.1 billion, a 17.9 per cent decline.</p>
      <p>“Third quarter earnings and cash flow were solid, but down from our very strong results of a year ago,” said Chevron Chief Executive Michael Wirth.</p>
      <p>“Lower crude oil and natural gas prices more than offset a three per cent increase in net oil-equivalent production from last year’s third quarter.”</p>
      <p>Exxon shares rose 0.6 per cent to US$68.00 in pre-market trading, while Chevron’s fell 1.0 per cent to US$115.00. — AFP</p>
