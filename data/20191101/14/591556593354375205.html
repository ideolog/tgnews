      <p>New leaks of what appear to be marketing material for the forthcoming Motorola Razr reveal how the Lenovo-owned brand has played its foldable phone card. <br/><br/>The images were shared by reliable phone leaker and reporter <a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1189977490200158215">Evan Blass via his Twitter account</a>. The account is private so many Twitter users won't be able to see the images. <br/><br/>However, the images indicate that Motorola's designers have stayed faithful to the classic flip phone design, while incorporating foldable screen technology to have a main screen when opened and a secondary screen to interact with when it's folded. A key difference to the old Razr is that in an opened state, it's all screen and lacks a physical keyboard.  <br/><br/>Motorola <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/razrs-return-youre-gonna-flip-teases-motorola-for-its-november-launch/">has scheduled an event on November 13</a> where it promises to reveal a "highly anticipated unveiling of a reinvented icon".  It's expected to release the new take on the original Razr and could cost $1,500. <br/><br/>The brand <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/motorola-razr-classic-flip-phone-returns-this-time-its-a-pricey-foldable/">doesn't want to be too gimmicky</a> and hopes to deliver a phone that's functionally valuable while capitalizing on what the iconic pre-iPhone handset was loved for: it was compact, pocketable and shut with a crisp snap.    </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/motorola-razr-leaked-images-offer-first-look-at-upcoming-foldable-phone/">ZDNet sister site CNET speculates</a> the "chin" or bump at the base of the phone could house a fingerprint sensor. It's not known whether the new Razr will be a 5G phone. Motorola in September said it would launch 5G handsets, <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/motorolas-5g-phones-are-coming-and-they-dont-be-cheap/">but they will be expensive</a>. <br/><br/>Closed, the phone has a basic display that shows the time, date and weather, while also allowing the user to read messages and — possibly, say, with Google Assistant — reply without a keyboard. </p>
      <p>Another image shows that in a closed state, the user-facing camera could be for taking selfies and possibly facial recognition. And in an opened state, the user would have a widescreen display suited to panoramic shots. <br/><br/>The new Razr is expected to run on <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tags/qualcomm/">Qualcomm's</a> Snapdragon 710 processor with up to 6GB of RAM and up to 128GB of storage. </p>
