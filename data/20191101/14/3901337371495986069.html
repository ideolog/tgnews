      <p>Leonardo Castro recently reminded fans exactly what he is made of when he scored an impressive hat-trick against his former side, Mamelodi Sundowns, in the Shell Ultra Helix Cup.</p>
      <p> Off the field, the deadly striker has swag in bucket loads and we check out some of his best looks.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Check out some of his most daring looks in the gallery above.</i>
      </p>
      <p> The Columbian formed part of the deadly ‘CBD’ trident alongside Khama Billiat and Keagan Dolly at Downs.  For Chiefs, he is still alongside Billiat, but they have since formed a new partnership with Serbian workhorse, Samir Nurkovic.</p>

      <p> When he is not a devastating number nine in Amakhosi colours, Castro is a doting dad and husband. A quick look through his Instagram page and it’s easy to see that he is all about family.</p>
      <p> When it comes to his swag, he doesn’t fare too badly either. He is a typical jeans and sneakers kind of guy, though he does clean up well when he goes for a more formal look.</p>
