      <p>A man will serve at least 26 in jail after murdering a father of four who became the innocent victim of a brutal family feud.</p>
      <p>Nabeel Choudhary, 21, from West Bromwich, was part of a group of seven who brutally stabbed Yassir Hussain to death.</p>
      <p>Mr Justice Nicol jailed Choudhary for life and ordered he serve a minimum term of 26 years and 37 days.</p>
      <p>A Birmingham Crown Court trial heard Mr Hussain tried to flee outside the Golden City takeaway in Lower Gornal on December 4 last year but was trapped and hacked to death.</p>
      <p>Mr Hussain's family paid tribute to him as a "gentle" man who was an "innocent" in a <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/black-country/yasir-hussain-murder-family-feud-17173704">long-running family feud</a> that led to the chilling machete attack.</p>
      <p>The court heard how Choudhary had previously threatened his cousin cousin Morrad Hussain, who managed to flee the scene.</p>

      <p>Choudhary was sentenced to life in prison for murder but there was no separate sentence for charges of attempted grievous bodily harm and dangerous driving.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/black-country/we-know-were-people-involved-17178994">police believe more people were involved in the chilling attack</a> , and the investigation continues into the Central Drive incident.</p>
      <p>Choudhary was acquitted of having an imitation firearm and Akarsh Tasleem was acquitted of murder and possessing a bladed article.</p>
      <p>The hearing at Birmingham Crown Court heard how Mr Hussain was visiting family in the area from his home in Nelson near Burnley, where he was a shopkeeper.</p>
      <p>Yasmin Akhtar, one of three sisters of the victim, said in a statement said the family were “broken and destroyed” and that her brother’s death was “unnecessary and cruel”.</p>
      <p>”He was innocent of any of the wrong doings between the families,” she said.</p>
      <p>She it was terrible for her brother to die in the way he did.</p>
      <p>”He was a kind and gentle man, a family man with four children.”</p>
      <p>Miss Akhtar said he is “very much alive” for them.</p>
