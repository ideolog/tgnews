      <p>REUTERS: Australia's Genex Power Ltd on Friday said it won't be able to line up funding for its pumped hydro project until next year, after failing to sign a power sale agreement from the project.</p>
      <p>The setback knocked the small-capitalisation company's shares down to AUS$0.165, off 39per cent, by 0615 GMT, having earlier touched a more than three-year low with a drop of as much as 46per cent.</p>

      <p>Under a preliminary agreement reached last December, Genex had hoped to finalize a power purchase agreement in 2019 with EnergyAustralia and sell an equity stake in the 250 megawatt project to the country's no.3 electricity retailer.</p>
      <p>Genex said on Friday EnergyAustralia, owned by Hong Kong's CLP Holdings , had advised that it could not agree to the deal spelled out in the term sheet last December.</p>
      <p>"In light of this development, Genex wishes to advise that it no longer anticipates that it will reach financial close on the project in calendar 2019," the company said in a statement to the Australian stock exchange.</p>
      <p>As a result of the EnergyAustralia setback, agreements Genex reached for a total of AUS$635 million (US$438.34 million) in funding from the government's Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility and Japan's J-Power would both lapse in December, Genex said.</p>
      <p>Genex said it would work with the government fund, J-Power and EnergyAustralia to restructure the financing, which it now hopes to seal in 2020.</p>
      <p>"There is more work to be done before we can commit long-term," an EnergyAustralia spokesman said in emailed comments, adding that the company hoped an investment decision could be made "sometime next year".</p>
      <p>The project, which Genex plans to build at an abandoned gold mine in outback northern Australia, is seen as the most promising of a range of pumped hydro projects. It would store energy like a battery to back up variable wind and solar power.</p>
