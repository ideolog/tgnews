      <p>With Halloween officially behind us (sob), and Christmas in the not-so-distant future, there's always a weird period of time in November when it's too late to celebrate all things spooky yet too early to crack out your Santa hat. Fear not, as the world of beauty never stops, and there's always some really cool products coming out this time of year. I have selected five <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/where-to-buy-huda-beautys-new-mercury-retrograde-palette-in-the-uk-19260940">new beauty products to buy this November</a>, including makeup and skincare.</p>
      <p>Makeup-wise, it's all about the Huda Beauty new palette this week. Every year, Huda Kattan releases one main eyeshadow palette, packed full with 18 beautiful shades. This year is arguably the best yet, and is perfect for Christmas party season.</p>
      <p>But really, this week is about skincare, and there is plenty to choose from. There's a new skincare brand direct from Korea, which is 'clean' with a scientific edge, as well as a foaming cleanser that is extra boujee. Also out this week are two new CBD products that prove the trend is far from slowing down. With one super affordable and the other a little more decadent, there are options for all budgets.</p>
      <p>Keep reading to find out more about the best new beauty launches this week.</p>
