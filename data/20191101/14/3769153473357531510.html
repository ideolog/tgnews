This tutorial was made for 2D animators and storyboard artists who wants to use grease pencil in Blender as their main tool. It can be followed by non-blender users as I cover the basics again. It covers many techniques such as navigation using a tabel, basic objects manipulation, drawing tools, stroke editing, layers, onion skin, animation, modifiers, VSE scene editing and more... This is my first tutorial in english so I hope it will be clear enough ! Happy Blending !</blockquote>
