      <p>A <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/sex-crime">rapist</a> whose victim had his baby claimed she got pregnant without having sex.</p>
      <p>Lawrence Waller attacked the young woman when she was 19 at a house in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/dumfries">Dumfries</a> in the early 1990s.</p>
      <p>The 59 year-old insisted his diabetes made it "impossible" for him to have sex.</p>
      <p>Waller instead told jurors he, his wife and the victim had a bizarre agreement that the teenager would have a baby for them.</p>
      <p>This was to be done with the help of an ink syringe.</p>

      <p>Waller claimed medics had advised his wife not to get pregnant again following earlier issue when giving birth.</p>
      <p>The victim passed away before the trial.</p>
      <p>But, she had bravely reported her ordeal to police prior to her death.</p>
      <p>Jurors were read a statement by officer of what she said happened to her.</p>
      <p>Prosecutor Mr Keegan had asked Waller during the trial did he know how the victim had passed away.</p>
      <p>But, he replied: "I have no idea how she died."</p>
      <p>The victim got justice from beyond the grave after Waller was convicted of rape at the High Court in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/glasgow">Glasgow</a> .</p>
      <p>He will learn his fate later this month.</p>
      <p>The trial heard how the young woman knew Waller and his wife.</p>
      <p>Jurors heard how she fell pregnant at 19. DNA tests revealed Waller to be the father of the child.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The ex-taxi driver, of Dumfries, claimed in court it was a "shock".</p>
      <p>He told jurors: "My wife and the girl had discussed about wanting to bring another child up."</p>
      <p>Waller denied having sex with the victim - insisting the pregnancy was instead helped with the aid of "syringe used for printer ink".</p>
      <p>His advocate Louise Arrol asked: "Was this agreed by all of you?"</p>
      <p>Waller replied: “It was agreed that the child would live with us She could then claim the child benefit."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>He said his wife had previously had a C-section and had been told not to give birth again.</p>
      <p>But, prosecutor Jim Keegan QC put to Waller: "You had intercourse with her."</p>
      <p>Waller: "Impossible. Physically impossible."</p>
      <p>He insisted his diabetes issues had caused problems.</p>
      <p>The victim has since died due to a heart condition.</p>
      <p>Lord Armstrong deferred sentencing for reports.</p>
