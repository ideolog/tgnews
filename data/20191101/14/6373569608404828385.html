      <h1>Royal Navy's new aircraft carriers have gone green</h1>
      <h2>HMS Prince of Wales has tested its state-of-the-art pyrolysis plants</h2>

      <p>Engineers are testing a green waste disposal system on the Royal Navy's newest aircraft carrier – reducing rubbish aboard one hundred fold.</p>
      <p>A Royal Navy spokesperson said: "During the latest phase of HMS Prince of Wales’ sea trials in the North Sea, sailors are testing her state-of-the-art pyrolysis plants – already fitted to the ship’s older sister HMS Queen Elizabeth – to keep the tonnes of rubbish generated by the 600 sailors and 400 industry engineers and experts on board to a minimum.</p>
      <p>"During her first two visits to Invergordon, the ship offloaded several tonnes of rubbish – ‘gash’ in Royal Navy parlance – a manual, labour-intensive process given that the 1,000 souls aboard produce upwards of nine tonnes of waste  <i>every day</i> , stored in shiny metal drums.</p>
      <p>"Enter the two pyrolysis plants – which cause material to decompose under extreme temperatures.</p>
      <p>"Most waste – including food, sewage and waste oils, including those from the galley, but not metals or glass – can be processed by the plants, which can deal with 150kg of rubbish every hour.</p>

      <p>"The only flame comes from a burner which initially heats the ‘oven’ to 1,100°C – as hot as a large bonfire.</p>
      <p>"The waste then becomes the fuel; the burner switches off and the plant becomes self-sustaining using minimum fuel.</p>
      <p>"So 150kg of waste becomes 1½kg – or one and a half standard bags of sugar. At the end of the process you’re left with some grey-blackish ash, known as char, which is stored in drums until the ship puts into harbour again and the gash can be offloaded.</p>
      <p>As part of the carrier’s trials, the first of the ship’s two pyrolysis plants was fired up to test seals and the operating temperature.</p>
      <p>"After that proved successful, the marine engineers are now putting solid waste through the plant before moving on to food, bio sludge (sewage) and sludge oil.</p>

      <p>Marine Engineering Technician Niall Kelleher, one of the carrier’s junior sailors, is  responsible for operating the rubbish machines.</p>
      <p>He said: "I’m excited to start working with the pyrolysis plant which is something I have never seen before.” </p>
      <p>“I am hoping to gain more knowledge on such equipment which will be extremely useful to me over my career in the RN.</p>
      <p>“The plants’ waste reduction ratio will benefit the ship’s company with us having far less waste to dispose of during ‘out all gash’ – and enable us to store the waste far easier.”</p>
      <p>Petty Officer Graeme Coventry added: "The plant should see us processing all waste with the exception of metals and glass – they will both be crushed to enable us to store them without taking up too much space.</p>

      <p>"This is a fantastic new piece of machinery. It will produce a minimum amount of waste and allow us to reduce our waste by almost 100:1"</p>
