      <h1>Nigel Farage proposes General Election ‘Leave alliance’ to Boris Johnson</h1>

      <p>Nigel Farage has thrown down a General Election gauntlet to Boris Johnson, calling on him to ditch his Brexit deal and form a “Leave alliance”.</p>
      <p>The Brexit Party leader said he will field a candidate in every seat in Britain if the Prime Minister does not drop his EU Withdrawal Agreement and get together in what he said could be a “non-aggression pact”.</p>
      <p>Launching the party’s General Election campaign in Westminster, Mr Farage said the PM’s deal did not represent Brexit and described his “very big, generous offer” as a “one-off opportunity” that would secure Brexit and win the election with a “big stonking majority”.</p>
      <p>Mr Farage said if the Tories did not agree to an alliance and abandoning the deal he would make sure every household in the country was made aware it was a “sell out” of Brexit.</p>
      <p>Addressing a hall packed with journalists, Mr Farage said if Mr Johnson did not agree to his terms his party “will contest every single seat in England, Scotland and Wales”, adding: “I say to Boris Johnson – drop the deal.”</p>
      <p>Mr Farage said: “Of course, I’m open and flexible to local exceptions and already we are in communication with a number of MPs who are prepared to renounce the Withdrawal Agreement, to renounce the deal, and they themselves to stand on a ticket of a genuine free trade agreement or leave on WTO terms.</p>
      <p>“And of course in those cases where MPs say this, we will view them as our friends and not as our enemies.</p>

      <p>“But that is not the real deal. The real deal is a Leave alliance that wins a big majority in Parliament.</p>
      <p>“The real deal is a Leave alliance that delivers a genuine Brexit.”</p>
      <p>It is thought Mr Farage’s party may try to persuade staunch Tory Brexiteers to do a U-turn on their support for Mr Johnson’s Withdrawal Agreement and his party could then leave those Tory candidates to run in their constituency without opposition from the Brexit Party.</p>

      <p>Explaining his idea of a “non-aggression pact”, Mr Farage told the PA news agency: “There are seats in which we would not stand and there are some seats in which the Conservatives would not stand.</p>
      <p>“In particular, old Labour seats that have never ever been Conservative, never ever will be Conservative, where there were Leave majorities in the referendum but they’re represented by Remain MPs.</p>
      <p>“And they, for us, are our number one target.”</p>
      <p>When asked if he would consider no longer supporting the Withdrawal Agreement to avoid a challenge from the Brexit Party, Eurosceptic Mark Francois told PA: “No. I voted for Boris’s deal and I’m sticking with it because it takes us out of the EU.”</p>
      <p>Steve Baker, chairman of the European Research Group of Tory Brexiteers, said he was “at a loss” to know what Mr Farage wants to achieve, adding: “I am no more willing to be bullied by Nigel Farage than anyone else into acting against my best understanding of the national interest.”</p>
      <blockquote>Is Nigel a statesman or a campaigner? We are about to find out</blockquote>
      <p>Mr Baker told PA: “The reason every Conservative Eurosceptic MP backed the deal is that it can deliver a Brexit worth having.</p>
      <p>“But Boris will only negotiate a great future for the UK if he has a good majority of resolute Conservative MPs. Nigel now risks that and our future.</p>
      <p>“It is completely inconceivable that the Conservative Party would now go for no-deal and a pact.</p>
      <p>“Is Nigel a statesman or a campaigner? We are about to find out.”</p>
      <p>Mr Farage said Mr Johnson’s deal is “simply not Brexit”, adding: “So what I’m saying is – it’s a General Election, it’s a chance to press the reset button, drop the deal and let’s move forward and let’s form some kind of Brexit alliance and win the election.”</p>

      <p>US President Donald Trump appeared to call for an electoral pact between Mr Farage and Mr Johnson in a call to LBC.</p>
      <p>He said the pair could become an “unstoppable force”, as well as saying it would be difficult to trade with the UK under Mr Johnson’s Brexit deal.</p>
      <p>Mr Farage, asked about how pleased he was that Mr Trump criticised the PM’s deal, said: “Well I’d known for some time that members of the American administration were very, very worried about what had been signed up to.</p>
      <p>“And Trump made it clear that basically if we go along with the terms of this there’ll never be a trade deal with the USA.”</p>

      <p>A Number 10 spokesman said the PM had not spoken to the US president about his Brexit deal, which was “agreed after they were last in touch”.</p>
      <p>“The PM’s deal takes back control of our money, laws and border and allows us to do trade deals with any country we chose – including the US,” he said.</p>
      <p>Conservative Party chairman James Cleverly said a vote for Mr Farage “risks letting Jeremy Corbyn into Downing Street via the back door – and the country spending 2020 having two referendums on Brexit and Scottish independence”.</p>
