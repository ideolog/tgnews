      <h2>Guardiola in complete agreement with Liverpool rival</h2>

      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Pep_Guardiola">Pep Guardiola</a> is in complete agreement with <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/LiverpoolFC">Liverpool</a> manager <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Jurgen_Klopp">Jurgen Klopp</a> regarding the fixture congestion faced by <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/PremierLeague">Premier League</a> clubs.</p>
      <p>Liverpool are holding discussions with the EFL Cup organisers in order to find a suitable date for their quarter-final with Aston Villa.</p>
      <p>Klopp’s side travel to Qatar to compete in the Club World Cup on the week of 17-18 December, when the other EFL Cup quarter-finals are scheduled to be played.</p>
      <p>The tie is likely to be rearranged for early January, though potential FA Cup third round replays could cause further congestion issues down the line.</p>
      <p>Klopp has suggested Liverpool could pull out of the competition if no viable date is found and Guardiola sympathises with his rival manager.</p>
      <p>“I completely agree,” the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/ManchesterCity">Manchester City</a> manager said. “Less fixtures, less competions, more recovery, we play 27 and 29 [December] in winter time. </p>
      <p>“It is always the debate, in Uefa meetings always they talk about it. I’m with Jurgen when he makes these kind of statements about too much.”</p>
      <p>Like Klopp, Guardiola said he is forced to prioritise competitions and put his faith in young players in the EFL Cup because the workload on his first-team squad is so high.</p>
      <p>“Yes I prioritise by not playing Gundogan and Kevin, no [David] Silva in this competition. I think that Jurgen and Arsenal have done the same.  Except [Manchester] United, for the situation they have. </p>
      <p>“For the others the competition is good to rotate the team and for those other players who don’t play too often. But yes, it is too much.”</p>
