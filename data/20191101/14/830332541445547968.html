      <p>(CNN) - Try to read this story and not hear the song in your head.</p>
      <p>Too late.</p>
      <p>If you aren't hearing "All I Want For Christmas Is You" by Mariah Carey in your mind, you shall soon hear it everywhere else.</p>
      <p>The song celebrates its 25th anniversary this year, and even Carey is excited.</p>
      <p>Early Friday she posted a video on her official Instagram account of her in bed at 11:59 p.m. wearing her Halloween outfit.</p>
      <p>As soon as her phone flips to midnight, we hear the first few notes from her hit as a call comes in from Santa.</p>
      <p>Carey is then miraculously in her Christmas pajamas and tells Santa "It's time!"</p>
      <p>She also posted a video announcing a treat in honor of the anniversary.</p>
      <p>"Kicking off the festivities with <a href="https://mariahcarey.lnk.to/MerryChristmas25">a brand new video cut for All I Want For Christmas Is You</a> (Unreleased Video Footage," Carey wrote in the caption. "Hope you like it!"</p>
      <p>On Friday, Legacy Recordings released Carey's "Merry Christmas 25th Anniversary Deluxe Edition," which includes the original album, plus a disc featuring previously unreleased live tracks from her 1994 St. John The Divine Benefit Concert, rare remixes, a new rendition of the "Sugar Plum Fairy" and additional seasonal tracks.</p>
