      <p>Washington (AFP) - A 36-year-old woman has been found dead with a python wrapped around her neck in a home in the midwestern US state of Indiana which housed around 140 snakes, police said.</p>
      <p>The body of Laura Hurst was discovered on Wednesday in the house in Oxford, Sergeant Kim Riley, a state police spokesman, said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Hurst, of Battle Ground, Indiana, had an eight-foot (2.4-meter) reticulated python wrapped around her neck.</p>
      <p>Medics attempted to revive her but their efforts were unsuccessful.</p>
      <p>"She appears to have been strangled by the snake," Riley told the Lafayette Journal &amp; Courier newspaper. "We do not know that for a fact until after the autopsy."</p>
      <p>The home with the snake collection was owned by the Benton County sheriff, Don Munson, who lived next door, the Journal &amp; Courier said, and Hurst kept about 20 of her own snakes there.</p>
      <p>Munson, who found Hurst's body, told the newspaper that her death appeared to be a "tragic accident."</p>
      <p>Pythons are a non-venomous family of snakes found in Africa, Asia, and Australia that encompasses more than 30 species, including some of the largest snakes in the world.</p>
      <p>They typically grasp prey with sharp, backward-curving teeth before squeezing them tightly to induce a heart attack.</p>
