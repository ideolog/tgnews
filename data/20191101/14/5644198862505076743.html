      <p>A clinical trial of Novartis's Cosentyx drug has failed to prove it is significantly better than a rival treatment for a type of arthritis, the Swiss company said on Friday.</p>
      <p>ZURICH: A clinical trial of Novartis's Cosentyx drug has failed to prove it is significantly better than a rival treatment for a type of arthritis, the Swiss company said on Friday.</p>
      <p>Novartis said Cosentyx, when used to treat active psoriatic arthritis, "narrowly missed statistical significance for superiority" versus Humira, a drug made by AbbVie.</p>

      <p>"While Cosentyx narrowly missed statistical significance for superiority.... it showed numerically higher results versus Humira," Novartis said following the results of a head-to-head trial.</p>
      <p>Psoriatic arthritis, an inflammatory disease affecting the joints, is a condition which affects around 50 million people worldwide.</p>
      <p>This week U.S. regulators halted a trial of Novartis's Zolgensma treatment after an animal study raised safety concerns.</p>
