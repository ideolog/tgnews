      <h1>Brighton v Norwich: match preview</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T14:29:23+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 14:29</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/01/Guardian%20Staff" target="_blank">Guardian Staff</a></address>
      <p>Brighton have turned the Amex Stadium into something of a fortress this season, having lost just once at home in the league and Graham Potter is eager for his team to continue their good form with victory over Norwich. Aaron Mooy will return to the squad from suspension but Potter may not want to change a winning formula after victory over Everton last time out. Daniel Farke’s side have mustered just a single point on the road since promotion and they have lost four of their last five matches but the German is staying upbeat. “We are not so addicted to the table,” Farke said. “I want this attitude that we are addicted to winning games.” <b>Ben Fisher</b></p>
