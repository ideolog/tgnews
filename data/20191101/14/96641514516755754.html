      <p>After <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/10/21/diablo-iv-blizzcon-blizzard-hint/">leaks suggested as such,</a> Blizzard officially announced <i>Diablo IV</i> at BlizzCon. It started the event's opening ceremony with an impressively gruesome cinematic trailer that gives a sense of the action RPG's vibe.</p>

      <p>The publisher confirmed <i>Diablo IV </i>will mark a return to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/11/02/diablo-immortal-brings-blizzards-action-rpg-to-ios-and-androi/">series'</a> dark, gothic, medieval version of Hell. You can expect the brutal combat the franchise is known for, along with a variety of monsters and plenty of loot to seek out.</p>
      <p><i>Diablo IV</i> will support solo and co-op play and you might even encounter other players you can take on in PVP combat. Blizzard <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191101005550/en/Diablo%C2%AE-IV-Revealed">promised</a> that, for the first time, "Sanctuary will be a contiguous, seamless landmass" which connects five regions.</p>
      <p>Three classes have been confirmed so far: Barbarian, Sorceress and Druid. You'll be able to customize your character via gear, talent trees, skills, runes and mounts. Blizard also said the game will offer "endless playability and progression."</p>
      <p><i>Diablo IV </i>takes place "many years" after <i><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/09/13/diablo-iii-switch-november-2-release-date/">Diablo III</a></i>. It doesn't have a release date as yet, but it's coming to PC, Xbox One and PS4.</p>
