      <h2>A third teaser for I'm A Celebrity 2019 shows hosts Ant McPartlin and Dec Donnelly tackling stormy seas</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T16:30:46+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 16:30</time> by <a rel="author">Sara-Aisha Kent, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/sara-aisha-kent/</a></address>
      <p>ITV have released another funny teaser for I'm A Celebrity 2019, featuring hosts Ant McPartlin and Dec Donnelly, ahead of the jungle show starting.</p>
      <p>An initial teaser earlier this month saw Ant and Dec lost and requiring help from fans to send them on their way to the Australian jungle.</p>
      <p>It did not appear they're getting anywhere though, with viewers choosing for them to face Arctic Antics as the next part of the journey.</p>
      <p>The next destination for the pair, which was also voted by TV watchers, shows them tackling stormy seas in a small wooden boat.</p>
      <p>The new promo will premiere for the first time on ITV on Friday night.</p>

      <p>In the short footage, Ant and Dec are clad in yellow raincoats as waves lap around them as they battle the elements in the tiny dinghy.</p>
      <p>Dec shouts over the wind: "I should warn you I am a terrible swimmer!"</p>
      <p>Ant replies: “A terrible singer? I know I have heard ya!"</p>

      <p>As Dec wraps his arms in inflatable armbands and begins to blow them up, Ant jibes: “At least things can’t get any worse.”</p>
      <p>Speaking too soon, a bolt of lightening hits the boat and punctures a hole in the side.</p>
      <p>As water spurts into the vessel, Dec exclaims: “Ah! We are sinking!”</p>
      <p>Before instructing: “All hands on Dec!”</p>

      <p>The duo cling onto one another as Ant shouts: “Its not working!”</p>
      <p>Dec then screams: “What are we going to do" before the I'm A Celebrity theme tune plays.</p>
      <p>But where will the boys end up next? Viewers can decide by selecting either 'Nature Calls' or 'Safety First' on the I'm A Celeb app.</p>
