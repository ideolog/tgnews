      <p>Detectives investigating a series of break-ins across the Black Country have charged a fourth man.</p>

      <p>The 27-year-old is due to appear before Walsall Magistrates' Court tomorrow (November 2).</p>
      <p>Thomas Wall and Michael Connors, both aged 21 and Michael Wall, 25, and all from Wrexham, were previously charged with conspiracy to burgle.</p>

      <p>They appeared before Walsall Magistrates Court on October 24 and were remanded in custody to appear at a later date.</p>
      <p>Detectives are continuing to probe the series of burglaries across the region and are appealing for anyone with information to contact officers.</p>
      <p>Detective Inspector Jim Mahon, from Force CID, said: "I would like to thank the community for their support in this investigation. Although these charges are a major step forward, we are still appealing to anyone with any information relating to the other burglaries across the Black Country to speak to us.</p>
      <p>“We don’t underestimate the impact such crimes have on our communities and the widespread anxiety and distress they cause.</p>
      <p>"We would continue to ask the public to remain vigilant and not to open their doors if they are unsure who is visiting.</p>
      <p>"We ask that communities to look out for any people or vehicles acting suspiciously in their neighbourhoods and report them to us."</p>
