      <h1>Shoppers bewildered by ASOS chain skirt and say clothes get 'worse and worse'</h1>
      <h2>ASOS shoppers have been left well and truly baffled by a leather and chain skirt being sold by the retailer</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T16:12:09+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 16:12</time> by <a rel="author">Courtney Pochin, https://www.facebook.com/courtneypochinmirror/?modal=admin_todo_tour</a></address>
      <p>It's no secret that <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/asos">ASOS</a> sell some rather bizarre items.</p>
      <p>From <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/weird-news/asos-baffles-people-faux-wireless-20385836">faux wireless headphones</a> to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/style/shopping/asos-shopper-confused-bin-bag-20377816">a skirt</a> that people think looks like a "bin bag".</p>
      <p>But one of their latest offerings is bound to boggle you.</p>
      <p>The online retailer is selling a <a href="https://www.asos.com/kikiriki/kikiriki-chain-detail-cutout-skirt-with-pu-panel-detail-in-metal/prd/13533071?clr=black&amp;colourWayId=16483288&amp;SearchQuery=chain+detail+skirt">£65 skirt</a> called the 'Kikiriki chain detail cutout skirt with pu panel detail in metal'.</p>
      <p>And it might just be the most ridiculous piece of clothing we've ever seen, with a strip of leather between the legs to cover modesty and chains holding it together around the bum and thighs.</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.asos.com/kikiriki/kikiriki-chain-detail-cutout-skirt-with-pu-panel-detail-in-metal/prd/13533071?clr=black&amp;colourWayId=16483288&amp;SearchQuery=chain+detail+skirt">website</a> description says the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fashion">garment</a> is "cut close to the body" and they certainly aren't kidding.</p>
      <p>The body-hugging skirt shows off plenty of skin, with exposed areas on the buttocks and around the bikini line.</p>
      <p>It doesn't exactly look like something you'd be able to wear a comfy pair of knickers underneath.</p>
      <p>A picture of the skirt was shared on the parody <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> account, @asbos_sos where they compared it to a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/halloween">Halloween</a> costume.</p>
      <p>They wrote: "This Halloween go as that thing u found in ur parents drawers when u were 12."</p>
      <p>Over 1,000 people have liked the post so far with many taking the time to comment on it.</p>
      <p>One person was less than impressed and said ASOS outfits just keep getting "worse and worse".</p>
      <p>They commented: "Jesus Christ they get worse and worse."</p>
      <p>Another user replied: "Looks a bit chilly for trick or treating..."</p>
      <p>A third simply added: "Lol omg."</p>
