      <h1>Toronto approves Google's surveillance city, despite leaks revealing Orwellian plans</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T16:53:23+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 16:53</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://boingboing.net/author/cory_doctorow_1" target="_blank">Cory Doctorow</a></address>
      <p>Yesterday, Waterfront Toronto unanimously approved the continuation of Sidewalk Labs's plans for "Quayside," a privatised, surveillance-oriented "smart city" that has been mired in controversy since its earliest days, including <a href="https://boingboing.net/2018/02/15/corporate-taz.html">secret bullying campaigns</a>, <a href="https://boingboing.net/2018/10/04/data-colonialism.html">mass resignations of privacy advisors</a>, <a href="https://boingboing.net/2018/12/21/2600-acres.html">lies that drastically understated the scope of the project</a>, <a href="https://boingboing.net/2019/04/17/waterfront-toronto.html">civil liberties lawsuits</a>, and <a href="https://boingboing.net/2019/10/27/broken-promises-2.html">denunciations by the indigenous elders</a> who were consulted on the project.</p>
      <p>The vote came one day after the <a href="https://boingboing.net/2019/10/30/citizen-scores-eh.html">Globe and Mail reported on a leaked document</a> that showed that the company had initially planned to build an autonomous corporate-owned city, with private taxation, private roads, charter schools, corporate cops and judges, and punishments for people who choose privacy.</p>
      <p>Sidewalk Labs is a division of Alphabet, Google's parent company.</p>
      <p>The approval came after Sidewalk Labs made some concessions, agreeing to scale back Quayside to the initial 4.8 hectare sight, not the 77-hectare site the company secretly secured permission to build on and then lied about. It also promised to follow Canadian data-protection laws, including storing data from the project in Canadian data-centres.</p>
      <blockquote>Toronto Mayor John Tory released a statement welcoming news of the vote result. <br/><br/>"We all know that we must develop our waterfront in the right way — that's why we are moving through this process so carefully," Tory said. <br/><br/>"I believe this process has led to an exciting proposal for Quayside that has the potential to create new jobs and economic development opportunities, a carbon-neutral neighbourhood, and more affordable housing units. It is a real opportunity for Toronto."</blockquote>
