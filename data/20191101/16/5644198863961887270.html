      <p>SHANGHAI: China's tobacco regulator on Friday (Nov 1) issued a notice asking e-commerce platforms and businesses to shut online stores that sell electronic cigarette products, in a move aimed at stopping minors from purchasing e-cigarettes through the Internet.</p>
      <p>The notice comes not long after online platforms and retailers in the US launched similar takedowns amid government scrutiny toward vaping's effect on public health.</p>

      <p>It also arrives as a bevvy of Chinese startups race to capture a piece of China's massive potential market for e-cigarettes.</p>
      <p>The notice, which was dated Oct 30, was published one day later on the website of state monopoly China Tobacco, which is overseen by the country's tobacco regulator.</p>
      <p>In order to "further strengthen the protection of the physical and mental health of minors", the regulator "urges e-cigarette producers, retailers, or individual sellers to temporarily close online sales websites or channels" and "urges e-commerce platform to temporarily close e-cigarette shops", the regulator stated.</p>
      <p>China is home to over 300 million smokers, making it the world's largest market for smokers.</p>
      <p>In recent years Chinese startups have taken venture capital money and launched products with similar design characteristics to those made by Juul - the e-cigarette company backed by Altria Group Inc that swept the United States with its compact form factor and potent nicotine salt formulation.</p>
      <p>Relx, founded by former employees of Uber China, and Snow+, founded by a team of former bitcoin entrepreneurs, are among the domestic market leaders.</p>
      <p>The companies currently operate in a regulatory gray area in China, as no national-level rules exist that provide standards for the safe manufacture and sale of nicotine salt-based e-cigarettes.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, China Tobacco operates as a state-backed monopoly, controlling the sale and distribution of all tobacco products across the country. The unit also generates nearly 6 per cent of the country's total tax revenue, according to government figures.</p>
      <p>In September, an official Juul online store briefly appeared on Chinese e-commerce sites run by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and JD.com, only to disappear days later. Juul and the retailers did not comment on the store's abrupt takedown at the time.</p>
      <p>In a public statement, Relx said it will comply with the regulator's notice and shut down its online sales channels. Snow+ told Reuters it would comply with the regulations as well.</p>
      <p>Alibaba and JD.com did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>
      <p>Over the past year, Walmart, Walgreens, and other American retailers have pulled e-cigarettes from their shelves, following a public health scare over their impact on minors.</p>
