      <p>“We did get a report yesterday of possibly some fake firefighters out there, wanting to do some looting,” Kincade Fire. Sgt. Shawn Murphy <a href="https://abc7news.com/officials-investigating-reports-of-fake-firefighters-near-kincade-fire/5658797/">told</a> firefighters during a briefing.</p>
      <p>‘You guys don’t want that, you don’t want a couple of idiots to ruin your outstanding reputation, so if you see them please report them to us. Check their credentials. Let’s get them out of there,’ Murphy <a href="https://abc7news.com/officials-investigating-reports-of-fake-firefighters-near-kincade-fire/5658797/">added</a>.</p>
      <p>Thus far, no suspects impersonating firefighters have been identified by law enforcement.</p>
      <p>Three reports of looting have been reported, though no arrests were made</p>
      <p>“They’re taking advantage knowing that first responders, police, everyone is so busy. It’s very disheartening,” <a href="https://abc7news.com/officials-investigating-reports-of-fake-firefighters-near-kincade-fire/5658797/">said</a> Santa Rosa resident Jennie Cormie.</p>
      <p>“That’s the most terrible thing I’ve ever heard,” <a href="https://abc7news.com/officials-investigating-reports-of-fake-firefighters-near-kincade-fire/5658797/">added</a> Healdsburg resident Shaun Brewer. “Anybody pretending to do that, that’s just total fraud.”</p>
      <p>The Kincade blaze, which began on October 23rd, has burned 76,825 acres of land. The fire has destroyed 282 structures and is only 60% contained, according to Cal Fire.</p>
