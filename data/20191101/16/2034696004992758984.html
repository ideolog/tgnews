      <p>Hart starred in the sitcom from 1996 to 2003. Last year, a new reboot called <a href="https://www.nme.com/blogs/tv-blogs/everything-we-know-about-the-new-sabrina-the-teenage-witch-reboot-2361256"><i>The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina</i></a> came to Netflix, starring Kiernan Shipka in Hart’s old role.</p>
      <p>A second series of the show followed earlier this year, with seasons 3 and 4 already in the works.</p>
      <p>In <a href="https://www.nme.com/blogs/tv-blogs/netflix-chilling-adventures-sabrina-review-wickedly-charming-2393969">a review of the first season of</a> <i>The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina, NME’s </i>Hannah Mylrea said the show was “a million miles from the 90s classic, but a wickedly charming watch”.</p>
      <p>“Not without it’s flaws, as in Aguirre-Sacasa’s <i>Riverdale</i> it can be outrageously over the top, and a little silly; but in general <i>The Chilling Adventures Of Sabrina</i> is wickedly enticing watch. Move over gory horror films, here’s your Halloween viewing, it’ll definitely be more fun.”</p>
