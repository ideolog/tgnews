      <p>Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Iran-backed <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/hezbollah.html">Hezbollah</a>, has called for the quick formation of a new Lebanese government that must listen to the demands of protesters and work to restore confidence.</p>
      <p>In a televised speech on Friday, Nasrallah said Prime Minister <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/10/analysis-saad-hariri-resigned-lebanons-pm-next-191029160011505.html">Saad Hariri</a>'s resignation, prompted by large protests against the ruling elite, had frozen the government's reform plans.</p>
      <p>Hariri's resignation, which Hezbollah opposed, has left <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/lebanon.html">Lebanon</a> without a government as it faces the worst economic crisis since the 1975-1990 civil war.</p>

      <p>"A new government must be formed as soon as possible ... and the new government must listen to the demands of the people who took to the streets," Nasrallah said.</p>
      <p>"There must be serious work because time is tight and so is people's patience," he said.</p>
      <p>Mass protests erupted across Lebanon on October 17 against plans to tax calls on WhatsApp and other messaging services.</p>
      <p>The demonstrations quickly turned into wider grievances, with calls for the resignation of the government and bringing corrupt officials to accountability.</p>
      <p>The government announced a series of reform plans, but with no concrete steps, it failed to placate protesters or reassure multilateral lenders enough to release billions in badly-needed aid they had pledged.</p>
      <p>Protesters said the sectarian political system on which the government is based, is problematic as it spawns patronage and clientelism. They are demanding a new government to be formed, comprised of technocrats unaffiliated with the political class.</p>
      <p>Lebanon's political system guarantees political representation for all 18 sects in the country, a legacy of French colonial rule. Seats in the cabinet and the parliament are divided between Christians and Muslims.</p>
      <p>Positions in the public sector are also divided among religious groups.</p>
      <h3>Banks reopenÂ </h3>
      <p>Meanwhile, Lebanese banks, which had been closed since October 18, <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/ajimpact/queues-lebanon-banks-reopen-week-closure-191101124742258.html">reopened on Friday</a>, with queues outside the buildings and customers encountering new curbs on transfers abroad and withdrawals from US dollar accounts.</p>
      <p>Though no formal controls were imposed, banks told customers they could only transfer funds abroad in particular circumstances such as repaying loans, education, health, family support or commercial commitments.</p>
      <p>The Lebanese pound strengthened against the US dollar on the parallel market that has emerged in recent months, three dealers said.</p>
      <p>The central bank had promised not to impose capital controls when banks reopened, measures that could hamper the currency inflows and investment that Lebanon badly needs.</p>
      <p>Asked about steps being taken by banks, banking association chief Salim Sfeir said: "I would not call it restrictions but rather efforts by the banks to accommodate all customers, given the pressure resulting from closing for two weeks."</p>
      <p>"We stand ready to adjust any measure taken, once the situation in the country is back to normal," he told Reuters.</p>
