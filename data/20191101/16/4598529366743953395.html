      <p>The House’s <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/infographic-tracking-the-status-of-the-impeachment-inquiry">impeachment inquiry</a> is ramping up. But the White House is apparently not concerned about its messaging efforts.</p>
      <p>When asked by Fox News anchor Bill Hemmer Friday morning about the fate of White House briefings, a day after the House voted to formally approve procedures for the impeachment inquiry, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham responded “whenever it’s time.”</p>
      <p>Grisham has repeatedly shot down any hopes for the return of the “daily briefings” which have been <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/28/politics/trump-white-house-daily-press-briefing/index.html">on hiatus since March</a>. Last September, Grisham explained that briefings were killed because reporters <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/white-house-press-secretary-grisham-trump-press-briefings">“weren’t being good”</a> to President Trump’s people.</p>
      <p>“Right now we’re doing just fine,” Grisham told Fox Friday. “The President continues to speak to the American people. He continues to speak to the press — so do I. My press team and I are available 24/7.”</p>
      <p>Asked again by Hemmer if there is a plan for a White House briefing to “get a sense of what is happening behind the scenes,” Grisham once again insisted that there are no briefing plans scheduled, but that it could change at any moment.</p>
      <p>“There is no plan right now, but as with anything in our White House, that could change in five minutes,” Grisham said.</p>
      <p>Hemmer then responded, “Or five seconds?” to which Grisham laughingly responded: “Exactly right.”</p>
