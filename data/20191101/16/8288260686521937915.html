      <h2>Aston Villa latest - The Reds boss has been discussing an issue which could impact his team selection for this weekend's clash with Villa this weekend.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T16:00:00+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 16:00</time> by <a rel="author">Jamie Kemble</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool manager <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/jurgen-klopp">Jurgen Klopp</a> is unsure of whether to risk midfielder Fabinho against <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a> this weekend.</p>
      <p>The Brazilian midfielder is just one yellow card away from receiving a suspension which would rule him out of a top-of-the-table clash with Manchester City next week.</p>
      <p>And that could force <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/jurgen-klopp">Klopp</a> to leave him out against <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa</a> this weekend, ensuring he will be available for that key clash at Anfield a week on Sunday.</p>
      <p>"I don't know yet," Klopp replied when asked if he will be risking Fabinho.</p>
      <p>"We have to see. I know it (the potential suspension), of course. What we do with that I don't know."</p>

      <p>Asked what he would tell Fabinho should he play, Klopp joked: "No challenges at all!"</p>
      <p>He continued: "That's not possible against Aston Villa, playing without challenges, especially in that position. You cannot ask for this.</p>

      <p>"The player knows it, I know it. Is there any game where you think that's a good game to get a fifth yellow card?</p>
      <p>"Maybe other teams are pretty smart in that and take them, I don't know, I never did it.</p>
      <p>"We have to deal with. Maybe he has to deal with it on the pitch or I have to deal with it with the line-up. We didn't make a final decision yet, so we will see."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Klopp also provided injury updates on Naby Keita and Joel Matip.</p>
      <p>"Naby I don't know yet, we will see," added the Liverpool boss.</p>
      <p>"Joel is not available for the next few weeks.</p>
      <p>"What could that mean? A couple is two, right? So a few is more than three."</p>
