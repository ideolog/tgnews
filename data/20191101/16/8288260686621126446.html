      <p>Stoke City are in limbo ahead of their clash with <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/west-bromwich-albion-fc">West Bromwich Albion</a> early next week.</p>
      <p>The two teams are set to do battle at the bet355 Stadium on Monday night, and ahead of the game, the Potters have axed manager Nathan Jones.</p>
      <p>Jones has been sacked after an ill-fated seven months in charge, leaving Stoke just one place off the bottom of the table and four points from safety.</p>
      <p>The Welshman arrived at Stoke in January, leaving Luton Town to take over from Gary Rowett.</p>
      <p>Stoke are now left searching for a new manager ahead of Monday's clash with the league-leading <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/west-bromwich-albion-fc">Baggies</a> with second-place Preston's Alex Neil favourite.</p>
