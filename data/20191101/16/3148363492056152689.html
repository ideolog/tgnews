      <p>“Like anyone else, I was just very glad and overwhelmed with all that he’s been through…that he realized there’s a place in your heart that only God can fill – no championship rings, no woman, no amount of money — only Christ can fill that place that he designed,” pastor Vernon <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/lamar-odom-jesus-saved-church">told</a> Fox News. “I think that Lamar has come to that place in his life where he knows what’s lasting and eternal. I’m overjoyed for him.</p>
      <p>“It takes time to become the Christian that I know he wants to be,” Vernon added, “and we’re committed to helping him find a good local church in the city that he’s in and I encouraged him to read the gospels 20 minutes every day and commit himself to Jesus through prayer.”</p>
      <p>Odom was temporarily placed in a medically induced coma in 2015 after being found on the verge of an overdose death.</p>
      <p>The former NBA player was <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2015/10/13/report-lamar-odom-clings-to-life-after-being-found-unconscious-in-nevada-brothel/">hospitalized</a> after being found unconscious at a Nevada brothel. He reportedly had several drugs in his system, including opiates and cocaine, and several of his organs had begun shutting down.</p>
      <p>In July, Odom and his two children visited the burial site of the seventh Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson.</p>
      <p>“I heard he makes miracles happen,” <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2019/07/23/lamar-odom-and-kids-visit-miracle-maker-lubavitcher-rebbes-gravesite/">Odom wrote</a>. “It’s a miracle to be here at this place with my children, reflecting on a better life we will build together.”</p>
