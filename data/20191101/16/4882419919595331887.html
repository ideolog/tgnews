      <p>Ansu Fati started against Real Valladolid in midweek bit it's looking tough for him to play regularly with all Barcelona's forwards fit and available again.</p>
      <p>Earlier this season he was a big help and, despite the dilemma he's now facing, coach Ernesto Valverde doesn't regret giving him his chance even though everything has moved quickly since.</p>
      <p>"Of course I don't regret bringing him into the first team early in the season," Valverde said on Friday. "We had a shortage of players in attack and we needed cover.</p>
      <p>"And in addition, he has come in and he's demonstrating a lot of qualities. He's very young, he has a lot of room to grow. In principle, he's in the first-team setup, knowing that he could play some games with the B team, but the decision was well taken.</p>
      <p>Ansu, who turned 17 this week, has been spectacular at times but Valverde says it's normal that he won't always be at that level as he continues to grow.</p>
      <p>The coach added: "I know that when a new player comes (out of the academy) and in such a stunning way as he did, it generates a huge amount of exception.</p>
      <p>"But at the end of the day, things are how they are. He turned 17 this week. He's still not got used to the (top flight) and it's a learning process. He has to learn how to manage the rhythm of the games, how to look after his body, he still needs to get stronger."</p>
