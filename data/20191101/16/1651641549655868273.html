        <b>Mario Kart Tour, the mobile game spinoff of the Mario Kart series, is officially getting a multiplayer beta in December 2019. The catch? It’s paywalled.</b>
      </p>
      <p>As the official <a href="https://twitter.com/mariokarttourEN/status/1190074083100123137">Mario Kart Tour Twitter confirmed</a>, only those who have subscribed to the Mario Kart Tour Gold Pass will be allowed to access the real-time multiplayer beta test.</p>

      <p>The Gold Pass costs $4.99/£4.99 a month. Those who buy the Gold Pass can get exclusive ‘Gold Gifts’ from taking part in certain races and also receive access to the ‘Too Fast’ 200CC class, which is the game’s fastest type of race.</p>
      <p>While it’s not uncommon for beta tests to only be available to select members of a game’s user-base, some fans still feel slighted by the decision. The good news is that only the beta test is hidden behind a paywall and the actual multiplayer feature will hopefully be available to all Mario Kart Tour players. Hopefully.</p>
      <p>At the moment, the way Mario Kart Tour works is similar to the single-player mode of the main games in that the player races against bots instead of real-person opponents.</p>
      <p><a href="https://mspoweruser.com/mario-kart-tour-set-to-race-onto-mobile-devices-next-month/">The game is free-to-start</a>, but contains microtransactions. As mentioned above, the game’s fastest races are locked behind the Gold Pass, but free players still have access to 50CC, 100CC, and 150CC races.</p>
      <p>Mario Kart Tour also resembles gacha games in that you have to pay a special in-game currency in order to ‘pull’ new items such as racers and kart cosmetics. While you can get the currency by logging in daily and completing tasks, the game makes it quite evident that paying real-life money for it would make everything go a lot faster.</p>
      <p>If you want to play Mario Kart Tour for yourself, you can get it on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1293634699">Apple App Store here</a> and on the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nintendo.zaka">Google Play Store here</a>. A Nintendo account is required to play.</p>
