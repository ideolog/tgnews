      <p>REUTERS: British car dealership Lookers on Friday issued its second profit warning in less than four months and announced the departure of its two top executives.</p>
      <p>The company expects annual underlying profit to fall by more than two-thirds as the UK car market struggles with dwindling consumer confidence and margin pressures.</p>

      <p>Lookers said Chairman Phil White will become executive chairman as Chief Executive Andy Bruce and operations chief Nigel McMinn would leave the company immediately.</p>
      <p>Lookers, which warned in July that profit would be below market expectations, said challenges have been worse than expected since mid-September.</p>
      <p>The British car industry has been hit by lower vehicle sales amid uncertainty caused by stricter emissions regulations, Britain's impending exit from the European Union and a shift towards sales of electric or hybrid cars.</p>
      <p>It now expects underlying profit before tax for the full year to be 20 million pounds (US$25.91 million).</p>
      <p>Lookers, which sells vehicles for multiple automakers including Volkswagen , Ford and Germany's BMW , reported adjusted pre-tax profit of 67.3 million pounds in 2018.</p>
      <p>The company, which had disclosed a regulatory probe and the exit of its finance chief earlier this year, said it would shut 15 dealerships and take a one-off hit of 8 million pounds.</p>
