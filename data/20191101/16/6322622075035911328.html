      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 1): Based on corporate announcements and news flow today, companies that may be in focus on Monday (Nov 4) may include the following: Media Prima Bhd, Genting Malaysia Bhd, Sumatec Resources Bhd, Ivory Properties Group Bhd, Hengyuan Refining Co Bhd, Petron Malaysia Refining &amp; Marketing Bhd, Mudajaya Group Bhd, Heng Huat Resources Group Bhd, Atta Global Group Bhd and Cycle &amp; Carriage Bintang Bhd.</p>
      <p><b>Media Prima Bhd</b> is embarking on a second round of staff rationalisation, with the group pledging a fair and equitable compensation package for all affected employees.</p>
      <p>The announcement confirms TheEdgeMarkets’ report earlier today that the group was mulling over a staff rationalisation exercise.</p>
      <p>In November last year, Media Prima's subsidiary Sistem Televisyen Malaysia Bhd, which operates free-to-air television station TV3, gave 190 employees three months' notice of its intention to retrench them, while offering a mutual separation scheme (MSS) to 43 others.</p>
      <p><b>Genting Malaysia Bhd</b>'s unit Genting UK PLC has entered into an agreement to buy LeoVegas Mobile Gaming Group's subsidiary Authentic Gaming for €15 million (RM70 million) to grow Genting's online gaming presence.</p>
      <p>Tycoon Tan Sri Halim Saad said the board of <b>Sumatec Resources Bhd</b> is still confident of keeping the company afloat, following the announcement of the indefinite suspension of its shares starting next week.</p>
      <p>Halim said Sumatec had, after its restructuring in 2013, assured shareholders that it was debt free — the condition before his entry into the company.</p>
      <p>Halim had a direct interest of 540.18 million shares or 12.7% of Sumatec as at March 21, 2018, according to the company’s 2017 annual report. A year prior, he held close to 20% equity stake in Sumatec, the annual report 2016 show.</p>
      <p>The company slipped into PN17 when its external auditors expressed a disclaimer of opinion on the company's audited financial statements for the financial year ended Dec 31, 2017.</p>
      <p>The group received a petition last August from its bondholders demanding payment of RM83.31 million from three collaterialised loans they had extended to Sumatec.</p>
      <p><b>Ivory Properties Group Bhd</b> is disposing of its 45% interest in a Penang-based property development company for RM56.09 million. The buyer is Hemat Tuah Sdn Bhd, which currently owns the other 55% stake in the company, Tropicana Ivory Sdn Bhd (TISB).</p>
      <p>It said the disposal of the stake will enable it to realise gains from its investment in TISB and focus on other project developments.</p>
      <p>TISB was originally a JV between Ivory and Tropicana Corp Bhd. Tropicana had on Oct 26 last year sold its 55% stake to Hemat Tuah.</p>
      <p><b>Hengyuan Refining Co Bhd</b> and <b>Petron Malaysia Refining &amp; Marketing Bhd</b> said crude oil intake at their respective refineries at Port Dickson has normalised after repair work was completed at their crude oil offloading facilities there.</p>
      <p>The two groups said repair work for the crude oil offloading facilities known as the single-buoy mooring (SBM) system was completed yesterday.</p>
      <p>They had announced technical problems at their SBM facilities on Oct 22.</p>
      <p><b>Mudajaya Group Bhd</b> said Yakin Setiamas Sdn Bhd has emerged as a substantial shareholder in the builder after acquiring 162.33 million shares or a 27.52% stake on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>It also said that Dataran Sentral (M) Sdn Bhd ceased to be a substantial shareholder in Mudajaya after selling the 27.52% stake.</p>
      <p>Ooi Chieng Sim, the executive chairman of <b>Atta Global Group Bhd</b>, is wearing the same hat in <b>Heng Huat Resources Group Bhd</b> now.</p>
      <p>Ooi holds a 17.38% stake in Heng Huat through Skylitech Resources Sdn Bhd. He is the second largest shareholder of the company.</p>
      <p>He took over the role from Datuk Juzilman Basir, who resigned as the independent and non-executive chairman.</p>
      <p><b>Cycle &amp; Carriage Bintang Bhd</b> (C&amp;C) has sunk into its fourth straight quarter of losses, posting a net loss of RM12.24 million in its third quarter ended Sept 30, 2019, against a net profit of RM3.51 million in the previous corresponding quarter, due to lower sales and weaker margins.</p>
      <p>The group recorded a loss per share of 12.15 sen, versus earnings per share of 3.48 sen previously.</p>
      <p>Quarterly revenue contracted 39.4% to RM258.87 million from RM427.21 million.</p>
