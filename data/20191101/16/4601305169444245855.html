      <h1>Chicago teachers declare victory after 11-day strike</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T16:43:49+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 16:43</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://boingboing.net/author/cory_doctorow_1" target="_blank">Cory Doctorow</a></address>
      <p>After 11 days, <a href="https://boingboing.net/2019/10/16/solidarity-forever-and-ever.html">Chicago's teacher's strike</a> is at an end, with the city agreeing to the majority of the union's demands, including: higher pay, limits on class sizes, a nurse and social worker in each school, 120 new "equity positions" (librarians, counselors and restorative justice coordinators), bilingual/special ed educators, and five make-up days for teachers and students to compensate for part of the missed instructional calendar.</p>
      <p>The teachers did not win all their demands: most notably, the city did not address the 17,000 homeless students in the system, nor did it give elementary teachers their requested daily 30-minute morning prep period.</p>
      <p>The agreement has won tentative support from the rank-and-file, and a formal vote of all 25,000 members is expected to ratify the deal.</p>
      <blockquote>In addition to guaranteeing all CTU members a 16% raise over the life of the five-year contract, the offer invests $35 million in reducing class sizes – up $10 million from the city's previous offer. <br/><br/>On staffing, the city's offer guarantees that every school will have a nurse and social worker by 2023. The offer includes 120 new "equity positions" for highest-need schools – such as counselors, restorative justice coordinators and librarians – and additional staffing in bilingual and special education.</blockquote>
