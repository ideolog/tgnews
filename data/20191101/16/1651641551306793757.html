      <h1>Apple’s Netflix competitor finally launches with 1 year free trial</h1>

      <p>Apple has now officially launched its<a href="https://mspoweruser.com/apple-tvgoes-on-air-on-november-1-to-compete-with-netflix-disney/"> Apple TV Plus Streaming service</a>. The service, aimed to take on Netflix and Amazon Prime, is now available for users in over 100 countries — including iPhones, Macs and Amazon Fire TVs among others.</p>
      <p>“Audiences in over 100 countries and regions can now enjoy Apple TV+, home to an all-original lineup of powerful shows and movies from today’s greatest storytellers,”<a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/11/apple-tv-plus-is-now-available/"> said Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president of Internet Software and Services</a>. “It was important for us to make it easy for everyone to watch across all their favourite screens, so Apple TV+ is the most broadly available Apple service ever from day one.”</p>
      <p>The service comes with a host of new original content, including Oprah’s Book Club, The Morning Show, and Snoopy in Space.</p>
      <p>Apple TV Plus comes with a one-year free trial. Once the trial is over, it’ll set you back $4.99 a month. However, as is customary for Apple services, cancelling the free trial means losing access to the service immediately so users should be really certain they don’t want access to the service anymore should they opt to cancel.</p>
