      <p>CASTLE ROCK, Colo. (AP) — A woman accused of killing her 7-year-old daughter previously believed to be seriously ill appeared before a Colorado judge with the woman’s former friend watching.</p>
      <p>Ruby King says she traveled from Texas to see Kelly Turner in court on Friday for a procedural hearing.</p>
      <p>It was Turner’s first appearance since it was revealed that she had been charged with murder in the 2017 death of her daughter Olivia Gant.</p>
      <p>Turner has not entered a plea, and her attorney did not immediately return a call for comment.</p>
      <p>King told reporters it didn’t make sense for Turner and the sick girl to move to Colorado around 2013 from Crosby, Texas, and the well-regarded children’s hospital in nearby Houston.</p>
      <p>She says she is angry with Turner but prays for the woman who used to sit beside her in church.</p>
