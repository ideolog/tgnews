      <p>Franklin County Prosecutor Ron O’Brien <a href="https://www.10tv.com/article/columbus-uber-driver-charged-rape-customer-2019-nov">reports</a> that the alleged rape occurred on April 7 after a 24-year-old woman ordered an Uber to get home from a night out, WBNS Channel 10 reported.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors say that Uber driver Abdirizak Abdullahi Aden, 28, picked the woman up but took her to a secluded location unknown to the customer and then entered the back seat and raped her.</p>
      <p>“This man knew she was alone and vulnerable,” the prosecutor said.</p>
      <p>The county prosecutor added that when the suspect finally took the woman to her apartment complex, another Uber driver happened to be delivering a fare and saw Aden pulling a crying woman out of the backseat of his car.</p>
      <p>Officials took out a warrant for Aden’s arrest, and noted they expect the man to appear for an arraignment at the Franklin County Common Pleas Court.</p>
