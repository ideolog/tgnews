      <p><a href="https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/youngthug/profile/">Young Thug</a> has been pushing the release of his new project, <i>So Much Fun</i> since its release in August. Since then, he's embarked on the <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/JustinBieber/profile">Justin Bieber</a> Big tour with <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/Machinegunkelly/profile">Machine Gun Kelly</a> while slowly sharing visuals off of the album. Today, the rapper returned with the remix to one of the highlights of <i>So Much Fun</i>, "Hot." Thugger brought <a href="https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/TravisScott/profile/">Travis Scott</a> on board for the remix along with <a href="https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/tags/gunna/">Gunna</a>. The recently unleashed the fiery visuals for the remix. It's as outrageous as you'd expect any Thugger video to be. Gunna sits inside of a burning home as he pens his verse to his song, draped in high fashion before <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/youngthug/profile">Young Thug</a> and Slime Fire Department come to save him. Unfortunately, they don't survive but hey, atleast Travis Scott has a marching band with him!</p>
