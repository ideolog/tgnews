      <p>Following the announcement of yet another <i>Drag Race</i> spin-off, this time in the form of a celebrity edition, fans have even more Werk Room action to look forward to. However, the excitement doesn't end there, because former One Direction heartthrob <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/harry-styles-new-song-lights-up-is-out-you-need-to-listen-asap-19209387">Harry Styles said he'd consider joining <i>RuPaul's Celebrity Drag Race</i></a>, and I, along with his millions of adoring fans, am <i>very</i> much here for this.</p>
      <p>According to Digital Spy, the "Sign of the Times' singer was asked by Hits Radio if he'd ever consider putting himself forward to <a href="https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/reality-tv/a29664074/rupaul-celebrity-drag-race-cast-harry-styles/">appear in the upcoming U.S. spin-off</a>, and Styles appeared to be pretty keen on the idea when he enthusiastically replied, "potentially yeah! Why not?" Now, this is hardly confirmation, however the former-<i>X Factor</i> star would be a nice addition to the lineup of 12 celebrities, each of whom are set to battle it out for a chance to be crowned America's next celebrity drag superstar.</p>

In addition to competing for the all important crown, the celebrity drag-wannabes will also receive a cheque for a charity of their choice, and although the official celeb lineup is yet to be revealed, <i>Drag Race</i> superstars such as Alyssa Edwards, Bob the Drag Queen, Trixie Mattel, and many more have been <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B38EqQ4pzN3/">confirmed to appear as series mentors</a>.</p>
      <p>This latest addition to the RuPaul family arrives shortly after the debut of <i>Drag Race UK</i>, and as the <i>Radio Times</i> reports, 2020 is going to be another <a href="https://www.radiotimes.com/news/tv/2019-10-23/rupaul-celebrity-drag-race/">extremely busy year for the franchise</a>, with the arrival <i>Drag Race</i> season 12, <i>All Stars </i>season 5, and the recently announced <i>Drag Race Canada </i>— which is set to include <a href="https://twitter.com/Bhytes1/status/1177223253439537152">last year's U.S. runner-up Brooke Lynn Heights</a> as a permanent judge.</p>
      <p>So, if you can't get enough of the reality TV phenomenon, the arrival of <i>RuPaul's Celebrity Drag Race</i> will come as some <i>very </i>welcome news, and as we await the debut of this fabulous new spin-off, be sure to watch <i>Drag Race UK</i> on Thursdays at 8 p.m. on BBC Three.</p>
