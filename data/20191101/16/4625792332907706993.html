      <h1>7-year-old trick-or-treater critically injured by stray bullet in Chicago shooting</h1>

      <p>A 7-year-old <u><a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/ct-little-village-shooting-20191031-lka6hkboqja7nhgxrljnlzvbqu-story.html">trick-or-treater</a></u> was one of two people shot by a stray bullet in a Chicago gang shooting on Thursday night.</p>
      <p>The trick-or-treater, who was reported to be wearing either a bumblebee or Minnie Mouse costume, was hit by a stray bullet after members of rival gangs opened fire around 5:30 p.m. on Halloween. The girl was shot in the neck, leaving her in critical condition as of Friday morning.</p>
      <p>Authorities said the girl was trick-or-treating with a 31-year-old man. While the duo was walking, three men on the other side of the street got into an altercation and opened fire.</p>
      <p>Police claimed neither the girl nor the man with her was targets of the shooting, though both were hit with stray bullets.</p>
      <p>The man was hospitalized but listed in stable condition.</p>

      <p>In a press conference on Thursday night, Chicago Police Sgt. Rocco Alioto called the shooting “unacceptable.”</p>
      <p>"This was a 7-year-old girl that was trick-or-treating and happened to be shot because a group of guys wanted to shoot another male with a street full of kids trick-or-treating," he said.</p>
      <p>Chicago police Superintendent Eddie Johnson noted that the gunman has yet to be apprehended, despite an “overwhelming” number of tips from the community. Johnson explained that the gunman was wearing a “Jason” mask at the time of the shooting.</p>
      <p>He called the shooting “reprehensible,” and added that the gunmen “do not deserve to live in our city.”</p>
      <p>As Alioto noted, the street was crowded with trick-or-treaters. A <u>video</u> posted online after the shooting shows the chaos sparked by gunfire.</p>

      <p>One witness, Lali Lara, described the scene to the <i>Chicago Tribune</i>, saying, “The girl’s father was screaming, ‘My little girl’s been shot!’”</p>
      <p>“I was pressing on her and calling her name so she won’t close her eyes,’’ she said. ”She was looking at me, and I was calling her name. She was holding my hand for three minutes, and then she let me go. I have kids — I would go crazy if something happened to my kids."</p>
      <p>Police noted that one man had been questioned after being found wounded one block away from the shooting, but no arrests have been made.</p>
