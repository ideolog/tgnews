      <h1>Poll: Warren Leads in Iowa as Biden Sinks to Fourth</h1>
      <h2>Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is leading in Iowa, with Joe Biden (D) dropping to fourth place in what appears to be a tight race, a New York Times/Siena College poll released Friday <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/01/us/politics/iowa-poll-warren-biden.html">revealed</a>.</h2>

      <p>The<i> Times</i>/Siena poll, which surveyed 439 Iowa Democratic caucusgoers October 25-30, 2019, shows Warren leading the pack with 22 percent support. The race is tight, with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) coming in second place with 19 percent, Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) coming in third with 18 percent, and Biden dropping to fourth with 17 percent.</p>
      <p>No other candidate comes close to the top cluster. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) comes in 13 points behind Biden with four percent support, and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) and Andrew Yang (D) follow with three percent support each. The margin of error is +/- 4.7 percent.</p>
      <p>Even the<i> Times</i> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/01/us/politics/iowa-poll-warren-biden.html">describes</a> the poll’s findings as “full of alarming signs” for the former vice president, noting his lackluster performance in early primary and caucus states and adding his “comparatively weak position … presents a serious threat to his candidacy.”</p>
      <p>The results coincide with a Civiqs survey <a href="https://civiqs.com/documents/Civiqs_ISU_banner_book_2019_10.pdf">released</a> last week, which also showed Biden dropping to fourth place in the Hawkeye State.</p>
      <p>The Civiqs survey, taken October 18-22, 2019, among 598 likely Democratic Caucus attendees,  <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/10/24/iowa-poll-joe-biden-flops-fourth-place/">showed</a> Warren with 28 percent support, followed by Buttigieg, Sanders, and Biden with 20 percent, 18 percent, and 12 percent, respectively:</p>
