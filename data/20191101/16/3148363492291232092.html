      <h1>Detroit Police Chief: Concealed Carry 'Is About Staying Alive'</h1>
      <h2>Detroit Police Chief James Craig suggested concealed carry by law-abiding citizens “is about staying alive” during an October 30, 2019, interview on Tucker Carlson Tonight.</h2>

      <p>Craig, a vocal advocate of concealed carry for self-defense, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkkzasqfSfI&amp;app=desktop">said</a>, “There’s been research that shows criminals fear armed citizens more than they fear police.”</p>
      <p>He explained police are not ever-present, thus they usually arrive after a crime not during one: “By the time we’re called it’s usually after the fact, so we’re reacting to the crime.” But armed, law-abiding citizens can be present to act as the crime is unfolding.</p>
      <p>Craig added, “I’m not advocating [vigilantism], but I’m also advocating not becoming a victim. This is about staying alive.”</p>

      <p>On January 2, 2014, Breitbart News <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2014/01/03/detroit-police-chief-concealed-carry-deters-crime-saves-lives/">reported</a> Craig noting that “good community members who have concealed [licenses]” deter crime and save lives.</p>
      <p>On December 1, 2015, Breitbart News <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2015/12/01/detroit-police-chief-terrorists-want-unarmed-citizens-wont-give/">reported</a> Craig saying armed citizens also help fight the threat of terrorism. The  <a href="http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/detroit-city/2015/12/01/police-chief-says-armed-detroit-cut-terror-risk/76592116/">Detroit News</a> quoted Craig saying, “A lot of Detroiters have CPLs, and the same rules apply to terrorists as they do to some gun-toting thug. If you’re a terrorist, or a carjacker, you want unarmed citizens.”</p>
      <p>He suggested the knowledge that citizens  “would shoot back” probably makes “extremists…reluctant to target Detroit.”</p>
