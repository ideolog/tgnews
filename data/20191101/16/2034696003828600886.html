        <b>Netflix crime epic hits cinemas for a limited run on November 8</b>
      </p>
      <p>Robbie Robertson, former member of The Band, has detailed a new song he wrote for Martin Scorsese’s upcoming mob epic <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/movie/the-irishman-review-martin-scorsese-robert-de-niro"><i>The Irishman</i></a>.</p>
      <p>The 76-year-old musician wrote the entire score for the <a href="https://www.nme.com/tag/netflix">Netflix</a> production, but only ‘Theme for The Irishman’ makes it onto <i>The Irishman</i> soundtrack, set for release on November 8.</p>
      <p>Loaded with mournful harmonica fills and a doomy snaredrum beat, the track sounds like a classic Spaghetti Western song given a modern update.</p>

      <p>It sits alongside a selection of classic blues and ’50s pop tunes – as chosen by Scorsese’s usual music supervisor Randall Poster. The Five Satins’ doo-wop hit ‘In the Still of the Night’ makes an appearance, as does Fats Domino’s jazz-influenced ditty ‘The Fat Man’ and Glenn Miller’s ‘Tuxedo Junction’.</p>
      <p>“This is probably the 10th film I’ve worked on with Marty, and every time we do it, it’s a whole new experience,” Robertson told <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/robbie-robertson-martin-scorsese-the-irishman-soundtrack-906458/"><i>Rolling Stone</i></a>. “The music score for The Irishman was an unusual feat. We were trying to discover a sound, a mood, a feel, that could work, over the many decades that this story takes place. Marty was drawn to a theme I wrote that brought a unique, timeless quality to this movie.”</p>
