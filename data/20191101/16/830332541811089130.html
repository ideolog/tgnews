      <p>(CNN) - With cookie baking season around the corner, you may want to check your refrigerator first.</p>
      <p>Nestlé USA says it put out a voluntary recall after getting reports that customers found pieces of food-grade rubber pieces in some of their cookie dough products.</p>
      <p>The company said in a release that it had identified and fixed the problem, but issued the recall to be safe.</p>
      <p>The recall covers some easy-to-bake refrigerated Nestlé Toll House Cookie Dough bars, tubs and tubes sold in the United States and Puerto Rico, the company said <a href="https://www.nestleusa.com/media/pressreleases/allpressreleases/nestle-usa-announces-voluntary-recall-of-nestle-toll-house-and-mms-cookie-dough-products">in a release</a>.</p>
      <p>The recall is limited to the <a href="https://www.nestleusa.com/sites/g/files/pydnoa536/files/2019-10/Cookie-Dough-Recall-Full-Product-List.pdf">ready-to-bake refrigerated products</a> with batch codes that begin with 9189 through batch codes that begin with 9295. Batch dates are the four digits that follow the "use or freeze-by" date and before the number 5753.</p>
      <p>So far, no illnesses or injuries have been reported from the recalled products.</p>
      <p>If you have one of the items affected, the company said to throw it away, but keep your proof of purchase and contact Nestlé Consumer Services.</p>
