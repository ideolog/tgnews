      <h1>AppleTV+ debuts streaming TV service, here's how to subscribe and watch</h1>

      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T16:57:00+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 16:57</time> by <a rel="author">Agencies</a></address>
      <p>Apple TV+, the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/iphone">iPhone </a>maker's entry into the crowded streaming TV market, debuts on Friday as the first "all-original" subscription video service, according to <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/about/what-is-apple-inc">Apple Inc </a>Chief Executive Tim Cook.</p>
      <p>All of the programming is original because, unlike Netflix Inc and the forthcoming Disney+ from Walt Disney Co, Apple does not have rights to a back catalogue of TV shows and movies.</p>
      <p>That makes Apple's offering relatively slim compared to other online video services. It is also cheaper than competitors at Rs 99 ($4.99) per month after a seven-day free trial period.</p>
      <p>Anyone who has purchased an iPhone, iPad, Apple TV device, iPod touch or Mac after Sept. 10 can get a free subscription for one year.</p>
      <p>Launching in more than 100 countries and territories, Apple TV+ will debut with four TV series for adults, an episode of "Oprah's Book Club," a nature documentary, and three children's series. Additional programming will be added each month.</p>
      <p>TV shows that are available at launch include "See," "The Morning Show," "Dickinson," "For All Mankind," "Helpsters," "Snoopy in Space," "Ghostwriter," and Oprah Winfrey's Book Club. "The Elephant Queen," a documentary, is also available.</p>
      <p>
