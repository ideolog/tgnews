Another new feature is the ability to have HomePod play ambient sounds while you fall asleep, which we <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/10/29/how-to-use-homepod-ambient-sounds-white-noise-rain-fireplace/">recently went in-depth on how to use</a>. I just switched from Sonos to HomePod and haven’t looked back once.</p>
