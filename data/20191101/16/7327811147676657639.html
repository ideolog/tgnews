      <p>GAMBRILLS, MD -- A young boy's generous act of kindness while trick-or-treating will melt your heart.</p>
      <p>Leslie and Kevin Hodges live in Gambrills, Maryland. They set a bowl of candy outside their home for trick-or-treaters to enjoy.</p>
      <p>However, at some point during the night, the bowl went empty.</p>
      <p>Surveillance video shows a young boy walk up to the bowl. For a moment he seems sad that the bowl is empty, but then he realizes an even younger girl is approaching the house to trick-or-treat.</p>
      <p>He acts fast -- reaching into his own bag of candy, he pulls out a handful of sweets and puts them in the bowl to keep the approaching girl from missing out on the Halloween fun.</p>
      <p>"This has got to give hope to everyone that there are still amazing people in this world," Leslie Hodges wrote on Facebook. "What a selfless act from this little guy!"</p>
