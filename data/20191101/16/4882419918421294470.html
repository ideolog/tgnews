      <p>The divine treasure of youth. Ansu Fati has the world at his feet and he has only just turned 17. He celebrated his birthday on Oct. 31, the night of Halloween.</p>
      <p>The young Barcelona players, the second youngest to ever play for the club in La Liga and the youngest to score a league goal, celebrated in correspondence with his age. Well, maybe a little more luxuriously, than your usual teenage birthday, but he still managed to have a cake and the presence of his friends, many of them players for Barcelona's Juvenil A team (U19s).</p>
      <p>Without going further, a video uploaded onto Instagram by U19 full-back Adria Altimira shows the moment the cake was delivered to Ansu. As well as his teammates, there were many other people present, such as Rodrigo Messi (his agent), his parents, and various members of his family.</p>
      <p>The celebration took place at Nuba in Barcelona in the Sarria area. The party could not go on to late, though. For starters, Ansu and most of his friends are still not old enough to drink, and secondly he had training on Friday ahead of Saturday's game at Levante.</p>
