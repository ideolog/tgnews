      <p>Washington point guard Quade Green, who transferred from Kentucky last season, received approval from the NCAA that allows him to play immediately this season.</p>
      <p>The Huskies confirmed the news, which was first reported by Pete Thamel at Yahoo Sports.</p>
      <p>The 6-foot sophomore is expected to start when Washington opens the season Nov. 8 against Baylor in the Armed Forces Classic in Anchorage, Alaska.</p>
      <p>Green, a former five-star recruit, is the third McDonald’s All-American in a UW lineup that includes touted freshman forwards Isaiah Stewart and Jaden McDaniels, who starred in Thursday’s 87-63 exhibition win over Division II Western Washington.</p>
      <p>In nine games as a backup last season, Green averaged 8.0 points, 1.3 rebounds, 2.3 assists, 2.3 turnovers, 1.0 steals and 17.8 minutes.</p>
      <p>As a freshman in 2017-18, Green started 13 of 34 games last season when he averaged 9.3 points, 1.8 rebounds, 2.7 assists, 1.6 turnovers and 25.6 minutes.</p>
