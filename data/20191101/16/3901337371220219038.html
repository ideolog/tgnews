      <p>The Reds recorded a penalty shootout win over Arsenal in the Carabao Cup on Wednesday, on a night Gunners starlet Garbriel Martinelli scored a brace.</p>
      <p>The 18-year-old caused havoc behind the Liverpool defence, and was a particular thorn in the side of teenage defender Sepp van den Berg, prompting Klopp to lavish him with praise after the match.</p>

      <p>"Sepp van den Berg played an incredible game," the former Borussia Dortmund boss told Liverpool's official website.</p>
      <p>"That's really difficult to deal with these (Arsenal) guys. Martinelli is pretty much the same age (as Van den Berg) but he's a talent of the century, he's an incredible striker, so it's really difficult.</p>
      <p>"Then you have Mesut Ozil around and Willock right – who scored, by the way, a really nice one – so a team like Arsenal in a counter-attacking mood, we keep them deep, play around them, we lose the ball and then it's really difficult."</p>
