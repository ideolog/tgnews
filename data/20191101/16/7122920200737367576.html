      <h1>Here's a 'stache of Movember trends from Google Search</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T16:00:00+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 16:00</time> by <a rel="author">Salt E. Whiskers</a></address>
      <p>November is here, ushering in chilly weather, pumpkin-flavored everything, and 30 days of whiskers appearing on upper lips in support of men’s health causes. This four-week phase of facial fuzz is also known as Movember.</p>
      <p>We peeked at Google Images trends to see what types of cheek chops and mouth manes are capturing imaginations this year. Spoiler: there’s no wrong way to style your stubble.</p>
      <h3>The superior ‘stache</h3>
      <p>Few things are as dignifying as a masterful mustache. This year, gentlemen are gravitating toward the traditionally bushier upper lip adornments, and maintenance is top of mind. Search interest in <b>cowboy</b> and <b>cop</b> mustache styles--and <b>mustache wax</b> to keep them tidy--is up more than <b>5,000</b> percent since last year.</p>
      <p>Other ‘stache styles catching attention include the ultra-thin <b>pencil mustache</b>, which has seen more than a <b>5,000</b> percent growth in search interest, and the <b>horseshoe mustache</b> at <b>350</b> percent growth, for those who prefer their whiskers extend to their chin. The most inspirational mustache-havers this year are NFL players <b>Gardner Minshew</b> and <b>Aaron Rodgers</b> whose lip decor saw more than a <b>5,000</b> percent increase in search interest in the past 12 months.</p>
      <h3>Boss beards </h3>
      <p>When it comes to beards and other facial hair options, it’s a story in contrasts, with both super-groomed looks as well as longer, more exuberant styles on the rise. Search interest in the ultra-clean <b>faded</b> and <b>square</b> beard styles has doubled. The more prominent, historically-inspired <b>Viking</b> beard and mustache-plus-goatee <b>Van Dyck</b> look have also seen big leaps in the past year. </p>
      <p>But not everything is new—retro <b>sideburns</b> and the trusty <b>soul patch</b> have seen <b>190</b> percent and <b>110</b> percent more search interest on Google Images this year, respectively.</p>
      <h3>Facial fuzz in the US of A </h3>
      <p>Men nationwide are responding to the facial hair furor with a flurry of creativity. We looked at Google Search trends to see which beard, mustache and stubble styles were uniquely popular in each U.S. state, and it’s a wonder to behold. The <b>handlebar</b> mustache reigns supreme in six states across the country, and the <b>goatee</b> remains king in four. Here are a few others to call out (and if you wanted to see what all these styles look like, we have a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=facial+hair&amp;rlz=1CAVNXA_enUS865&amp;sxsrf=ACYBGNTjZCr2Jplbj-sQu5ijvyjSufiGNA:1572564016729&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjV9-e80cflAhXSPH0KHTLLBUgQ_AUIEigB&amp;biw=1200&amp;bih=633">solution</a> for that….):</p>
      <p><b>Arizona</b>: Circle beard <i>(</i><i>mustache plus rounded goatee combo)</i></p>
      <p><b>Colorado</b>: Braided beard <i>(one braids or two, it’s all up to you)</i></p>
      <p><b>Delaware</b>: Chinstrap beard <i>(a razor-thin beard that follows the jawline)</i></p>
      <p><b>Idaho</b>: Monkey tail beard <i>(asymmetrically shaved to look like a curling “tail”)</i></p>
      <p><b>New Jersey</b>: Huge beard <i>(as opposed to tiny)</i></p>
      <p><b>South Dakota</b>: Glitter beard <i>(start with gel, add glitter, and voila! A bedazzled beak)</i></p>
      <p><b>Virginia</b>: Beard dreads <i>(not just for the top of your head anymore)</i></p>
      <p><b>Washington, D.C.</b>: Chevron mustache <i>(the bushy-yet-perfectly-shaped classic)</i></p>
      <p><b>Washington</b>: 70’s mustache <i>(isn’t this redundant?)</i></p>
