      <p>Two people have been arrested in <a href="http://sputniknews.com/asia/20190821/1076600624.html">Hyderabad</a> for allegedly trying to bury a newborn girl in a pit after claiming she was dead. </p>
      <p>The men aroused the suspicion of a passing motorist who found them digging up the road near a bus stop while trying to hide their identity.</p>
      <blockquote>“An auto driver at the Jubilee bus stand ground noticed two people with a bag in their hands. They were digging the ground. The auto driver immediately reported the incident to the police,” a police officer told the media.</blockquote>
      <p>“Just as we were informed, we arrived at the location immediately and found that the bag these men were carrying, had a baby in it," he added.</p>
      <p>The incident was captured in a video showing policemen questioning the two men.</p>

      <p>The man claimed the baby was their granddaughter who had died during surgery. They said the baby would not be allowed on public transport so they decided to bury her.</p>
      <p>But the police found the <a href="http://sputniknews.com/us/20190914/1076800869.html">baby-girl</a> was alive. They took her to hospital and arrested both the men.</p>
