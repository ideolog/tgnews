      <p>FLORENCE TOWNSHIP, New Jersey -- A mother and her young daughter were rushed to the hospital after police say they were struck by a vehicle while trick-or-treating on Thursday night in Burlington County, New Jersey.</p>
      <p>Police say a driver struck the 33-year-old mother and her 3-year-old daughter. Witnesses say the two were crossing the street, the little one in a costume, as they were out trick-or-treating.</p>
      <p>"I just heard the hollering, the kids screaming," said neighbor Tammy Hickman.</p>
      <p>She says she saw kids coming her way for candy. The next thing she knew she heard was those screams.</p>
      <p>"I came outside and I heard hollering, and the gentleman that hit the kids came over and sat down in front of me," Hickman said. "He was crying and said, 'I didn't see them. I didn't see them.' I put my hand on his back and told him to calm down."</p>
      <p>Both victims were flown to an area hospital. They are listed in critical condition at this time.</p>
      <p>Police say the driver stayed at the scene.</p>
