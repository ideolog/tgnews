      <h1>Cam Newton is 'a long way off' from playing, will see specialist about foot injury</h1>

      <p>The Panthers had hoped to get Cam Newton back at some point this season, but the foot injury he suffered in Week 2 is preventing that from happening.</p>
      <p>Even though he’s been on top of his rehab, Newton’s foot simply hasn’t improved enough to make a return possible, and the star quarterback has now gone out in search of answers. According to ESPN’s Josina Anderson, Newton boarded a plane to Green Bay on Friday to visit a foot specialist.</p>

      <p>As NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport explained, Newton is “a long way off” from playing football.</p>

      <p>Despite not having Newton, the Panthers have managed to go 4-1 with Kyle Allen under center. However, Allen had his worst game of the season in a loss to the San Francisco 49ers last Sunday, which didn’t help put the team’s mind at ease about possibly having to go the rest of the season without Newton.</p>
      <p>While Allen has been solid, the Panthers would obviously prefer to have Newton so long as he’s healthy. We’ll see if the foot specialist can find a way to get him back on the field soon, but right now, it’s not looking too good for Newton.</p>
