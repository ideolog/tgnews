      <p>BHUBANESWAR: Talks of a tennis-match scoreline were thwarted and India coach <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Graham-Reid">Graham Reid</a>'s words "Russia can play hockey" turned into a prophecy of sorts on Friday, when the hosts left it a little too late for comfort before winning 4-2 in their first match of the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Olympic-qualifiers">Olympic qualifiers</a> here at the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Kalinga-Stadium">Kalinga Stadium</a>.</p>

      <p>When Andrey Kuraev nullified <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Harmanpreet-Singh">Harmanpreet Singh</a>'s fifth-minute penalty-stroke conversion with a field goal, the crowd -- some 10,000 of them -- was silenced by the red brigade.</p>
      <p>By the end of a goal-less third quarter, it was the first (24th minute) of <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Mandeep-Singh">Mandeep Singh</a>'s two goals that separated the two teams at 2-1. It would have been a nervous margin to win with, going into Saturday's second and final match.</p>
      <p>It was only in the final 15 minutes that India added some cushioning, with veteran SV Sunil in the 48th minute and Mandeep in the 53rd coming to their team's rescue.</p>
      <p>4-1 looked a lot better than 2-1, but Russia decided to not let India sleep easy and scored again, off a penalty corner, through Semen Matkovskiy in the final minute.</p>
      <p>On both occasions when India conceded, Krishan Pathak was the goalkeeper as India continued with their practice of swapping goalkeepers in each quarter. Coach Reid might have to take another look at that strategy with India just two goals ahead of the Russians and a game to play.</p>
      <p>The other worrying factor is the goal-less five penalty corners, with neither Harmanpreet Singh nor <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Rupinder-Pal-Singh">Rupinder Pal Singh</a> managing to breach the Russian post. The visitors converted one of the four penalty corners they earned.</p>
      <p>Reid admitted that India's PC battery didn't fire as expected but sounded confident that they will bounce back.</p>
      <p>"Penalty corners is always one of those things (where) we love to score more," said the India coach after the match.</p>
      <p>"During our last tour (Belgium), we had scored 0 from 7 penalty corners in the first game and then had 100 percent (conversion) in the next four games. Part of the problem always is the sections to the penalty corner (injection, stopping and flick). We mis-trapped two today. We need to make sure that doesn't happen again."</p>
      <p>From the outset on Friday, the fluidity in India's midfield was missing. There weren't enough balls played to the midfield and relayed to the flanks from there to put the Russians under pressure.</p>
      <p>Captain Manpreet, who is the leader of India's playmakers, would want to sit down and see where the connection went missing.</p>
      <p>"I was disappointed with the way our boys played. I have spoken to them about that. We needed to get the ball into the midfield today. We did not get enough play thrugh the midfield. It gets very difficult to get flow when those connections are missing," Reid analysed.</p>
      <p>Overall, India lacked the intensity that Reid has always wanted to extract out of the boys. Be it being more assertive in the opening quarter or keeping error-free possession in the dying minutes, India couldn't tick the boxes they would have liked.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, Russia surprised the Indian defence with their pace, which evidently unsettled India's midfield as well as the defence.</p>
      <p>"The reason why we played so good is that our guys did exactly what we told them to do," said Russia's coach Vladimir Konkin. "That's why we had a good result compared to our last game (0-10 Vs India). Actually we had a lot of opportunities for our forwards but we missed it."</p>
