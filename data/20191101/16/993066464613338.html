      <p>A MAN accused of storing swords, axes and knives with explosives and ammunition at his home built a collection due to an interest in The Lord of the Rings and Gladiator movies, the High Court has heard.</p>
      <p>Robert Templeton (33) also claimed chemicals found alongside industrial quantities of sugar and suspected pipe bomb component parts were because of his enthusiasm for making rockets and pyrotechnics.</p>
      <p>Together with his 31-year-old classroom assistant wife Natasha, he faces charges connected to the seizure of around 130 items from their Cladytown Road property in Glarryford, near Ballymena on July 5.</p>
      <p>Despite previous reports that the couple were allegedly stockpiling food for an "end times" scenario, a judge was told Templeton is believed to have hoarded goods legitimately purchased online.</p>
      <p>Based on a report from a consultant psychiatrist, prosecution counsel Kate McKay described the defendant's behaviour as "eccentric".</p>
      <p>Templeton was granted bail on conditions including a ban on acquiring anything over the internet.</p>
      <p>He is charged with offences including possessing explosives in suspicious circumstances and with intent to endanger life, possessing ammunition with intent, having documents useful to terrorism, and preparation of terrorist acts.</p>
      <p>Alleged component parts for multiple Improvised Explosive Devices, chemicals including ammonium nitrate, and ball-bearings were found during searches at his home.</p>
      <p>Quantities of 9mm ammunition, shotgun cartridges, a machine gun barrel, swords, knives, axes, knuckle dusters, a crossbow and a large number of power tools were also seized.</p>
      <p>Mrs McKay said police found a publication called the US Army Improvised Munitions Handbook.</p>
      <p>A previous court was told Natasha Templeton - who is already on bail - denied knowing the contents of any of the packages bought online.</p>
      <p>During interviews her husband claimed many of the items were ordered but never opened, while others had been purchased from a shop in Belfast.</p>
      <p>"He said the swords found were part of a collection and that he was interested in films using swords, for example The Lord of the Rings and Gladiator," Mrs McKay submitted.</p>
      <p>Defence counsel argued that Templeton bought goods from eBay and other legal sites, rather than going onto the dark web.</p>
