      <h1>LeBron James completely transforms into Edward Scissorhands for his Halloween costume</h1>

      <p>LeBron James has pulled off yet another epic Halloween costume — this time taking it to another level as Edward Scissorhands. The Los Angeles Lakers superstar shared photos of his convincing disguise on social media Thursday.</p>
      <p>James, who last year dressed up as a spooky version of the clown "It," stayed with the fiction theme and picked one of Johnny Depp's most recognizable characters. The 34-year-old "Space Jam 2" actor called himself, "LeDward Scissorhands."</p>

      <p>"Happy Halloween beautiful people," he wrote in the photo caption. He also took more pictures with "Sedusa" — his wife Savanah, who wore a Medusa costume.</p>
      <p>James wasn't the only star athlete going all-out for Halloween. Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson and his wife Ciara dressed up as hip-hop royalty, posing as Jay Z and Beyoncé.</p>
