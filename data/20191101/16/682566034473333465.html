      <p>Madrid - <b>Zinedine Zidane</b> said on Friday <b>Gareth Bale</b> has resumed light training but will not be available for Real Madrid's La Liga game at home to Real Betis.</p>
      <p>Madrid can register their third consecutive victory by beating struggling Betis on Saturday but Bale remains on the sidelines, as he continues his recovery from a calf problem.</p>
      <p>Bale caused a stir this week by taking the day off on Monday to meet his agent in London, prompting reports in Spain he was discussing a move away from the Santiago Bernabeu in January.</p>
      <p>But Zidane has insisted Bale had permission to be absent from the club and he is now back in training.</p>
      <p>The Welshman was not with the rest of the squad for Friday's early session but did some running alone with a team physio.</p>
      <p>"He is here with us, he is training and working hard," said Zidane in a press conference on Friday.</p>
      <p>"He is back from his trip and he is getting better. He is not available yet but he is recovering bit by bit.</p>
      <p>"It seems we should bring him out here to speak to you because I don't know anything more."</p>
      <p>Real Madrid sit second in La Liga, a point behind Barcelona and one ahead of Atletico Madrid and surprise high-fliers Granada, both of whom have played a game more.</p>
      <p>James Rodriguez returned to Madrid on Friday from Colombia after the birth of his second child, but he is not expected to be involved this weekend.</p>
      <p>Centre-back Nacho is struggling with a knee problem and Marco Asensio is a long-term absentee with a cruciate ligament injury.</p>
