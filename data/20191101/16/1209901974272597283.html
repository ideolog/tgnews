      <p>The Heartland Youth Center held their Haunted House on Friday, Oct. 25th – they had 220 brave guests attend!</p>
      <p>The Haunted House is a project put on by the HYC teens involved in the Torch Club (12 – 14 years) and the Keystone Club (14 – 18 years), said Winnie Bissett, executive director of the Heartland Youth Center.</p>
      <p>“Although it is also a fundraiser for the two groups, the most important aspect of the Haunted House is the personal and group skill development – the teens learn how to work together, share and compromise on ideas, take leadership roles, and of course commitment is needed as it takes a few weeks to put the Haunted House together!”</p>
