      <h1>Boris Johnson launches general election campaign without a seatbelt in £300k Jag</h1>
      <h2>Road safety charity Brake urged the PM to buckle up after his ill-judged handheld video - though he may have a get-out against claims he broke the law</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T16:14:43+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 16:14</time> by <a rel="author">Ben Glaze, Dan Bloom, https://www.facebook.com/MirrorPolitics, https://www.facebook.com/mirrordanbloom</a></address>
      <p>Boris Johnson launched the Tories’ election campaign with a video of him inside his chauffeur-driven Jaguar in a blue-light convoy.</p>
      <p>The 61-second film was shot in the back of his bomb-proof XJL Sentinel as it sped through London’s darkened streets with traffic held back by his police motorcycle outriders.</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister is shown with his arms folded, sunk into the heated, cushioned, black leather massage seat of the £300,000 luxury motor - without wearing a seat belt - as his security bubble insulates him from the public.</p>
      <p>The gas guzzling, five-litre, supercharged limousine glides him through the capital as a lackey films the bizarre mini-movie.</p>
      <p>The lack of a seatbelt led to claims he should strap in to set an example.</p>
      <p>Asked about the case, Joshua Harris of Brake, the road safety charity, said: “Seat belts have been proven to be the most effective way of keeping yourself safe in a crash.</p>
      <p>"So we urge all drivers and passengers to always buckle up, regardless of the individual or the situation."</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>It is against the law not to wear a seatbelt and those caught can be fined £100 - rising to £500 if the case ends up in court.</p>
      <p>But <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> may have a get out from claims he broke the law - because there is an exemption for “a vehicle being used for police, fire and rescue services”.</p>
      <p>His limo is driven by a highly-skilled Met Police officer and uses blue lights.</p>
      <p>Brake is campaigning for the law to be toughened up with penalty points on the licence of those who do not buckle up. “Tragically nearly four people a week needlessly die on our roads when not belted up," Mr Harris said.</p>
      <p>One <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> user even copied in the Metropolitan Police about the PM - once branded "not the man you want driving you home" by Amber Rudd. No10 declined to comment.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile the choice of a protected convoy for his video, hours after <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/angry-medical-student-slams-boris-20765714">he was confronted by a medical student at a hospital,</a> led to mockery of the Tory leader from his enemies being out of touch.</p>
      <p>One Labour activist said on Twitter: "He says from the comfort of his 350k bulletproof jag with at least another 40k spent on security today at Addenbrooks."</p>
      <p>Guardian columnist Rafael Behr joked: "The PM appears to be launching his election bid literally from the back of a chauffeur-driven car. Is it possible they are not actually very good at this?"</p>
      <p>In the video, Boris Johnson tries to blame <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> for stalling progress of his <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a> deal in Parliament.</p>
      <p>He claims he can get an "oven-ready" deal swiftly through the House of Commons if he is returned with a majority on December 12.</p>

      <p>The film was recorded hours after <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a> railed against elites as he kicked off Labour’s fight for power.</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn said: “The Prime Minister wants you to believe that we’re having this election because Brexit is being blocked by an establishment elite.</p>
      <p>“People aren’t fooled so easily - they know the Conservatives are the establishment elite.</p>
      <p>“And you know what really scares the elite? All of us, the British people.</p>
