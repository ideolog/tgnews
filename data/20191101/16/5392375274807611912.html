      <p>Apple is Losing Pricing Power: iPhone Average Selling Price is Too Low<br/>3.5 (69.05%) 42 votes</p>
      <p>Today, Barclays said that maybe Apple is losing its strong pricing power. In order to expand the user base of the service business, Apple began selling the iPhone at a lower price. Tim Long, Barclays IT hardware analyst, said in a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/31/only-one-major-analyst-was-not-impressed-by-apples-results-and-heres-what-has-him-worried.html">report</a> to clients on Thursday: ‘iPhone revenues were in-line, but we believe the iPhone average selling price was weaker.’</p>

      <p>Despite the decline in iPhone sales, Apple reported third-quarter earnings and revenues better than expected. Moreover, its share price rose by more than 1%. The tech giant, led by Tim Cook, reported earnings per share of $3.03 and revenue of $64 billion. Wall Street has been expecting earnings per share of $2.48 and a revenue of $62.99 billion. Apple’s performance has benefited from a strong demand for iPad and AirPods and the growth of Apple’s services business.</p>

      <p>The iPhone’s revenue was $33.36 billion, slightly higher than the $32.42 billion estimates. But Lang said that the average iPhone price of the iPhone will fall 10% in the fourth quarter. The company currently expects the average selling price to fall by 12% in 2019. At the same time, it should fall by 6.5% next year.</p>
      <p>Apple released three new iPhones in September: iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, and iPhone 11 Pro Max. The iPhone 11 starts at $699 and is $50 cheaper than last year’s iPhone XR. Lower prices are expected to attract a wider range of customers for Apple’s service business.</p>
      <p>Barclays gave a shareholding rating on the stock and raised Apple’s target price slightly to $236 per share, lower than Apple’s $243.26 per share on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Some analysts are optimistic about the prospects of the new 5G iPhone that will be released next year. But Lang believes that Apple will not be able to set a high enough price without damaging demand.</p>
      <p>He pointed out that the lower price trend ‘may present challenges for 5G, which we believe will carry at least $150 higher ASP.’</p>
