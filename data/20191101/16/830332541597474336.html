      <p>(CNN) - Americans are split along party lines on whether to impeach and remove President Donald Trump, according to a Washington Post/ABC News <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/americans-sharply-divided-over-whether-to-impeach-and-remove-trump-from-office-post-abc-poll-finds/2019/10/31/b0562312-fc04-11e9-ac8c-8eced29ca6ef_story.html">poll</a> released Friday.</p>
      <p>Coming on the heels of the House's <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/31/politics/house-impeachment-inquiry-resolution-floor-vote/index.html">approval vote on Thursday</a> formalizing the procedures of the impeachment inquiry into Trump and after weeks of testimony from current and former administration officials behind closed doors, the poll shows results nearly identical to a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/22/politics/cnn-impeachment-poll-trump-ukraine/index.html">recent CNN poll</a> released last week that half of Americans support removing the President -- suggesting that levels of impeachment support have remained steady as the inquiry ramps up.</p>
      <p>In Friday's poll, 49% of Americans indicated that Trump should be impeached and removed from office, while 47% indicated that he should not be as the House's impeachment inquiry into Trump's dealings with Ukraine head into its next phase.</p>
      <p>The poll finds a wide partisan gap on impeachment and removal. Eighty-two percent of Democrats support removing the President from office, while 13% are against it. Meanwhile, 18% of Republicans back removing Trump, while 82% oppose it. Independents, though, are split -- with 47% backing impeachment and 49% against it.</p>
      <p>Regardless of their views on impeachment, 55% say Trump did something wrong in his dealings with Ukraine, and 60% say it was inappropriate for Trump to involve his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani in his dealings with Ukraine.</p>
      <p>Thirty-eight percent of Americans overall approve of Trump's job as president, while 58% disapprove -- and 48% strongly disapprove, according to the newly released poll. Trump's disapproval rating stands at 91% among Democrats, 57% among independents and -- in a record low among Post-ABC polls, the paper reported -- 74% among Republicans.</p>
      <p>The poll released Friday was conducted over the telephone from Sunday to Wednesday among a random national sample of 1,003 adults. Sixty-five percent of participants were reached on cellphones and 35% were reached on landlines. The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.</p>
