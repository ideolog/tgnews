      <p>A community-based project is doing more than welcoming migrants and asylum seekers to Ireland, it is helping them to improve their command of the English language.</p>
      <p>Fáilte Isteach is a national programme of Third Age, a not-for-profit organisation working for social inclusion across all groups and ages in Ireland, and is run in partnership with other community groups.</p>
      <p>There are 132 branches in every county in Ireland where 1,100 trained tutors, mostly older volunteers, provide weekly English classes to more than 3,800 migrants from 90 different countries.</p>
      <p>During the current academic year, more than 72,000 hours of tuition will be provided by Fáilte Isteach that has provided a model for similar classes in Germany and Italy.</p>
      <p>Fáilte Isteach works with Syrian refugees and is currently providing tuition to migrants in six direct provision centres across Ireland.</p>
      <p>The programme, established in 2006, was launched nationally in 2008 following a successful pilot project in Summerhill, Co Meath, involving 12 volunteer tutors and seven students.</p>
      <p>Chief executive of Third Age, Aine Brady, said dozens of voluntary and community groups were working quietly away to support migrants in the most practical way possible.</p>

      <p>“People talk about the need for migrants to learn the English language and to foster understanding, connection and integration at a local level. This is already happening, and Fáilte Isteach is proof of it,” she said.</p>
      <blockquote>Since the start of the new academic year, we have been visiting our branches, welcoming new people onto our courses and supporting out volunteers with new materials and online lessons.</blockquote>

      <p>Migrants attend the free conversational English classes to improve their language skills and to get help with form filling, writing curriculum vitae and drafting letters to increase their employment opportunities.</p>
      <p>They also get help on managing day-to-day tasks such as shopping, banking and generally interacting with the community.</p>
