      <h1>E-tolls have no future in Gauteng, Ekurhuleni's mayor reiterates</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T16:48:00+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 16:48</time> by <a rel="author">Sesona Ngqakamba</a></address>
      <p>City of Ekurhuleni Mayor Mzwandile Masina has reiterated his stance that e-tolls have no future in Gauteng.</p>
      <p>Masina was speaking at the centre council chambers in Alberton, Johannesburg, on Friday where Gauteng Premier David Makhura met with all mayors in the province to strengthen inter-governmental relations and co-operative governance.</p>
      <p>The mayor said he appreciated that President Cyril Ramaphosa directed Minister of Transport Fikile Mbalula and Finance Minister Tito Mboweni, as well as Makhura, to come up with a solution.</p>
      <p>"We have said it as residences, that e-tolls have no future in Gauteng. We would like them to sit down and engage and come up with a solution that will assist all of us because it is hitting us very hard as citizens," he said.</p>
      <p>Masina added that it was also important to note that voters said they were not prepared to pay for the tolls.</p>

      <p>During Mboweni's medium-term budget speech in Parliament on Wednesday, he said Cabinet considered several options to resolve the impasse on e-tolls.</p>
      <p>"Not paying your e-tolls is not an option. We have to ensure that we honour our obligations. I urge the nation to pay for bills for services rendered," he added</p>
      <p>Masina, however, said that at political party level, the ANC has been able to come with options which he believed would form part of solutions regarding e-tolls, which the leadership needs to look into before taking any conclusion regarding the pressing issue.</p>
      <p>In a briefing regarding the issue on Thursday afternoon, Mbalula said he has been tasked by Cabinet to consider a few options before reporting back in two weeks, where a decision will be taken, <a href="https://www.fin24.com/Budget/cabinet-will-be-ready-to-make-a-decision-on-e-tolls-in-2-weeks-mbalula-20191031-2">Fin24 reported</a>.</p>
