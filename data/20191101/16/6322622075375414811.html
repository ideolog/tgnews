      <p>PUTRAJAYA (Nov 1): The Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) has urged media practitioners to report on corrupt practices with the responsibility of educating the public on the dangers of corruption to the country.</p>
      <p>MACC Chief Commissioner Latheefa Koya said the media should report the facts behind every corruption issue in an impartial manner.</p>
      <p>"Media practitioners should not be easily influenced by stakeholders on any issue.</p>
      <p>"Media practitioners must be able to identify the parties that make use of the media for their own benefit, and not for the development of the nation.</p>
      <p>"For example, those who use the issue of corruption to gain certain positions, and who use it as a weapon to bring down another party for their own interests," she said at the 2019 Media Appreciation Night hosted by the agency here today.</p>
      <p>Also present were MACC Deputy Chief Commissioner (Operations) Datuk Seri Azam Baki, Malaysian National News Agency (Bernama) chairman Datuk Seri Azman Ujang, as well as editors-in-chief and media practitioners from various organisations.</p>
      <p>Latheefa said although every media organisation had its own set of agenda, all media practitioners should be united and transparent on the issue of corruption.</p>
      <p>"There should be no opportunity or space for crime to poison and ruin our country's development," she said.</p>
      <p>She added that the media was one of the most important components of community development for a developing country like Malaysia.</p>
      <p>"The media plays a major role in bringing social awareness to matters based on issues of interest, welfare and social justice as a whole.</p>
      <p>"That is why the job of a journalist is not just to report the news, the report must have a 'soul' that is responsible for raising awareness and educating the public on any issue or social problem, including corruption," she said.</p>
      <p>Latheefa said the media should also assist the MACC in their investigation by not reporting on a case while it was under investigation, as it could affect the process.</p>
      <p>She said the commitment shown by media practitioners indirectly encouraged the MACC to continue to carry out its duties and responsibilities in the fight against corruption and abuse of power.</p>
      <p>"Personally, I am very impressed with this close relationship and this cooperation, it is my hope that this good relationship between us lasts for long," she said.</p>
