      <p><b>WARWICK, R.I.Â (AP)</b> - A campaign aide to the state House speaker pleaded not guilty on Friday to charges of money laundering and making a prohibited campaign contribution.</p>
      <p>Jeff Britt's attorney entered not guilty pleas on his behalf during a brief arraignment in Superior Court in Warwick, according to The Providence Journal .</p>
      <p>Authorities allege Britt funded a $1,000 contribution made through a third party to defeated Republican primary candidate Shawna Lawton, for a mailer endorsing Democratic House Speaker Nicholas Mattiello instead of her party's nominee in 2016.</p>
      <p>Britt, 51, was released on $10,000 personal recognizance and told he'd be excused from some future court appearances since he lives in Palm Beach, Florida. He referred reporters' questions to his attorney, Robert Corrente. Corrente, a former U.S. attorney, said Britt was used by the Mattiello campaign as a "fall guy."</p>
      <p>Mattiello, who exited the courthouse moments later, told reporters, "I know nothing about it." Mattiello, an attorney, said he was at the courthouse for work.</p>
      <p>Mattiello beat Republican opponent Steven Frias by just 85 votes in his Cranston district in 2016. The state Republican Party filed a complaint over the mailer, alleging Lawton didn't properly disclose who funded it and claiming Lawton and Mattiello illegally coordinated through Britt.</p>
      <p>The elections board dismissed contempt proceedings against Britt last year but referred the case to the attorney general.</p>
      <p>According to the indictment, Lawton deposited the $1,000 check into her campaign account, along with another $1,000 check delivered by Britt, then gave Britt a check for $2,150 that was used to pay for the mailer.</p>
      <p>The money laundering charge is a felony, while making a prohibited campaign contribution is a misdemeanor.</p>
