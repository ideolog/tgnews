      <p>A 12-year-old girl hit by a car while trick or treating was saved by six heroic women who lifted the vehicle off her.</p>
      <p>The girl was dragged down the road after being hit by the car that had been shot at in what is believed to be a targeted attack.</p>
      <p>She was left with bleeds on the brain, a fractured skull and burns to her back in the horrific incident that occurred at around 8pm on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The driver, who left the vehicle covered in blood, waited by the roadside until the girl's family arrived.</p>
      <p>Witnesses told how six women, including the girl's auntie, helped lift the car and free the injured youngster trapped underneath.</p>
      <p>The St John Boscoe pupil was struck by a black VW Golf as she was out enjoying Halloween night with a friend, on Sceptre Road in Croxteth.</p>
      <p>Today, the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/six-heroic-women-lift-car-17184209">Liverpool ECHO</a> spoke with the girl's family, who live just a three-minute walk from where the hit-and-run took place.</p>

      <p>The girl, who has not been named, was in the nearby Croxteth Gems youth club with her aunt when she nipped out to go trick or treating.</p>
      <p>The Golf was shot at a number of times at around 7.45pm before the vehicle suddenly reversed to try and escape, but knocked down the child in the process.</p>
      <p>This morning, her stunned relatives said she was talking in bed at Alder Hey Hospital, and was likely to be "on the mend."</p>
      <p>But she is still seriously injured with a skull fracture, three brain bleeds, and "road burn" injuries where her small body was dragged under the car.</p>
      <p>She may need skin grafts and has been undergoing X-rays.</p>
      <p>Locals described how up to six heroic women managed to pick up the Golf and haul it off the stricken girl.</p>
      <p>Her gran, who she lives with, said: "I was in work at the time.</p>
      <p>"She was with her auntie at the Croxteth Gems where there was a Halloween party with loads of kids.</p>
      <p>"Then a young lad came running in and told his auntie that she'd been run over and hurt.</p>
      <p>"We're told she's been talking in hospital and will be on the mend, so that's good news.</p>
      <p>"We've been so worried."</p>
      <p>The girl was sick in the back of the ambulance due to the shock of the collision.</p>
      <p>Witnesses said it sounded like there were up to three shots fired before people heard a car's tyres screeching as it attempted to flee the busy scene.</p>

      <p>Onlookers said the sound of children screaming could clearly be heard.</p>
      <p>A cordon is currently in place on Sceptre Road with the black VW Golf visible in the middle.</p>
      <p>It has a green tarpaulin sheet covering it.</p>
      <p>White suited forensic officers are combing the i</p>
      <p>mmediate vicinity looking for bullet casings or any other clues to build up a picture of what happened.</p>
      <p>Police have yet to make an arrest in connection with the incident but a spokesperson confirmed that the 22 year-old-man, thought to be the driver of the vehicle, has been questioned in hospital.</p>
      <p>The force said the firearm involved was a shotgun and that investigation is underway to piece together the exact sequence of events that occurred.</p>
      <p>They also confirmed that the vehicle did stop after it hit the girl before her family and members of the public rushed to her aid.</p>
      <p>Police also confirmed that they have seized a second vehicle, a Ford Kuga, on Blackwater Road as part of investigations into the incident.</p>
      <p>Some residents close the scene told the ECHO that they were aware of the identities of the people involved in the shooting.</p>
      <p>Assistant Chief Constable Ian Critchley said there is a "significant uniform presence" in the area to reassure the public and that police are encouraging anyone with further information to contact police.</p>
      <p>He told the ECHO: "We are dealing with a very cowardly violent firearm discharge that led to a serious injury.</p>
      <p>"One to a 22-year-old man who was shot in the face and received significant facial and eye injuries but also to an innocent 12 year-old girl who was playing with her friends having fun on Halloween when she was caught up in the consequences of a discharge and was violently struck by the car.</p>
      <p>"The courageous actions of people at the scene are at odds with the cowardly actions of an individual who has discharged a weapon at a possible intended target with no regard to life or anybody else. It has left a 12 year old lying in hospital.</p>

      <p> "This should never, never be happening."</p>
      <p>Mayor Joe Anderson said: "I saw someone on social media suggest she was in the wrong place at the wrong time.</p>
      <p>"That is completely untrue, she was in the place she should have been, in her community, enjoying Halloween with her friends and family.</p>
      <p>"It is that community that is now in the wrong place if it knows something about who is involved with this and is not telling the police.</p>
      <p>"Like with what happened to Rhys, the police and authorities cannot do this alone - we need people to come forward and help bring these people down.</p>
      <p>"And if you don't, then more innocent people and children will be the victims of these crimes - because there will be more reprisals."</p>
      <p>An emotional Mayor Anderson added: "My grandchildren were out trick or treating last night - I can only imagine what the family of this young girl are going through.</p>
      <p>"My thoughts are also with Melanie and Steve Jones (Rhys Jones' parents) as this incident must have brought home awful memories for them."</p>
      <p>Police put a Section 60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 in place on Friday night, which allows a police officer to stop and search a person without suspicion.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for Merseyside Police said last night: “An investigation is underway following reports a male and a female were injured in Croxteth this evening, Thursday 31st October.</p>
      <p>“We were called at 7.50pm following reports that shots had been fired at a black VW Golf as it travelled along Sceptre Road. A short time later the car was in collision with a 12 year-old female pedestrian.</p>

      <p>“Shortly after the incident a male presented at hospital with a facial injury. The injury is not believed to be life threatening.</p>
      <p>“The female pedestrian has also been taken to hospital for treatment for her injuries.</p>
      <p>“Her injuries are described as serious but not life threatening.”</p>
      <p>Chief Inspector Mark Everard said: “This investigation is in its very early stages and enquiries are being carried out to establish exactly what has taken place.</p>
      <p>“I would appeal to anyone who was in the vicinity of Sceptre Road this evening who saw anyone or anything suspicious or captured anything on dash-cam footage to contact us as they may be able to assist with the investigation.</p>
      <p>“Firearms have no place on the streets of Merseyside and we are committed to finding the people responsible for using them and bringing them to justice.”</p>
      <p>He added: "This is an extremely worrying incident, where the offender/s have shown no thought for the general public and has resulted in an innocent young girl, who was out enjoying herself, experiencing this traumatic ordeal."</p>
      <p>Anyone with information is asked to DM @MerPol, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 quoting log 977 of 31st October.</p>
