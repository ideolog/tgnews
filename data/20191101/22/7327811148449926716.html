      <p>NEW YORK CITY (WABC) -- "The New York City Marathon is one of the best days of my life," says celebrity chef Daniel Humm.</p>
      <p>As Humm dashes through Central Park, his appetite for the marathon, stirred up by discipline and a heap of teamwork, is the flavor of his success.</p>
      <p>"Everyone here wants to achieve something special, all together," he says.</p>
      <p>Running world-class restaurants from sun up to sun down, how would restaurant workers even get in a training run?</p>
      <p>That's no problem in the city that never sleeps.</p>
      <p>Outside Eleven Madison Park, one of the tastiest restaurants on the planet, the staff is off the clock at midnight on a recent night - and they're out to meet coach John Honerkamp.</p>
      <p>"The level of hospitality is so high that they are busy focusing on taking care of everybody else," Honerkamp says..</p>
      <p>Team "Make It Nice" started in 2017 as a way to fit in fitness, despite demands, indulgent foods, and bizarre hours.</p>
      <p>And they show up!</p>
      <p>Some had never even run a race. Now, Macheo is an ultra marathoner!</p>
      <p>Chef Maddie Sperling describes cooking at Nomad as a nonstop sprint.</p>
      <p>"Being a line cook in a New York City restaurant, you are literally running every day for 10-12 hours," she says.</p>
      <p>She hit her stride with the team and is now ready for her first NYC marathon.</p>
      <p>"I'm so excited!" she says.</p>
      <p>And then there's the Chung family, Zack and Connie. He ran last year. She's running this year!</p>
      <p>Made Nice supervisor Tony Haber walked, biked and jogged to lose more than 80lbs, just to be fit enough to run with the team.</p>
      <p>"My top weight was 325 pounds," he says, "and I'm down to 245. To not huff and puff through the kitchen is a confidence boost!"</p>
      <p>So it turns out adding one more thing to their plate is actually pushing all these chefs to be even better!</p>
