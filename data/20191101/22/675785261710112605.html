      <h1>Unai Emery explains his reasons behind leaving Granit Xhaka out of Wolves clash</h1>
      <h2>Granit Xhaka told Arsenal fans to "f*** off" following the reaction to his substitution against Crystal Palace last weekend</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T22:30:00+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">Mike Walters, https://www.facebook.com/Mike-Walters-Mirror</a></address>
      <p>Granit Xhaka has been spared the ordeal of facing another Emirates shooting gallery – because his head is still spinning from <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> fans' abuse.</p>
      <p>Despite training as usual with the Gunners' first-team squad, Xhaka will miss Saturday's home game with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> to ride out the storm which engulfed him last weekend.</p>
      <p>Manager Unai Emery confirmed his captain will absent, saying: “It is not in my mind that he is playing tomorrow.”</p>
      <p>But £350,000-a-week enigma Mesut Ozil, handed his first trot for more than a month in the madcap Carabao Cup thriller at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> in midweek, is in the matchday squad and could make only his second Premier League appearance of the season.</p>

      <p>Xhaka, installed as captain after Emery's dressing room poll of his players, was never likely to feature against Wolves after telling his own fans to “f*** off” and sarcastically conducting their jeers in the 2-2 draw with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> last weekend.</p>
      <p>And by staying out of the firing line this weekend, Xhaka will not have to face his most voluble critics until the next home game with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/southampton-fc">Southampton</a> on November 23.</p>
      <p>Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, runner-up to Xhaka in Emery's bizarre vox pop, will captain the Gunners this afternoon.</p>
      <p>But even by Arsenal's standards of self-flagellation, it has been a dispiriting week: After surrendering a two-goal lead twice, the skipper is now being hidden in Emery's cupboard under the stairs.</p>

      <p>Xhaka's laboured apology on Thursday night, when he revealed abuse on social media had driven him to “boiling point,” has merely extended the soap opera.</p>
      <p>And Emery still hasn't revealed whether Xhaka will remain in office as his captain when the furore has died down.</p>
      <p>The Gunners boss said: “He is training normally, but like every human he feels emotions. Xhaka's issues last week need time to recover the normality with him and with us.</p>
      <p>“Everybody will have some social media on their phone, on the internet, on the web, but really to use it is only to be intelligent.</p>

      <p>“We can respect the people on social media, but we have to separate how much of it is real and whether every supporter is following that.</p>
      <p>“In the stadium, is is normal when we are not winning that they respond with some criticism – and then, when you come back with a good performance, they forget that and they applaud the players.</p>
      <p>“Our objective is to win (against Wolves), connect with the people and for the supporters to respond to us, and help us in the 90 minutes.</p>
      <p>“Xhaka has said sorry, he gave apologies to the supporters, to everybody, and now the focus is on our next match.”</p>
      <p>Ozil's return to the frame will give his cheerleaders fresh hope of Arsenal's playmaker being used as more than an expensive luxury by Emery, who said: “Now I am seeing him positive and consistent. His performance at Liverpool is the way we want.</p>
      <p>“I an helping him, supporting him, demanding of him. This is the Mesut I think everyone wants.</p>
      <p>“He has big experience, and when you talk about players who are ready to play under high pressure, he is one of them.</p>
      <p>“When he is in that positive way, when he is available consistently, he has he respect from us and every supporter.”</p>
