      <h1>Coinbase Data Shows That Bitcoin Has Outperformed S&amp;P 500 Since 2013</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T22:21:00+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 22:21</time> by <a rel="author">Joeri Cant</a></address>
      <p>According to a new report by United States-based cryptocurrency exchange and wallet service Coinbase, Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index">BTC</a>) continues to outperform the world’s most popular stock indexes.</p>
      <p>Coinbase published its latest <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/charting-the-course-of-bitcoin-11-years-and-counting-b4e17969d4e1">report</a> on the day that the Bitcoin whitepaper turned 11 years old, claiming that BTC has outperformed tech stocks and the S&amp;P 500 since 2013, saying:</p>
      <blockquote>“While Bitcoin’s price fluctuates, it’s trending up and to the right following many bull runs. This year, Bitcoin has also outperformed world stock market indexes.”</blockquote>
      <h3>Bitcoin generated 132% return this year alone</h3>
      <p>Coinbase points out that Bitcoin generated an impressive 132% return this year alone, while in comparison, the Nasdaq 100 only generated 17%, the S&amp;P 500 12%, the FTSE Europe 100 11%, while the FTSE ASEAN 40 had to swallow a loss of 3%.</p>
      <p>In a national survey of 4,415 people that Coinbase conducted with Qriously, most investors were seemingly convinced that cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin will have a higher return than exchange-traded funds, index funds and stock in their own company 10 years from now.</p>
      <p>Coinbase’s report estimates that 27 million Americans have been using the world’s biggest cryptocurrency in 2019, which represents only 9% of the U.S. population, indicating that Bitcoin adoption is still in its infancy and only needs time to flourish, saying:</p>
      <blockquote>"Email was invented in 1972, but it took until 1997 to adopt, surpassing 10 million people. The television set was invented in 1927, but by the late 1940s only 2% of American families had one.”</blockquote>
      <p>Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong recalled how he discovered Bitcoin in 2010. The CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/1189922493705768962">said</a> that he instantly understood that Bitcoin could be the most significant invention since the internet:</p>
      <blockquote>“Back in 2010 I read the Bitcoin white paper for the first time - perusing Hacker News one day. It immediately captured my attention. I felt like it could be the most significant idea I'd encountered since the internet.”</blockquote>
      <h3>Cryptocurrency will continue to outperform stocks </h3>
      <p>In February of 2019, Morgan Creek co-founder Anthony Pompliano <a href="https://twitter.com/apompliano/status/1092118835375861762">stated</a> that holding 99% cash and 1% Bitcoin over the last 10 years was a better investment than investing in the greatest stock market bull run in history. Sharing his bullish sentiment, he said, “Crypto will outperform stocks for the next 10 years too.”</p>
