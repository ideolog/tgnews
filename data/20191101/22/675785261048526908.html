      <h1>Frank Lampard sends Olivier Giroud warning after latest Chelsea snub</h1>
      <h2>Olivier Giroud has only made five appearances for Chelsea this season and hasn't started in the Premier League since August 18</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T22:30:00+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">Neil McLeman, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/neil-mcleman/</a></address>
      <p>Frank Lampard has told Olivier Giroud that club comes before country after the World Cup winner failed to make <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> ’s Carabao Cup side.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> striker has made only two starts this season and France coach Didier Deschamps has appealed for his leading striker to be given more game time.</p>
      <p>Yet when the Blues boss rotated his team in midweek, it was Belgium’s Michy Batshuayi who replaced top scorer Tammy Abraham.</p>
      <p>All three forwards will want to star at Euro 2020 next summer and need to impress their national coaches. But Lampard insisted: “It is difficult for me and it is difficult for them – we both have our jobs so it doesn’t feature in my thinking. I have care for all the players. I have to pick the squad as I see it for the best of Chelsea as they do for their countries.</p>

      <p>“I have got three strikers to pick from and I have to make the choices. Again I can’t complain about any of their attitudes.</p>
      <p>“Things will look different and that is where you need professionalism. Between those three I have had it from all of them.”</p>
      <p>Giroud is out of contract in the summer and had been linked with a move to the MLS after the Euros. But the Frenchman could seek a change in January – with Lyon linked with him this week – although Chelsea will not be able to replace him because of their transfer ban.</p>

      <p>“I would always have a conversation with a player who says they don’t want to play for the football club, whoever they are,” said Lampard. “That is something where I would have a clear and honest conversation with them. We are not at that point yet so it is not one to discuss right now.”</p>
      <p>Batshuayi has yet to start a Premier League game this season but netted a stunning solo effort against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> . “He loves scoring goals,” said Lampard.</p>
      <p>“That might sound simple for a striker but I’ve seen some that don’t love it quite as much. He does.”</p>
      <p>Chelsea’s run of seven consecutive wins was ended by Marcus Rashford in midweek and Lampard reckoned today’s (sat) trip to bottom club <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/watford-fc">Watford</a> is “dangerous”. He said: “We can’t underestimate a team that will be hurting because they haven’t won for a while and will have every ambition to try to win this game.”</p>
