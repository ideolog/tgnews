        <b>Air raid sirens sounded Friday evening near the Israeli city of Sderot, which sits a short distance from the border with Gaza, according to the Israel Defense Force. Several hours later, the IDF responded with retaliatory strikes in Gaza.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Following two sets of rocket attacks near Sderot that originated in the Gaza Strip, <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/gaza-barrage-israel-intercepts-seven-rockets-no-casualties-reported-1.8065731">Haaretz</a> has reported that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is in contact with the IDF chief of staff and is "instructing the army to respond to the rocket fire with the necessary measures."</p>
      <blockquote>Video captured nearby showed Israel's Iron Dome air defense system intercepting several projectiles.</blockquote>

      <p>ELINT <a href="https://twitter.com/ELINTNews/status/1190346934504116224">reported</a> at least 10 rockets had been fired from Gaza and the the Iron Dome system intercepted eight of them. However, the IDF <a href="https://twitter.com/IDF/status/1190347196471947265?s=20">only reported</a> seven rockets, claiming all had been shot down. One <a href="https://twitter.com/ignis_fatum/status/1190348215830364161">person</a> reported a rocket landed in a field outside Sderot.</p>

      <blockquote>​Roughly 42 minutes after sounding the first alarm, the IDF <a href="https://twitter.com/IDF/status/1190354452731105286">reported</a> a second wave of rockets had been detected, triggering air raid sirens once again. <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/Flash.aspx/475724">Arutz Sheva</a> confirmed that one rocket struck a house in Sderot without causing injuries.</blockquote>

      <p>​On Thursday, Israeli fighters <a href="https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/201910311077192459-missile-fired-at-israel-from-gaza-strip---idf/">shot down</a> an unidentified drone flying over the Gaza Strip, which is autonomously governed by the Palestinian Hamas group. The IDF said that air raid sirens in Beiri and Alumim, several miles south of Sderot, <a href="https://hamodia.com/2019/10/31/sirens-sound-gaza-rocket-fired-israel-no-injuries/">sounded</a> on Thursday as well, and one rocket landed in a field. The <a href="https://apnews.com/db50d7d4743d437ab880cf9b4b30a01f">AP reported</a> Israeli airstrikes in response hit two Hamas military posts in northern Gaza.</p>
