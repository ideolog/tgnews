      <h1>Northampton continue to set pace with comfortable victory over Harlequins</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T22:45:58+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 22:45</time> by <a rel="author">By Online Editors</a></address>
      <p>Early leaders <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/northampton">Northampton</a> blew <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/harlequins">Harlequins</a> away to secure a third win in as many Premiership matches.</p>
      <p>Taqele Naiyaravoro scored twice during a dominant first-half display in which Northampton earned a bonus point, with <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/northampton/players/teimana-harrison/">Teimana Harrison</a> and Mike Haywood also dotting down.</p>
      <p>Harlequins responded with a try either side of half-time, through <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/harlequins/players/cadan-murley/">Cadan Murley</a> and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/harlequins/players/chris-robshaw/">Chris Robshaw</a>, but Saints hit back and Harrison scored his second try before the end.</p>
      <p>Murley did also complete his double before full-time, but it was nowhere near enough as Quins suffered a 40-22 defeat.</p>
      <p>Marcus Smith put the away side ahead with a penalty, but that was all they had to cheer about early on as Northampton took control.</p>

      <p>Rory Hutchinson’s sublime pass set up Naiyaravoro out wide and the powerhouse wing was far too strong for the Quins defence, shoving his way over the line.</p>
      <p>James Grayson could not land the conversion from the touchline, but he did better with another effort soon after as <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/northampton/players/david-ribbans/">David Ribbans</a> did some fine work in the build-up to a Harrison try.</p>
      <p>Grayson’s successful penalty made it 15-3 and Harlequins were floundering as Saints continued to march forward.</p>
      <p>Naiyaravoro soon picked up a pass out wide and used his strength once more to barge a defender away before diving over in the corner.</p>
      <p>Grayson converted and Northampton were just one try from the bonus point – less than half an hour into the contest.</p>
      <p>It took them a further 11 minutes to get it as hooker Haywood, making his first start since last November, got the ball down from the back of a dominant lineout drive.</p>
      <p>Grayson missed the conversion but Northampton were in cruise control at 27-3 up.</p>
      <p>Quins threatened to respond late in the half as full-back <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/harlequins/players/aaron-morris/">Aaron Morris</a> was stopped at the last by Andy Symons.</p>
      <p>Murley was able to reduce the deficit before half-time though as the replacement found space and used it well.</p>
      <p>Smith missed the conversion at the end of what was a tough half for his team, but they emerged with purpose in the second period, putting pressure on.</p>
      <p>Northampton eventually paid the price as a quick tap penalty allowed Robshaw to go over, with replacement Brett Herron converting.</p>
      <p>But Grayson landed a drop goal to ensure Northampton would lead by 15 points with 20 minutes to go.</p>
      <p>And the fly-half soon slotted a penalty before a lovely flowing move saw Hutchinson, <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/northampton/players/fraser-dingwall/">Fraser Dingwall</a> and Grayson all combine before Harrison scored his second in the corner.</p>
      <p>Murley had the final say with his second effort of the night which was again converted by Herron.</p>
      <p>Saints lock <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/northampton/players/alex-coles/">Alex Coles</a> saw yellow before the end, but Northampton had done more than enough to win it.</p>
