      <h1>Labour announce plans for all new homes to be 'zero carbon' within three years</h1>

      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T22:30:00+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">Oliver Milne, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/oliver-milne/</a></address>
      <p>ALL newly built homes will be "zero carbon" within three years of a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> government coming to power.</p>
      <p>The party unveiled plans which it says are aimed at tackling the housing and climate crises at the same time.</p>
      <p>A Labour government will introduce a new "zero carbon standard" so that day-to-day running of the home will not add additional carbon to the atmosphere.</p>
      <p>They said the plan could save people living in new builds £200 a year in energy bills, and could mean that all new homes are fitted with solar panels, super-efficient insulation and triple-glazed windows, and are not fitted with fossil fuel heating systems such as gas boilers as standard.</p>
      <p>An original zero carbon homes standard, set out by the last Labour government, was due to come into force in 2016, but was scrapped by the Conservatives in 2015.</p>

      <p>Labour leader <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a> said: "Homes should be safe and warm for families and not damage the environment for future generations.</p>
      <p>"But our housing currently contributes a massive 14% of the UK's greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
      <p>"We will tackle the housing and climate crises at the same time by building warm and energy efficient homes.</p>
      <p>"At this election, the choice is clear - this is our last chance to take action to protect future generations or allow the Tories to accelerate our planet's destruction.</p>
      <p>"The next Labour government will usher in a Green Industrial Revolution to tackle climate change and create hundreds of thousands of green jobs."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>John Healey MP, Labour's shadow housing secretary, said: "The Conservatives' decision to cave in to property developers and slash green standards means we are building homes today that aren't fit for the future - they're bad for the environment and expensive to run.</p>
      <p>"After nearly 10 years of the Conservatives outsourcing housing policy to commercial house builders, we need a Labour government that will set common-sense rules which save households money and cut emissions."</p>
