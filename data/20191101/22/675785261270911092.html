      <p>A teenager who was hurled through the air broke both her legs after she was hit by a car being pursued by police.</p>
      <p>Danae Mills-Beresford, 15, was walking with her father, Nigel, when she was hit by the car travelling at 70mph, according to the dad.</p>
      <p>The incident happened on Tuesday, October 29 around 10pm, when officers from Nottinghamshire Police tried to stop a Vauxhall Astra.</p>
      <p>According to police watchdog the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), which is investigating, a police chase ensued on the Broxtowe Estate when the Astra collided with Danae.</p>
      <p>The car was abandoned in Bells Lane and the driver fled on foot.</p>
      <p>Nigel, 32, is now desperate to find out who was driving the car that hit Danae - leaving her in need of multiple surgeries.</p>
      <p>He said: "The car came out of nowhere. It was horrible. She's doing very well but she is lucky. She's got a long journey ahead of her."</p>
      <p>The impact of the crash has left Danae with two broken legs were broken and a broken left arm.</p>
      <p>She also has lacerations to her kidney and two black eyes, reports <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/local-news/find-whoever-daughter-dad-speaks-3493051">Nottinghamshire Live.</a></p>
      <p>Her mum, Kelly Mills, 30 said there were fears Danae might lose her right leg due to a blockage in her main artery.</p>

      <p>She is currently being treated in  <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/queens-medical-centre">Queen's Medical Centre</a>  and will be having more surgery on Monday to her left leg and wrist.</p>
      <p>Mr Beresford recalls the night of the incident, as he was walking with Danae talking about films on the way back from the shops.</p>
      <p>Danae and her dad were crossing the road at the junction of Broxtowe Lane and Nuthall Road.</p>
      <p>"I tried to push her out the way but she moved back," he said.</p>
      <p>"So I grabbed her to pull her back but she got the full impact of the car into her right leg.</p>
      <p>"She went into the air and landed quite far away. I was hysterical.</p>

      <p>"An off duty trauma doctor was driving nearby and came to help, followed by a police officer.</p>
      <p>"It all happened so fast but it felt like slow motion. I moved away from the scene, and then drove behind the ambulance to the hospital."</p>
      <p>Mr Beresford estimated the car was travelling around 70mph in what is a 30mph zone.</p>

      <p>"I'm not happy there was a chase in the area. There were a lot of people still walking around.</p>
      <p>"Danae is lucky to be alive.  One of her trainers is still missing from the night because of how hard she was hit.</p>
      <p>"I've thanked a lot of people already for their support but it has been a difficult time. Everyone's been traumatised.</p>
      <p>"Both her mum and I are spending most of our time in hospital with Danae.</p>
      <p>"I want the people who did it to know what they're responsible for doing. I want justice for my daughter."</p>
      <p>The case has been referred from Nottinghamshire Police to the  Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC).</p>
      <p>A spokesman for the IOPC told Nottinghamshire Live: “We declared an independent investigation on October 30 and have begun to gather accounts from the officers involved, in-car footage from the police vehicles, and other relevant information.</p>
      <p>"Our investigation is at an early stage and will examine the circumstances of the brief pursuit.</p>
      <p>"We will be contacting the injured girl’s family to explain our role and provide what information we are able as our investigation progresses."</p>
