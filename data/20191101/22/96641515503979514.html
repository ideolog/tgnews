      <h1>Motorola's foldable RAZR may have been spotted in the wild</h1>
      <h2>A real-life picture of the 'flip phone' with a flexible screen popped up on Weibo.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T22:33:00+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 22:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.facebook.com/richard.lawler" target="_blank">Richard Lawler</a></address>
      <p>Yesterday <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/10/31/motorola-foldable-display-razr-leaks-official-looking-images/">a flurry of leaked photos showed Motorola's upcoming RAZR posed for press pics</a>, but now a picture has surfaced on China's Weibo network claiming to show one in the wild. <a href="https://www.weibo.com/1904634630/Ie9LyE5uN?type=comment#_rnd1572655252257">Sunniton</a> posted this picture saying it was the real thing, showing the device fully unfolded, in someone's hands. The chunky bottom chin is on full display, and what appears to be a notch at the top.</p>
      <p>At this point we've heard all about its purported $1,500 price, midrange-ish specs and of course, the flexible screen inside that might bring back the classic feeling of snapping a phone closed to end a call. Yesterday's pictures also showed that the device could be used by touch with it folded closed thanks to controls and a small screen on the outside that's also useful for taking selfies. With less than two weeks to go before <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/10/17/motorola-razr-invite/">Motorola's planned press event on November 13th</a>, we can only wait and see what else leaks out before the device is officially revealed.</p>
