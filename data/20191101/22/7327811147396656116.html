      <p>NEW YORK (WABC) -- A doctor in Manhattan says reviews about him on Yelp were false, and now he's suing the people who posted them.</p>
      <p>It's not just the bad reviews, but the false ones, he says.</p>
      <p>"If somebody is writing that my Botox is coming out of China, that is defamation," said Dr. Muhammad Mirza.</p>
      <p>And that forced Dr. Mirza to sue.</p>
      <p>"It's a very growing trend," said legal analyst David Schwartz. "Because you have to realize the businesses are under attack, they're under attack by negative reviews. It could ruin their entire business."</p>
      <p>One reviewer with the moniker Bryan posted: "I just can't believe this is even legal the way he operate. Never Ever go to this horrible dungeon services!"</p>
      <p>Some accused the doctor of using fake products.</p>
      <p>He denies the claims and spent 18 months fighting Yelp in California courts to get the names of the reviewers. He won.</p>
      <p>"It's easy to write a review because you're hiding behind the screen but in a court of law merit prevails and when merit prevails truth comes out," said Dr. Mirza.</p>
      <p>He filed lawsuits against a dozen reviewers for defamation.</p>
      <p>One responded on Yelp, saying: "And to Dr.Mirza come sue me lol. You're a joke. I'm within my legal ground and my father is one of the best rated attorneys on Avvo in NY. The only one who should be sued is you for malpractice."</p>
      <p>Dr Mirza says he's already won or reached settlements with three reviewers, forcing them to take down the false review and pay an undisclosed amount of money.</p>
      <p>The doctor says the legal fight has cost him more than $100,000 in legal fees.</p>
      <p>"If you don't defend the truth and if you persistently keep feeding society with falsehood bad things happen," he said.</p>
      <p>The ruling also prohibits the reviewers from talking about Dr. Mirza and his practice publicly. But he hopes it's a warning.</p>
      <p>"These sites are being hijacked for purposes of trying to destroy legitimate businesses," said Schwartz.</p>
