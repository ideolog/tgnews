      <h1>Lady Gaga — Who You Might Have Forgotten Is Italian — Will Star in a Gucci Murder Movie</h1>

      <p>As Lady Gaga once said, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/12/jonah-hill-lady-gaga-100-people-in-a-room.html">there can be 100 people in a room</a>, and maybe 99 of them <a href="https://twitter.com/ladygaga/status/1162208642478661632?s=20">know you’re Italian</a>, but all you need is 1 person who doesn’t for you to bring it up. Or something like that, anyway. Well, if you enjoyed <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/11/a-star-is-born-bradley-cooper-and-lady-gaga-compliments.html">the <i>Star Is Born</i> press tour</a>, just get ready for this one: Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta, a.k.a. Lady Gaga, will play Patrizia Reggiani, Maurizio Gucci’s ex-wife, in <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2017/12/ridley-scott-all-the-money-in-the-world-reshoots.html">Ridley Scott</a>’s upcoming movie about his murder. If you don’t know the story, Gucci left Reggiani for a younger woman in 1985 after 12 years, and Reggiani was found guilty of setting up his 1995 murder. Gucci has not yet been cast, and there aren’t details about when they’ll start shooting, but don’t expect this film any time soon thanks to <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/12/lady-gagas-vegas-residency-reviewed.html">Lady Gaga’s Vegas residency</a> running through May. In the meantime, we’ll hope this doesn’t put a hold on <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/lady-gagas-sixth-album-will-be-called-adele.html"><i>LG6</i></a> — maybe we’ll even get a “Donatella” sequel now?</p>
