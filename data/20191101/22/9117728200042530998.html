      <h1>Verstappen: Gap to Hamilton in FP2 not representative because of tow on straight</h1>

        <b><a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/red-bull-racing">Aston Martin Red Bull Racing</a> star <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/max-verstappen">Max Verstappen</a> claims the gap between himself and pacesetter <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/lewis-hamilton">Lewis Hamilton</a> in FP2, which was just over three-tenths, was exaggerated, as the Brit got a big tow on the back straight which boosted his lap.</b>
      </p>
      <p>After leading the way in FP1, Verstappen finished the second practice session of the day in third place, losing out to Hamilton and <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/charles-leclerc">Charles Leclerc</a>, with the latter beating the Dutchman by a mere 0.014 seconds.</p>
      <p>To the naked eye, it might seem like Hamilton is simply the quickest track at COTA, but Verstappen added a caveat to the Brit's lap time.</p>

      <p><i>“Lewis had a tow on the back straight so it’s not really </i>[representative]<i>, the lap time,"</i> the 22-year-old was quoted by <i><a href="https://www.racefans.net/2019/11/01/verstappen-hamiltons-advantage-exaggerated-by-slipstream/">RaceFans.net</a>.</i><i> "I think it’s smaller."</i></p>
      <p>The gap between himself and Leclerc was extremely small in qualifying trim, but the Dutchman's long-run pace was several tenths better during FP2 - almost half a second, in fact. Still, the seven-time Grand Prix winner wasn't happy.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“The long runs I think I was not entirely happy, we can still do a little bit better. But this track is very aggressive on tyres as well.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"So, I think if we can keep the tyres under the control then suddenly everything looks a lot better. But overall a good start to the weekend.”</i>
