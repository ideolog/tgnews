      <h2>Anthony Martial has turned his frown upside-down to score two goals in three games after returning from his Man Utd injury</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T22:30:00+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">David McDonnell, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/david-mcdonnell/</a></address>
      <p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer says Anthony Martial is back to his best after swapping sulks for smiles.</p>
      <p>Martial has returned from a two-month injury lay-off with two goals in his last three games, with Solskjaer crediting it with a change in outlook.</p>
      <p>“He looks happier,” said Solskjaer of Martial, who gained a reputation as a moody player under previous bosses Jose Mourinho and Louis van Gaal. “He seems happy.</p>
      <p>“He’s an infectious boy, his smile and sense of humour, you can see he’s happy here and that rubs off on everyone and it’s great to see.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think he has had a long run of games as a No.9 since he played many years ago as a boy, and now he’s maturing, he’s 24.</p>

      <p>“You have to be obsessed with scoring goals as a No.9 and he’s looking more and more like a player who wants to score goals and not just show his tricks.</p>
      <p>“For me, he’s matured a lot in his behaviour on the training ground as well.</p>
      <p>“I believe we’ll see the best of him in the next few years.”</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, United have chartered a flight to Kasakhstan for their Europa League tie against Astana for around 100 fans who lost their bookings when Thomas Cook collapsed.</p>
      <p>Thomas Cook Sports, who were travel partners with United, had pre-sold travel packages to fans for the away leg of United’s tie against Astana.</p>
      <p>United have confirmed that fans who can provide proof of booking with Thomas Cook will be awarded free return flights to the November 28 tie, a 6,000-mile round trip.</p>
      <p>A United spokesman said: “We have been working through a range of contingency plans to minimise the impact of the Thomas Cook situation for our supporters.</p>
      <p>“We are pleased to be able to confirm that <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> will be operating a complimentary trip to the forthcoming match against FC Astana in Kazakhstan for those who were impacted by the insolvency of Thomas Cook.</p>
      <p>“Beyond the Astana fixture, we are investigating longer term options around facilitating European travel for our loyal fans.”</p>
