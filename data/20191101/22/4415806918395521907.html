      <p>Hoffenheim secured a fourth straight league win as they cruised to a 3-0 victory over rock-bottom Paderborn in the Bundesliga.</p>
      <p>The hosts scored all their goals in the opening 25 minutes with little doubt over the destination of the three points.</p>
      <p>Robert Skov needed only two minutes to open the scoring with a free-kick after Ihlas Bebou was fouled by Jamilu Collins.</p>
      <p>And they doubled their lead with a quarter of an hour gone as Pavel Kaderabek turned in a beautiful flick from Florian Grillitsch.</p>
      <p>Kaderabek then turned provider as his cross found on-loan Brighton striker Jurgen Locadia to make it 3-0 with 25 minutes gone.</p>
      <p>Paderborn did their best to mount a response but Gerrit Holtmann saw a long-range effort saved before Sebastian Vasiliadis fired narrowly wide before the break.</p>
      <p>The win sees Hoffenheim move up to fifth before the rest of the weekendâ€™s fixtures, while Paderborn remain on four points from 10 games.</p>
