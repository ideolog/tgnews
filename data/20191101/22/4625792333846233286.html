      <p>President Trump used Beto O’Rourke’s words from the beginning of his 2020 campaign to mock the end of his presidential bid.</p>
      <p>In a celebratory tweet, Trump pointed to O’Rourke’s <i>Vanity Fair</i> campaign launch and scoffed at his campaign-ending announcement.</p>
      <p>"Oh no, Beto just dropped out of race for President despite him saying he was 'born for this.' I don’t think so!" he tweeted Friday.</p>

      <p>When O’Rourke announced earlier this year he was running, he claimed he felt he was destined to be president, saying, “Man, I’m just born to be in it.”</p>
      <p>He <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/beto-orourke-nobody-is-born-to-be-president">later backtracked</a> on this campaign talking point, saying, “Nobody is born to be president of the United States of America — least of all me."</p>
      <p>He <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/beto-orourke-drops-out-of-2020-presidential-race">announced the end of his campaign</a> on Friday, saying, "Thank you for making this campaign possible, and for continuing to believe that we can turn this moment of great peril into a moment of great promise for America and the world."</p>
