      <h1>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer insists Man Utd striker Marcus Rashford won't burn out</h1>
      <h2>Marcus Rashford has played more minutes than any other Man Utd player this season - starting 12 of the Red Devils' 15 games</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T22:30:00+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">David McDonnell, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/david-mcdonnell/</a></address>
      <p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is adamant Marcus Rashford will not suffer burn-out – despite admitting the forward could do with a break.</p>
      <p>Rashford has played more ­minutes than any other United player this ­season and has featured in every game for which he has been available.</p>
      <p>The England forward, who turned 22 on Thursday, has started 12 of United’s 15 games this season, coming off the bench in two and sitting out just one.</p>
      <p>Rashford scored a spectacular 35-yard free-kick in midweek to seal a 2-1 Carabao Cup win for United at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> , but came off with a knee issue late on.</p>

      <p>Solskjaer admitted ­recently he was ­unable to give Rashford a rest because of Anthony Martial’s prolonged ­absence with a thigh injury.</p>
      <p>And with Rashford bang in form, with four goals in his last four United games, he doesn’t want one anyway.</p>
      <p>Solskjaer said: “I’ve been able to rest him a couple of times in ­Europe, but he’s such a fit boy, a professional boy. He looks after himself.</p>
      <p>“Hopefully he had loads of sweets on his birthday, so his ­energy levels are up.</p>

      <p>“But when you score goals, when you get performances, you just want to play games. The rhythm of playing, resting, recovering and playing again, sometimes that’s just as good.</p>
      <p>“Since Anthony Martial’s comeback, Marcus has blossomed. He is probably happier facing goal, being direct, driving at people, taking players on rather than being a target man with his back to goal.</p>
      <p>“But Marcus wants to master all the skills – maybe playing as a two with Anthony, maybe as a three against Norwich, or wide like we did against Chelsea.</p>
      <p>“And it was important he stepped up for that penalty against Chelsea.”</p>

      <p>In the summer, Solskjaer said Rashford, whose best goal haul for a season is 13, was capable of scoring 20 in a single campaign.</p>
      <p>Rashford already has eight this term, with Solskjaer claiming he can maintain his scoring run and set a new personal best.</p>
      <p>“He knows he can get loads of goals, but he needs to add the scruffy ones, the tap-ins, like against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> , from two yards.</p>
      <p>“He’s improving all the time and he didn’t really see those opportunities a year ago. He’s now quicker at reacting and smelling a goal, he sees it’s worth a 40-yard sprint.</p>
      <p>“For me though, I don’t think he should set himself a target of 20 or 25 goals. Set yourself a target of the next game, the next goal.”</p>
      <p>Rashford celebrated his stunning free-kick at Chelsea with a knee slide, after which he grimaced, suggesting he may have injured himself in the celebration.</p>
      <p>But Solskajer said: “Yeah, well, it wasn’t the knee slide. It was a tackle. Hopefully he will be ready for tomorrow.”</p>
      <p>Solskjaer famously celebrated his Champions League and Treble-winning goal against Bayern Munich in 1999 with a knee slide in the Nou Camp, injuring himself in the process.</p>
      <p>“But that was not the knee I had to retire through. It was different,” he said. “The players can do whatever they want when they score goals, because it might be the last one you score.”</p>
