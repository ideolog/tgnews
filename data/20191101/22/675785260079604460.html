      <h2>Mel Owen looks set to drop a baby bombshell in front of half the Square before a dramatic high speed chase on EastEnders</h2>

      <p>EastEnders have revealed an explosive new trailer featuring a high speed car chase.</p>
      <p>The race is on for Sharon Mitchell to try and stop Mel Owen from taking the ultimate revenge.</p>
      <p>Mel seems hellbent on exposing Sheanu's baby secret - and considers Sharon and Louise's joint 50th and 18th birthday party as the ideal place.</p>
      <p>EastEnders viewers can't wait to watch the legendary final battle between the two warring women.</p>
      <p>The exciting trailer begins with Mel looking at an old photo with Sharon hanging up in E20 as she plots her revenge scheme.</p>

      <p>"Louise’s 18th. Sharon’s 50th. Someone's got to say a few words," says Mel with a wry grin on her face.</p>
      <p>Sharon is then seen marching through the Square with Keanu - fearing that Mel will reveal their dirty secret to Phil Mitchell.</p>
      <p>Sharon warns: "She’s going to blow the whole lot. Me, you, the baby, everything."</p>

      <p>In the E20 office, Mel stares at a photo of her dead son Hunter.</p>
      <p>Discussing her friend's mindset, Lisa says: "She’s still in a really bad place. And every now and then she’s going to lose it."</p>
      <p>Mel then composes herself before putting on a happy face and walking back to the dance floor, presumably to drop a bombshell.</p>

      <p>"I always look out for you," Mel tells Louise as they hug, while grinning across the room at Keanu.</p>
      <p>What follows is a lot of stunned faces, including Kathy and Ian Beale, and shocked Kush Kazemi puts his hand to his chest.</p>
      <p>Horrified Louise then puts her hand over her mouth - but what has she discovered?</p>

      <p>In the garage, worried Keanu asks: "What are we going to do Sharon?"</p>
      <p>The mechanic then tells his older lover to get to Phil before Mel manages to.</p>
      <p>Sharon and Mel are then engaged in a high speed chase on the motorway.</p>
      <p>They both look across at one another as they seemingly hurry to reach Phil first - but who will win?</p>
