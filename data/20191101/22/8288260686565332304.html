      <p>Online retailer Very has launched a massive early Black Friday deal on the Nintendo Switch.</p>
      <p>Very always takes part in Black Friday sales and often reduced the price of the PS4, XBox and Nintendo Switch games consoles.</p>
      <p>However, it has moved early to offer the first big discount on the popular Nintendo Switch console with a bundle offer that has impressed bargain-hunters. Shoppers on an extreme bargain-hunting <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/latestdealsuk/?fref=nf">Facebook group</a> spotted the big discount and many have already snapped up the deal.</p>
      <p>It is selling a <a href="https://fave.co/34jAiMz">Nintendo Switch grey console</a> with Lego Move 2, Lego DC Super Villians and Lego Worlds for just £329.99 online, which is down from £369.99.</p>
      <p>The £40 saving makes it one of the best Nintendo Switch bundle deals on the market today and the retailer is also offering ways to save an extra £50 with a discount code that can be found on the deal page, bringing the overall price down to £280.</p>
      <p>You can get the <a href="https://fave.co/34jAiMz">deal here</a> until 7 November.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The deal includes three games and is still cheaper than a Nintendo Switch with Mario Kart 8 at <a href="http://tidd.ly/6288a23d">Currys PC World</a> , which is currently £299, down from £319.99.</p>
      <p>Amazon has the same bundle for <a href="https://amzn.to/2N5V10o">£319.99</a> for Prime members, while</p>
      <p>The Nintendo Switch is one of the world's best-selling consoles. It can be played hooked up to a TV or on the move and it features popular games such as the Mario franchise, Pokemon and Lego.</p>
      <p>Last year hit game Fortnite was released on the system and device has been credited with helping turn around Nintendo's fortunes since it was released in 2017.</p>
