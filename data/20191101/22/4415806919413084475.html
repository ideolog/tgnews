      <p>Beto O’Rourke, the former Texas congressman, has announced he is ending his Democratic US presidential campaign.</p>
      <p>In an online post, Mr O’Rourke said: “My service to the country will not be as a candidate or as the nominee.”</p>
      <p>He was scheduled to address supporters later on Friday at an event in Iowa.</p>

      <p>Mr O’Rourke was urged to run for president by many Democrats who were energised by his narrow Senate loss last year in Texas, a reliably Republican state.</p>
      <p>He raised an astonishing amount of money from small donors across the country, visited every county in Texas and used social media and live-streaming video to engage directly with voters. He ultimately lost to incumbent Republican Senator Ted Cruz by three percentage points.</p>
      <p>But Mr O’Rourke struggled to replicate that model in the presidential primary and both his polling and his fundraising dwindled significantly in recent months.</p>

      <p>“Though it is difficult to accept, it is clear to me now that this campaign does not have the means to move forward successfully,” he wrote.</p>
      <p>“Acknowledging this now is in the best interests of those in the campaign; it is in the best interests of this party as we seek to unify around a nominee; and it is in the best interests of the country.”</p>
