      <h2>Chief coroner Mark Lucraft QC said “there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken” to stop suspects slip through the net</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T22:15:12+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 22:15</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Hughes, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/chris-hughes/</a></address>
      <p>Tough new laws are needed to stop another <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/london-bridge-terror-attack">London Bridge terror attack</a> – and MI5 must act to avoid letting suspects slip through the net, the chief <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/inquests">coroner</a> said yesterday.</p>
      <p>Ringleader Khuram Butt was a “subject of interest” and had downloaded terrorist material.</p>
      <p>Yet MI5 and counter-terror police had limited res­­ources and powers to deal with someone who owned terrorist propaganda and so were unable to step in, allowing the IS fanatic to plot the deadly attack.</p>
      <p>Butt, 27, Rachid Redouane, 30, and Youssef Zaghba, 22, were killed at Borough Market after murdering eight people in their rampage in June 2017.</p>
      <p>In his report, Mark Lucraft QC highlighted 18 “matters of concern” and said “there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken”.</p>
      <p>He added: “Consideration ought to be given to legislating for further offences of possession of the most serious material glorifying or encouraging terrorism.”</p>

      <p>The inquest had heard that police and MI5 did not recognise the threat posed by Butt, despite him appearing in a TV exposé called The Jihadis Next Door.</p>
      <p>Their probe was suspended twice due to lack of resources, and tip-offs about his extremism – including one from a family member – were not passed on.</p>
      <p>Mr Lucraft said: “Although MI5 must be able to divert resources, the suspension of priority investigations is a matter of legitimate public concern.”</p>
