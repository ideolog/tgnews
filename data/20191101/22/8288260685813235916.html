      <p>Neil Jones will not dance in the upcoming Strictly Come Dancing show.</p>
      <p>The professional announced that he is still nursing a muscle injury and will not compete alongside Alex Scott.</p>
      <p>She will instead be partnered for the second time by last year's winner Kevin Clifton.</p>
      <p>Jones announced on Strictly: It Takes Two that he would be ready to train again on Monday, assuming his celebrity partner makes it through the weekend.</p>
      <p>He said: "I won't be dancing. I've tried, but it's just not ready yet.</p>
      <p>"I'll be fine if I rest it this weekend."</p>

      <p>He added to Scott: "You nail the dance, go through, then I'm ready on Monday morning."</p>
      <p>The former Arsenal player said that it had been a challenging week without her usual partner, but she is lucky to still be dancing.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>She said: "It has been a strange week to be honest.</p>
      <p>"My partner, I'm used to him. It's really different dancing with someone else.</p>
      <p>"I can sit here and moan. Poor Will doesn't get to dance."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Clifton said that his temporary partner has been "fantastic" and he hopes to keep her in the competition long enough to return to Jones.</p>
      <p>He and Scott will dance the American Smooth in the next instalment of Strictly, which airs on BBC One this Saturday.</p>
