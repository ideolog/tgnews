      <p>Paris - <b>Gael Monfils </b>missed the chance to secure the last place at the ATP Tour Finals as Canadian youngster <b>Denis Shapovalov</b> dealt the home favourite a heavy defeat in the Paris Masters quarter-finals on Friday.</p>
      <p>Italian Matteo Berrettini, who lost to Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the second round at Bercy, claims the final spot for the end-of-season event in London which starts on November 10.</p>
      <p>The 20-year-old Shapovalov blew Monfils away with a totally one-sided 6-2, 6-2 victory in only 59 minutes.</p>
      <p>The world No 28 will face either Rafael Nadal or French wildcard Tsonga in the fourth Masters semi-final of his career.</p>
      <p>Shapovalov raced through the opening set in under half an hour before reeling off the first four games of the second in front of a stunned French crowd.</p>
      <p>The 13th seed Monfils managed to salvage some pride with a couple of late holds, but Shapovalov wrapped up the win with his fifth ace on his first match point.</p>
      <p>US Open semi-finalist Berrettini, who has won two ATP titles this year and climbed to a career-high world ranking of ninth, will be playing in the Tour Finals for the first time.</p>
      <p>
