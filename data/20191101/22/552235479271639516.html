      <p>I'm A Celeb bosses have gone all out to get the world's most famous transgender woman and will be hoping she lets slip some Kardashian secrets.</p>
      <p>The big money is set to join Ant McPartlin and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/rangers-hero-ally-mccoists-family-20550731">Dec Donnelly</a> in the jungle - and will come face to face with snakes, spiders and rats, the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/caitlyn-jenner-heading-im-celebrity-20791968">Mirror</a> reports.</p>
      <p>An ITV source told The Sun: “She’s such a huge name and a great get for producers.</p>
      <p>“ITV think she is one of their best ever signings. It’s a real bolt from the blue. They’ve asked her every year for a long time, but she finally felt the time was right.”</p>
      <p>An ITV spokesperson said: "Any names suggested for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/rangers-hero-ally-mccoists-family-20550731">I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Here!</a> are just speculation until we officially confirm our line up."</p>
