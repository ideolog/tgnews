      <p>MOSCOW: Belarusian high jumper Dzmitry Nabokau has been provisionally suspended after testing positive for a banned substance used to mask the presence of other drugs, the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) said on Friday.</p>

      <p>At the worlds in Doha, the 23-year-old Belarusian cleared 2.26 metres in qualifying but was later eliminated.</p>
      <p>The AIU, which oversees integrity issues in international athletics, including doping, said Nabokau had tested positive for furosemide, which is on the World Anti-Doping Agency's list of prohibited diuretics and masking agents.</p>
      <p>It did not say when the sample had been taken.</p>
      <p>Nabokau, who competed at the 2016 Summer Olympics, won silver at the world junior athletics championships in 2014.</p>
