      <p>It’s a confounding statistic that starkly illustrates the challenge facing Canadians in desperate need of life-saving organ transplants.</p>
      <p>Poll after poll has found that nine in 10 Canadians support the idea of donating organs and tissue to those in need, but only around two of those 10 have made the conscious effort to sign donor cards.</p>
      <p>Some 675,000 Albertans (about 18 per cent of adults in the province) have registered to become organ or tissue donors, while the province’s living donor ratio of 18.5 per million remains among the highest in Canada.</p>
      <p>But the gap between cultural acceptance and follow-through remains a puzzling one for patients, families and advocates alike, given the potential that exists to meet those demands and provide hope to thousands in desperate need of a life-changing gift.</p>
      <p>“It’s the power to change people’s lives. But the challenge is there’s not enough organs to meet the demand,” said Joyce Van Deurzen, executive director of the Southern Alberta and Saskatchewan branches of the Kidney Foundation of Canada.</p>
      <p>“Every survey done by anyone is saying 90 per cent would be willing to become an organ donor,” she said. “I look at this and it all points to the fact that people have good intentions, but we need to compel that into action.”</p>
      <p>Last year, some 2,800 organ transplants were performed nation-wide, 382 of those in Alberta. Meanwhile, nearly 4,500 Canadians were left on the wait list, including 654 from Alberta. Another 643 across Canada (46 in Alberta) died or were removed from those wait lists.</p>
      <p>While the challenges posed by limited supply and enduring demand remain something of a bottleneck, great strides have been made to help narrow the gap between prospective donors and transplant recipients in recent years.</p>
      <p>According to a background paper on organ donation and transplantation prepared for federal legislators last year, deceased donor rates saw a 42 per cent rise between 2007 and 2016, climbing from 485 donors to 758 donors, each of whom could provide as many as eight critical organs: heart, liver, pancreas, intestines and potentially two each of kidneys and lungs.</p>
      <p>However, living donor rates have seen a moderate decline over the last decade, dropping by 11 per cent between 2008 and 2017 to 14.6 donors per million population, the report found.</p>

      <p>Amber Appleby, director of organ and tissue donation and transplantation with Canadian Blood Services, said while it’s encouraging to see the improvements in securing more organs from deceased donors, more can be done to streamline the system and bring home the message on an issue she admits isn’t always top of mind for many Canadians.</p>
      <p>“We, as a donation community, need to make it easier for people and give them every opportunity to become donors,” she said, noting many myths abound when it comes to becoming an organ donor.</p>
      <p>“A lot of people self exclude because they don’t think they would be eligible. We need to make (the process) easier and more consistent.”</p>
      <p>Among the more common myths and misconceptions related to organ donation is the belief that age and relative health of a prospective donor are always disqualifying factors. And even for those who die in one of the two ways that allow for their organs to be reused — neurological death or cardio-circulatory death — only around one per cent will actually become posthumous donors.</p>
      <p>However, the most significant barrier, say advocates, remains the fact that most families don’t have the conversation with their loved ones regarding their wishes when it comes to organ donations until it’s too late. Thus, they will often err on the side of leaving those potentially vital organs and tissue untouched.</p>
      <p>For Toby and Bernadine Boulet of Lethbridge, whose 21-year-old son Logan was killed in last year’s devastating Humboldt Broncos bus crash, they were fortunate enough to have known his wishes before his untimely death.</p>
      <p>And that made what could have been a moment of doubt and angst become a moment of peace.</p>

      <p>“We really advocate having a conversation and to talk to your family so that people know what your wishes are,” said Bernadine.</p>
      <p>It was a conversation Logan had with his father Toby, less than a year before his tragic death, that made the decision to donate his organs and tissue less of a burden in the family’s darkest hours.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, Logan would share six of his organs and tissues, which were able to be successfully transplanted in patients whose lives have now been forever changed thanks to his sacrifice.</p>
      <p>Logan’s lungs, liver, one kidney, his corneas and his incredibly strong heart — which his parents say refused to stop beating, even after he was removed from life support — all managed to find their way into the donor stream.</p>
      <p>It was that sacrifice, during a dark chapter in Canadian history, that spurred what’s been called the Logan Boulet Effect.</p>

      <p>According to Canadian Blood Services, in the days after the April 6, 2018, crash, some 100,000 people across Canada registered as donors. In April of this year, which celebrated the first Green Shirt Day memorializing Logan’s selfless decision, at least 60,000 more signed up, about three times more than the average monthly rate.</p>
      <p>Officials can’t say for certain how many people have directly signed up as part of the Logan Boulet Effect, but the spikes in registrations in April 2018 and 2019 are believed to be directly related to the cause.</p>
      <p>For the Kidney Foundation’s Van Deurzen, that critical dialogue shared by the Boulets is a conversation that every family should have.</p>
      <p>“We encourage everyone to have that talk,” she said, noting in most cases where someone dies in a way that leaves the organs viable, doctors have to raise the question of donating organs and tissue on what’s often the worst day in a family’s life.</p>
      <p>“We have to prepare families to make those decisions in a time of tremendous trauma,” Van Deurzen says. “Studies about organ donations show it absolutely helps with the grieving process of families, but people do have regrets sometimes about not having said yes after the fact.”</p>
