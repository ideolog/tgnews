      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T22:41:10+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 22:41</time> by <a rel="author">James Rodger, https://www.facebook.com/jamesrodgerjournalist</a></address>
      <p>The 39 migrants found dead in the back of a lorry are believed to be Vietnamese nationals, Essex police has said.</p>
      <p>Assistant Chief Constable Tim Smith said on Friday evening: "At this time, we believe the victims are Vietnamese nationals, and we are in contact with the Vietnamese Government.</p>
      <p>"We are in direct contact with a number of families in Vietnam and the UK, and we believe we have identified families for some of the victims whose journey ended in tragedy on our shores."</p>
      <p>"The confirmatory evidence needed to formally present cases to HM Senior Coroner for her consideration has not yet been obtained.</p>
      <p>"This evidence is being gathered across a number of jurisdictions worldwide. As a result, we cannot at this time announce the identity of any of the victims."</p>

      <p>Mr Smith said specially trained people, supported by Vietnamese interpreters, were manning its dedicated hotline between 9am to midnight, seven days a week, for people seeking to be in touch about the incident.</p>
      <p>In a statement, the Vietnamese Embassy in London sent its "heartfelt condolences" to the families of the victims.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>It said it was "deeply saddened" that Essex Police's initial findings were that the victims may be Vietnamese.</p>
      <p>"Specific identities of the victims still need to be identified and confirmed by the relevant authorities of Vietnam and UK," the embassy said.</p>
      <p>Its statement added: "The Embassy of Vietnam in London will closely co-ordinate with the relevant authorities of Vietnam and UK to support the families of the Vietnamese victims, if any, to bring their loved ones home."</p>
      <p>"We strongly condemn the inhuman activities of the traffickers of illegal immigrants that have caused such a tragedy for the victims and their families.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"Vietnam will work closely with the UK to bring the criminals to justice and find effective measures to prevent a similar tragedy from happening again in the future."</p>
