      <h1>Centre following the fiscal glide path: DEA Secretary Atanu Chakraborty</h1>
      <h2>The Centre could still rein in the deficit at the targeted level in the current financial year</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T22:11:00+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 22:11</time> by <a rel="author">Arup Roychoudhury</a></address>
      <p>Economic Affairs Secretary <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/atanu-chakraborty">Atanu Chakraborty </a>said on Friday that the government has been following a glide path to reduce the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/fiscal-deficit">fiscal deficit </a>and will continue to do so, a day after data showed that Centre’s <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/fiscal-deficit">fiscal deficit </a>touched 92.6 per cent of the Budget Estimates (BE) in the first half of 2019-20.</p>
      <p>Chakraborty’s remarks came on the sidelines of a meeting between Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and United States Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.</p>
      <p>Though the April-September figures seem alarming, it is a bit lower than 95.3 per cent in the corresponding period of 2018-19. But, then, there was fiscal slippage in FY19, when the deficit rose to 3.4 per cent of gross domestic product, against the target of 3.3 per cent.</p>
      <p>The Centre could still rein in the deficit at the targeted level in the current financial year. However, tax revenues may take a hit due to recent cuts in the corporation tax rates.</p>
