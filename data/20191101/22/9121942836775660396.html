      <p>SU claimed its third WAC regular-season crown. It also won the title in 2013 and 2015. The Redhawks will have the top seed and earned a first-round bye in the WAC tournament, hosted by Air Force on Nov. 13-17.</p>

      <p>Valdez has pitched for 10 seasons in the minors, including stints with the farm systems for Cleveland (2009-10), Washington (2012-18) and Texas (2019).</p>
      <p>With the addition of Valdez, the Mariners’ 40-man roster is now at 35 players.</p>
