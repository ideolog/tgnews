      <p><b>BOSTONÂ (AP)</b> - Massachusetts' congressional delegation is calling on the State Department to withdraw its new "public charge" rule aimed at denying green cards to low income and poor immigrants.</p>
      <p>The 11 Democratic lawmakers argue in a letter dated Thursday that multiple federal courts have temporarily blocked a corresponding rule by the Department of Homeland Security.</p>
      <p>The rules were slated to take effect Oct. 15 and are part of the Trump administration's efforts to disqualify immigrants from legal U.S. residency if they might become a burden on government welfare programs like Medicaid, housing assistance and food stamps.</p>
      <p>The administration says it wants to ensure immigrants gaining legal status are self-sufficient, but critics say the rules are discriminatory and a betrayal of the country's values.</p>
      <p>The State Department said it will respond to the lawmaker's request "as timely and responsive as possible."</p>
