      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/media">The B</a>BC reportedly made an unforced error in revealing the names of 120 female employees who had made complaints about equal pay.</p>
      <p>The Guardian said Thursday that it had obtained a list that "includes many household names," workers who took issue with an apparent disparity in gender pay within the company. Many of them had previously signed a letter to the National Union of Journalists (NUJ) in 2017.</p>
      <p>The unredacted list emerged as part of BBC broadcaster Samira Ahmed's legal battle against the company.</p>
      <p>The BBC did not immediately respond to Fox News for comment. However, in a statement to The Guardian, a spokesperson insisted the network was not responsible for the leaked list.</p>

      <p>"This list was part of the evidence that the NUJ put before the tribunal, not the BBC,” the BBC spokesperson <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/oct/31/bbc-error-reveals-names-of-120-women-who-sought-equal-pay?">told The Guardian</a>.</p>
      <p>In an internal email sent to employees on Thursday, the BBC notified those who had filed complaints that they would were going to be named publicly.</p>
