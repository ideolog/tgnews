      <h3>Lt. Col Bharat Pannu creates Guinness World Record after covering 3600km from Kashmir to Kanyakumari in 8 Days and 9 Hours</h3>
      <p>In an attempt to set a new record for the fastest Kashmir to Kanyakumari Lieutenant Colonel Bharat Pannu, 36, has now covered the distance 3,604 km in 8 days, 9 hours and 48 minutes. The attempt according to Pannu and his crew was quicker than the previous recorder Vikas from Delhi who did the same in 10 days, 3 hours and 32 minutes.</p>
      <p>Pannu, an aeronautical engineer from Rohtak, joined the Indian Army in June 2005 and is currently deployed in Bengaluru. Speaking to a leading news agency, Pannu stated that he maintains helicopters of the Indian Army and practice cycling during the rest of the day.</p>
      <p>He had set off from Lal Chowk, Kashmir at 1:49 am on October 21, crossing 13 States and covering 3600 KMs, he reached Cape Camorin (Kanyakumari) on 29th Oct, 11:37 AM; taking overall, 8 Days 9 Hrs and 48 Mins, thus making a World Record for the #KashmirToKanyakumari Challenge.</p>

      <p>In 2017, Pannu was a finisher in the 2,200 km Race Around Austria and winner of the 1000-km Ultra Spice 2017 and 1,750 km Ultra Spice 2019.</p>
      <p>The army man pedalled about 20 to 21 hours a day covering over 450 km. Pannu was joined by an eight-member crew comprising of cycling enthusiasts and supporters in two cars. The proof of the attempt includes a set of documentation before and after the rides on the route sanctioned by the Guinness authorities.</p>
      <p>While the K2K route for cyclists might not make it to the headlines often, a navy officer, last year, to raise funds for war victims covered 4000km from Kashmir to Kanyakumari. Lieutenant Commander Manoj Gupta, an instructor at the Indian Naval Academy Ezhimala, did a solo ride from the Ladakh Scout Regimental Training Centre from June 6 to July 16, pedalling 4,000km.</p>
