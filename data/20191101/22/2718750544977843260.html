      <h1>The Sequel Is Confirmed and We Will Go Back Into The <i>Spider-Verse</i> In April of 2022</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T22:44:17+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 22:44</time> by <a rel="author">Jordan Crucchiola</a></address>
      <p>You’ve already waited long enough, but at least you know now exactly how much longer you will have to wait to go back <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/12/spider-man-into-the-spider-verse-review.html"><i>Into the Spider-Verse</i></a>. Producer Chris Miller tweeted a very short little promo video today (seriously, it’s just the Spider-Man symbol) with the news that a sequel to the <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/01/how-spider-man-into-the-spider-verse-changed-animation.html">Oscar-winning</a> animated film will hit theaters on April 8, 2022. Since the multiverse has been broken open, who knows what wonders will await in the next chapter, but we would very much like to see more <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/12/spider-ham-origin-who-is-spider-verses-peter-porker.html">Spider-Ham</a> and Spider-Gwen and <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/12/spider-man-into-the-spider-verse-looks-at-superhero-burnout.html">Jake Johnson’s Peter Parker</a> and, honestly, all the Spiders from the first movie could come back alongside <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/12/miles-morales-of-into-the-spider-verse-the-race-problem.html">Miles Morales</a> and that would be cool.</p>
