      <p>According to <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/lady-gaga-ridley-scott-movie-maurizio-gucci-patrizia-reggiani-murder-gucci-family-giannina-scott-1202774518/"><i>Deadline</i></a>, Gaga has joined the cast of the Ridley Scott directed flick and will portray Patrizia Reggiani, the ex-wife of Maurizio Gucci, who was the grandson of founder Gucci Gucci.</p>
      <p>Maurizio Gucci was shot to death in 1995, and Patrizia Reggiani was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/04/world/former-wife-given-29-years-for-ordering-gucci-slaying.html">convicted of ordering his murder</a> in 1998. She was released from prison in 2014.</p>
      <p>Scripted by Roberto Bentivegna, the movie will be based on Sara Gay Forden’s book <i>The House of Gucci: A Sensational Story of Murder, Madness, Glamour, and Greed</i>. It will be co-produced by Ridley Scott, Giannina Scott and Scott Free Productions.</p>
      <p>This is the first newly announced role for Gaga since starring as singer Ally alongside Bradley Cooper in last year’s acclaimed <i>A Star Is Born</i>. The movie saw her nominated for Best Actress at the 91st Academy Awards and <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/watch-lady-gaga-impassioned-speech-shallow-best-original-song-2019-oscars-2453549">she took home the Oscar for writing the song ‘Shallow’</a>, one of a number of hits on <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/album-review-a-star-is-born-official-soundtrack">the accompanying soundtrack.</a></p>
