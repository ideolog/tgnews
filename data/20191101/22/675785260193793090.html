      <p>A woman played a brilliant prank on trick-or-treaters on Halloween - and it involved Brussels sprouts.</p>
      <p>Billie-Anne McCarthy, from Eltham in southeast London, made a little plan for the kids who came by her shop hoping for some sweets.</p>
      <p>She covered raw Brussels sprouts in chocolate and mixed them in with other sweets, <a href="https://www.mylondon.news/news/south-london-news/woman-covers-brussels-sprouts-chocolate-17185382">My London reports.</a></p>
      <p>Responses on social media were mixed - with some seeing the funny side but others far from impressed.</p>
      <p>Billie-Anne posted on community <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> group Eltham, SE9: "Nice little trick for the trick or treaters later on.</p>
      <p>"I’m also a little evil and have no regrets," along with pictures of the chocolate-covered sprouts.</p>

      <p>While many thought this was a hilarious prank, some commenters didn't appreciate the joke, leading to a later edit which read: "For those who are so offended by this. 1: it was done at my work for the kids that come in the shop, 2: they were mixed in with proper sweets and EVERY kid that picked a sprout also got an actual sweet, 3: Parents were told what it was, 4: the parents were in stitches watching the kids eat them, 5: every kid that got one also thought it was funny."</p>
      <p>Billie-Anne revealed that last year she had done the same with mini pickled onions, and one woman commented to say she'd done the same but with fresh garlic.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Some parents expressed concern that kids were being fed things that they weren't expecting, and others said children should be taught to not take unwrapped sweets.</p>
      <p>One just thought it was an unfair trick to play on little children.</p>
      <p>But a fan of the prank wrote: "Love it. I'd bring my nephew over just to see his face when he takes a bite.</p>
      <p>Another agreed: "Nice to see someone sliding towards tricks rather than treats."</p>
      <p>Some commented on how much they loved sprouts and were keen to see how this tasted, while others said they would definitely be doing this next year.</p>
      <p>Creative suggestions for similar pranks were made, including leaving out orange chilli peppers and calling them mini pumpkins, or covering an egg in chocolate and telling kids it's a kinder egg.</p>
