      <p>The most pressing question that comes with any Pokémon game — besides the “Should I buy X or Y?” question — is which starter to pick. And while initial appearances may endear you to one, we all know that the decision can’t be made until after the evolutions are revealed.</p>
      <p>Well, thanks to a few Reddit leaks, we might be able to narrow down the difficult decision upcoming with <i>Pokémon Sword</i> and <i>Pokémon Shield</i>. Or not. We’re not able to confirm if these are real. But either way, here’s what’s been leaked.</p>
      <p>[<b>Ed. Note: </b>Possible spoilers for <i>Pokémon Sword </i>and <i>Shield</i> abound!]</p>
      <p>These are the leaked images of what could be first evolutions of Sobble and Grookey!</p>
      <blockquote><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonSwordAndShield/comments/dq75n8/possible_spoiler_these_starter_evolutions_look/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">[possible Spoiler] these starter evolutions look pretty real to me, especially as shinies. What do you guys think?</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonSwordAndShield/">PokemonSwordAndShield</a></blockquote>
      <p>Unfortunately, there were no Scorbunny evolution leaks, but there were images of other Pokèmon, some Galarian forms and some totally new.</p>

        <b>Update (Nov 4): </b>
        <i>There are now images of all three final starter evolutions, </i>

      <p>There are a lot of images floating around, but not all of them seem legit. Peruse the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonSwordAndShield/"><i>Pokémon Sword </i>and <i>Shield</i> Reddit</a> at your own discretion for spoilers and absorb the supposed leaks with a grain of salt.</p>
      <p>Here are some that seem the <i>most</i> legit.</p>
      <blockquote><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonSwordAndShield/comments/dq9ip5/possible_new_pokemon_elephant_pokemon/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">Possible New Pokemon (elephant pokemon)</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonSwordAndShield/">PokemonSwordAndShield</a></blockquote>
      <p>What could maybe be Galarian Meowth owns my heart.</p>
      <blockquote><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonSwordAndShield/comments/dq8yjc/potential_spoilers_galarian_meowth_found_on_4chan/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">(Potential Spoilers) Galarian Meowth? Found on 4Chan</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonSwordAndShield/">PokemonSwordAndShield</a></blockquote>
      <p>This one is allegedly called Perrseker and he’s probably a Bigger Meowth.</p>
