      <h1>Celtic boss Neil Lennon in graffiti dig as he blasts pundits over 'personal' Craig Levein attacks</h1>
      <h2>Hearts sacked Levein on Thursday but Lennon feels the vitriol aimed at the former Scotland manager has been way over the top.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T22:29:00+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 22:29</time> by <a rel="author">Michael Gannon, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/michael-gannon/</a></address>
      <p>Neil Lennon has blasted the punters and pundits who have clobbered <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/craig-levein">Craig Levein</a> and insisted the stick suffered by the ex-<a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hearts-fc">Hearts</a> boss has been shameful.</p>
      <p>Levein was dismissed as Tynecastle manager and director of footballon Thursday but he found an ally in his old Edinburgh sparring partner.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/neil-lennon">Lennon</a> clashed with the Jambos legend when he was Hibs gaffer – but he is adamant his former foe did not deserve the abuse he received in the last few weeks in the job.</p>
      <p>The Hearts’ Foundation Plaza was spray-painted with Levein Out before the axe fell while ex-Gorgie players have lined up to put the boot in following the decision to remove him from his post.</p>
      <p>Lennon was also targeted by vile graffiti in Edinburgh while he was Hibs manager.</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> boss said: “It leaves a bitter taste in my mouth the way some people have behaved towards him as well considering what he’s given to the club.</p>
      <p>“I think he deserves a certain amount of respect.</p>
      <p>“The job means everything to us – we’re professionals. We live our lives 24 / 7. We give our all and sometimes it doesn’t happen.</p>
      <p>“The vitriol at the minute in the game, certainly up here, is appalling I think – the way managers and players are being criticised and abused.</p>
      <p>“It gets very personal. These people don’t know Craig, they don’t know what he’s done, they have short memories.</p>
      <p>“The graffiti on Foundation Plaza was appalling. I know from my own experience that they like a bit of graffiti around the place.</p>

      <p>“It’s a sign of the times. I think it’s really tacky. I think some of the punditry aimed at Craig has been personal and I think that’s unprofessional as well.</p>
      <p>“I hope he comes again, put it that way.”</p>
      <p>Lennon felt Levein got a raw deal after his squad was decimated by injuries to key players over the last 12 months.</p>
      <p>He said: “I’m really disappointed for him as the club meant so much to him and the job meant so much to him.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know if there was an inevitability about it based on results but there were mitigating circumstances.</p>
      <p>“He’s had a lot of important players injured since this time last year when they were flying.</p>
      <p>“You think of the long-term injuries they’ve had to Steven Naismith and John Souttar and now Craig Halkett and Conor Washington.</p>

      <p>“There’s no question that those four would make Hearts a better team.”</p>
      <p>Lennon’s focus is on his side’s Betfred Cup semi-final showdown with Hibs at Hampden this evening but he admitted he is also plotting to safeguard Celtic’s long-term future.</p>
      <p>James Forrest and Scott Bain this week penned new deals and the manager revealed he’s now determined to secure stars such as Callum McGregor and Kristoffer Ajer on extended contracts.</p>
      <p>Lennon said: “I’m very happy to get him and Scott tied up. I’m happy to be working with him for the next few years and I’m happy for him.</p>
      <p>“He’s made great progress since he’s been here, so I’m really pleased.</p>
      <p>“I’ve got three top quality goalkeepers, and I think he’ll relish the environment.</p>
      <p>“We’re talking to one or two players, so hopefully we can get those contracts over the line soon.</p>

      <p>“Callum is one of them, he’s an important player and it would be good to get him tied down too.</p>
      <p>“It’s important to have your core, and the core players here have been outstanding for the last three seasons.</p>
      <p>“Jamesy has been a fundamental part of that, as has Scott, and it just gives a feel-good factor to the club when you have boys committing themselves to the club on long-term contracts.</p>
      <p>“Kris Ajer is one we might look at.</p>
      <p>“He’s played nearly all the games since I’ve been in and I’m very happy with him as well.</p>
      <p>“These players are obviously assets too, and there will be admirers out there, no question, with the way they are playing.</p>
      <p>“So, it’s a bit of protection for us as well as settling down the players if they are getting agitated by a little bit of speculation.”</p>
