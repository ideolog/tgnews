      <p>RIYADH: Cirque du Soleil’s spectacular “Bazzar” stage show, which had its premier 12 months ago in India, arrived in Saudi Arabia on Friday to kick off a five-week run as part of Riyadh Season.</p>
      <p>As the opening-night audience entered the purpose-built white tent at Riyadh Front, they were transported to an acrobatic world of fantasy and imagination.</p>
      <p>The action on stage takes place as part of a story revolving around three main characters: The Maestro, who is the leader of troupe of performers, a mysterious “Floating Woman,” and a trainee “Mini Maestro,” who is in love with her. The three acrobats who play these characters fluttered across the stage performing mid-air flips and other impressive moves, to gasps of awe from the audience.</p>

      <p>When Lauren Joy Herley, who plays the Floating Woman, told Arab News this week that her character is a rebellious trickster, she was not exaggerating. </p>
      <p>She spent an entire act of the show tormenting the Maestro, poking and prodding him while performing stunt after stunt flawlessly, prompting the crowd to giggle at her antics. </p>
      <p>The Maestro, however, was not an easy target for her or the Mini Maestro, as he continued to lead the acrobats and musicians on stage throughout the show, casting a spell over them — and the audience.</p>
      <p>The crowd also enjoyed an interlude that included a trick cyclist, feats of strength performed on wooden poles, a trapeze act and hula hoop displays.</p>
      <p>The music was supplied by a three-piece band that delivered strong, captivating vocals, soulful melodies and energetic pop tunes as the Maestro orchestrated the glittering, colorful action, to the delight of the crowd.</p>

      <p>After the performance, Waleed Al-Bassam, a die-hard fan, said that he had been to Cirque du Soleil shows before, but it was great to have the chance to see one in Saudi Arabia.</p>
      <p>“It’s really nice,” he said. “I like the setup and how people are interacting; it gives a sense that something different is happening here in Riyadh.”</p>
      <p>Khulood Khaled who attended the show said she enjoyed the interactive elements of the show, which she hadn’t expected. She added: “I’m honestly so surprised at how people are reacting — they’re loving it.”</p>
      <p>Al-Ghala Al-Dawood, 17, who was particularly impressed by the hula hoop performer.</p>
      <p>“It made me think of physics and everything I learned in school,” she said. “He (the performer) was defying physics. It’s a new experience. I’ve never seen anything like it in Riyadh.”</p>
      <p>“Bazzar” is Cirque du Soleil’s 43rd touring show. Performances continue in Riyadh until December 7, after which the show will move on to the Caribbean.</p>
