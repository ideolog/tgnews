      <p>The <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/new-jersey">New Jersey</a> man, 50, who police say killed his parents just months before they retired from their <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/nypd-cop-in-medically-induced-coma-after-nail-salon-melee">salon</a> business, allegedly described in detail how he killed the pair, a report said.</p>
      <p>Todd S. Warner was stopped by police inside a Pennsylvania casino and questioned, NJ.com reported. The paper, citing police, reported that he told the officers that he used baseball bats—two on his mom because one broke—and tried to suffocate them. He eventually stabbed them with a knife, he allegedly said. They were both 73.</p>
