      <h1>Yesterday movie: Behind the scenes of Kate McKinnon's 'devilish' manager role</h1>
      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: Richard Curtis gives us a behind the scenes look at Kate McKinnon's role in The Beatles musical Yesterday</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T07:00:00+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 07:00</time> by <a rel="author">Lewis Knight, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/lewis-knight/</a></address>
      <p>The Beatles musical film Yesterday has revealed a look behind the role of comedic star Kate McKinnon in the film.</p>
      <p>The Saturday Night Live star plays the conniving manager Debra Hammer in the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/danny-boyle">Danny Boyle</a> film which tells the story of struggling musician Jack Malik (Himesh Patel), who awakens one day to find that the whole world - including his best friend Ellie (Lily James) - have never heard of the Beatles.</p>
      <p>Capitalising on their iconic songs, this is where Jack soon crosses paths with the eccentric Hammer.</p>
      <p>This exclusive featurette for Mirror Online sees screenwriter <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/richard-curtis">Richard Curtis</a> reveal what energy McKinnon brought to the set of the popular film, along with some words from McKinnon herself on her devilish role.</p>
      <p>The home release also includes an Alternate Opening scene and an Alternate Ending.</p>

      <p>There is also a gag reel and a whole host of deleted scenes, including Himesh Patel delivering a performance of Something.</p>
      <p>Also, look out for live sessions at Abbey Road Studios, with Patel performing the songs Yesterday, I Want To Hold Your Hand, and Let It Be.</p>
      <p>Also, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/ed-sheeran">Ed Sheeran</a> fans should keep an eye out for two featurettes featuring the singer-songwriter, with one seeing the star talk about his first movie role in the film and another being A Conversation with Richard &amp; Ed, which sees him speak with long-time friend Richard Curtis.</p>
      <p>We'll be humming <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/the-beatles">Beatles</a> tracks for a good while yet, then!</p>

        <b>Yesterday is released on 4K Ultra HD, Blu-ray, and DVD on November 4, 2019.</b>
