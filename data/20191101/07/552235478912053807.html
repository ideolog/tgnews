      <h1>Holytown MMA fighter Chris Bungard dreams of bringing Bellator to Scotland</h1>
      <h2>The lightweight will compete against Mario Saeed in London at the O2 Arena for Bellator on November 23.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T07:00:00+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 07:00</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Pirie, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/mark-pirie/</a></address>
      <p>Holytown fighter Chris Bungard is looking to bring one the biggest <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/local-sport/scots-ufc-star-paul-bearjew-20385481">mixed-martial arts</a> companies in the world to Scotland.</p>
      <p>The lightweight will compete against Mario Saeed in London at the O2 Arena for Bellator on November 23.</p>
      <p>He thinks a dominant display will allow him to put the eyes of the world on Glasgow as he eyes up a blockbuster Hydro date in the future – and repay the supporters who have followed him for his last three fights in nine months across the UK.</p>
      <p>“It’s a lot to ask fans to travel down with me, but I’m really lucky that I always get a great support,” said the 30-year-old.</p>
      <p>“It’s a long way to go for a few fights now, and after the Leary fight I owe them a performance.</p>
      <p>“I’ve had a few fight camps now and a few fights back to back, but I enjoy it. This is my job and I like being able to go and fight all the time.</p>
      <p>“My goal is to bring Bellator to Scotland.</p>
      <p>“I want to be the guy that brings it here to the Hydro.</p>
      <p>“Once I put away Mario in a spectacular way we can bring it up here.</p>

      <p>“You talk about Scotland and you always get a great atmosphere. Celtic Park, Ibrox, Hampden, these are places that have an amazing atmosphere.</p>
      <p>“If they can go to places like Dublin and sell-out they can do it here as well. Arenas will sell-out in Scotland.”</p>
      <p>He hopes that a win over his Kurdish counterpart inside the cage will help him bounce back from defeat to Charlie Leary in Newcastle earlier this year.</p>
      <p>Bungard reckons his new approach to his weight and nutrition will properly prepare him for the bout – something that didn’t happen ahead of the fight against the Englishman in June.</p>
      <p>The Scottish Hit Squad grappler has been training “two or three” times a day in the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/local-sport/scots-ufc-star-paul-bearjew-20385481">Coatbridge gym</a> alongside the likes of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/local-sport/scots-ufc-star-paul-bearjew-20385481">UFC fighter Paul ‘Bearjew’ Craig.</a></p>
      <p>“I’m looking forward to putting a beating on this guy I can’t wait to get back in there,” he said.</p>
      <p>“The defeat to Leary was definitely the hardest for me because it was on such a big stage.</p>

      <p>“It was the hardest defeat I have had to take, but also the defeat I have learned the most from.</p>
      <p>“I went in to it too heavy and had to cut too much weight in the end. I have a new nutritionist who is one of the best for MMA and I feel like I’m in great shape.</p>
      <p>“Last time I had to lose two stone before the fight and I lost the fight there.</p>
      <p>“Now everything is going great and I’m on the right track.</p>
      <p>“There is a couple of niggles but I’m enjoying my sessions. I wouldn’t be a Scottish fighter if there wasn’t a couple of bumps in the road.”</p>
      <p>Bungard, nicknamed ‘The Bad Guy’ admits he is quite similar in style to Saeed, both in his approach to a fight and inside the cage.</p>
      <p>However, he says he can already picture his win in his head, and says he won’t be able to outlast his rival.</p>

      <p>He said: “We are quite similar fighters, and be both talk a load of s**** going into a fight.</p>
      <p>“I’m really confident though. I can visualise the knee that I am going to give him.</p>
      <p>“I can see myself now putting him down with the knee, whether that is for the knock-out or just before I beat him.</p>
      <p>“I don’t see it going beyond one or two rounds. I don’t think he has the stamina to keep up with me beyond half a round</p>
