      <h1>Nearly 400 Rohingya return to Myanmar from Bangladesh, embassy says</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T07:41:34+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 07:41</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/AFP" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p>Around 400 Rohingya refugees have voluntarily returned to Myanmar from Bangladesh, Myanmar’s embassy there said Thursday, but with previous repatriation attempts having failed, Dhaka was yet verify the claim.</p>
      <p>Bangladesh is home to nearly a million Rohingya including 740,000 who fled a military crackdown in Rakhine state in August 2017 that the UN has called ethnic cleansing.</p>
      <p>Myanmar’s embassy posted photos on Facebook that purported to show “46 more voluntary returnees” being “warmly received” in Myanmar, taking the total number going back to 397 in an unspecified timeframe.</p>
      <p>There was no immediate comment on the embassy statement from the Bangladeshi refugee commissioner and Foreign Minister A.K. Abdul Momen said Dhaka would verify the claims.</p>
      <p>But in a statement on Wednesday, Bangladesh’s foreign ministry said the return of a “handful” of refugees did “not testify (to) any improvement of the ground reality in Rakhine.”</p>
      <p>Rohingya leaders have refused to return without guaranteed security and citizenship — which they are currently denied in Myanmar — and previous attempts to repatriate the Muslim minority fell flat when no-one turned up.</p>
      <p>Since then however, Bangladesh has imposed an internet blackout on the vast, squalid camps in the country’s south-east that house the refugees, and has announced plans to surround them with barbed-wire fences.</p>
      <p>Authorities also want to move thousands of the refugees to an island in the Bay of Bengal beginning next month despite concerns for their safety from rights groups.</p>
