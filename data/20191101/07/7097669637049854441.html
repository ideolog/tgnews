      <h1>Russia's MiG-29 Fulcrum: Everything You Wanted to Know</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T07:00:00+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 07:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://nationalinterest.org/" target="_blank">Sebastien Roblin</a></address>
      <p><b>Key point:</b> The MiG-29 was a very maneuverable fighter, but it had some problems too.</p>
      <p>The MiG-29 Fulcrum was the first Russian fourth-generation jet fighter, marked by its sleek and deadly appearance in contrast to earlier Soviet fighters. The fast and agile Fulcrum could outturn any NATO fighter, and it was armed with cutting-edge missiles. But, alas, it was held back by its old-fashioned electronics, short service life and limited range.</p>
      <p>In a sense, the MiG-29 combined fourth generation engineering with third generation hardware. It’s relatively low price meant it initially attracted extensive sales to developing countries, but it would swiftly become overshadowed by the more modern Su-27. The Fulcrum will remain in service for some time, however, as recent upgraded versions partially redress some of its shortcomings.</p>

      <p>The MiG-29 <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=Kt2ZaOilGXIC&amp;pg=PA179&amp;lpg=PA179&amp;dq=mig-29+fulcrum+development+1974&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vQH_aL-IN2&amp;sig=DORq9galKsHPV_nH1sj3L3IMgzU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjvj4q_8oLOAhUCGD4KHYqBCm4Q6AEIMzAE#v=onepage&amp;q=mig-29%20fulcrum%20development%201974&amp;f=false">began development</a> in 1974, intended to be an advanced lightweight multirole fighter that would operate from primitive airfields at the frontlines of the Cold War, while smaller numbers of heavier Su-27s (also then in development) would handle longer-range missions. This paralleled the light–heavy force structure of F-16s and F-15s being developed for the U.S. Air Force.</p>
      <p>The first MiG-29s became operational in 1982 and were codenamed “Fulcrums” by NATO—a name which caught on with some Russian pilots as well. The Fulcrum had a fearsome reputation in the West, and even got its own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MiG-29_Fulcrum_(1990_video_game)">computer game</a>. By the 1990s, Western pilots had ample opportunity to fly MiG-29s as the German Air Force incorporated the MiG-29s of East Germany. Later, the United States even bought twenty-one from Moldova.</p>
      <p>It was discovered that the Fulcrums <i>were</i> very hot rides—but they also had significant downsides.</p>
