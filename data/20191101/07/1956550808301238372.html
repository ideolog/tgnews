Early risers, as those who like to chomp down on boxes full of organic vegetables can tend to be, can rock up to Bay Avenue Park in <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/area-guides/business-bay">Business Bay</a> between 7am and 1pm on Friday November 1 and Saturday November 2 to stock up.<br/><br/>Clear a space in your fruit bowl today.<br/><br/>The food is grown locally by farmers and it is a delight for anybody wanting to bring some organic goodness in to their lives. The recurring event will be back in the same place and at the same time every weekend in <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/area-guides/business-bay">Business Bay</a> until May so there is no excuse not to fill up on healthier foods. We've also seen incredible organic honey and artisan doughnuts there as well, so don't be too scared by all the knobbly courgettes and mountains of kale.<br/><i>Fri-Sat, 7am-1pm.
