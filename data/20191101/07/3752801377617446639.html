      <h1>PODCAST | THE STORY: Sex, bribes and denial - Gwede Mantashe and the 'slay queen'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T07:01:00+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 07:01</time> by <a rel="author">Jerusha Sukhdeo-Raath and Nokuthula Manyathi</a></address>
      <p>"You're putting the cart before the horse," Mineral Resources and Energy Minister Gwede Mantashe said in response to a question from a journalist in Parliament about whether he intended to <b><a href="https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/sunday-world-to-gwede-mantashe-sue-us-we-stand-by-our-story-20191029">sue the Sunday World newspaper.</a></b></p>
      <p>The newspaper ran a story on Sunday <b><a href="https://www.sundayworld.co.za/news/two-ministers-bonking-one-woman/">quoting Mantashe</a>,</b> saying that he bribed two of their journalists to bury a story about his sex life. On Tuesday he released a statement <b><a href="https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/just-in-gwede-denies-paying-reporters-to-make-sex-story-go-away-20191029">denying this</a></b>.</p>
      <p>It's been a week of allegations of sex, bribes and denial by Mantashe. This week on The Story, we take you inside the allegations.</p>
