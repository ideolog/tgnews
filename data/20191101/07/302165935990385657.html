      <h1>Kit Siang: Jho Low’s settlement with DoJ a shameful ‘first’ for Malaysia</h1>

      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 1 — Fugitive businessman Low Taek Jho’s settlement deal with the United States Department of Justice (DoJ) over misappropriated 1MDB funds was a shameful first for Malaysia, DAP’s Lim Kit Siang said today.</p>
      <p>The Iskandar Puteri MP was referring to Low’s agreement to surrender US$1 billion (RM4.2 billion) in assets allegedly bought with misappropriated 1MDB funds.</p>
      <p>“Jho Low is not only the first Malaysian, but the only person in the world who could surrender US$1 billion in funds, although his action ‘does not constitute an admission of guilt, liability or any form of wrongdoing by me or the asset owners’.</p>
      <p>“But this is not an action which any Malaysian can feel proud. Malaysia must aim to be world-class but in achievements and fields where all Malaysians can feel proud.</p>
      <p>“We must not lose hope in the objective of Pakatan Harapan to achieve a New Malaysia which is to be a top world-class nation of unity, justice, freedom, excellence and integrity and we must be prepared to be assessed based on these goals — not to be a global kleptocracy or our ability to produce a Jho Low,” he said in a statement today.</p>
      <p>The DoJ announced the settlement yesterday but stressed that it did not exonerate Low or release his from future charges.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad said yesterday that Malaysia will ask the US to hand over the US$1 billion in assets recovered from Low.</p>
