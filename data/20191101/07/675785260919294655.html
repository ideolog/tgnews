      <p>Allie, 42 and Brian Anderson, 50, allegedly did not call 911 to report the overdose until more than an hour after she was dead on the night of October 21, 2017.</p>
      <p>Delaware County Sheriff Harlan Moore told local station KOTV Allie Anderson had told police she had been friends with Vermillion since they were eight years old.</p>
      <p>Police reportedly suspect the couple wanted Vermillion dead so she couldn't testify agaist them in a drug trafficking case.</p>
      <p>Moore said police recovered a video camera that police alleged was used to record Vermillion's death scene.</p>
      <p>The couple had been suspects in the case since Vermillion's death two years ago but it wasn't until a confidential informant came forward that authorities were able to lay charges.</p>
      <p>Neither of the Andersons have entered a plea.</p>
