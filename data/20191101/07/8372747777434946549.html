      <p>The US economy added 128,000 jobs in October. The unemployment rate rose slightly to 3.6%.</p>
      <p>The United States lost 36,000 manufacturing jobs last month, impacted primarily by the GM strike.</p>
      <p>Overall, the October report was stronger than expected, beating economists' far more dour forecasts. The 40-day GM strike, which took some 50,000 autoworkers out of the workforce, was <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2019/10/31/economy/october-jobs-report-gm-expectations/index.html">expected to serve as a bigger drag</a> on the employment market.</p>
      <p>The unemployment rate ticked up from 3.5% in September, but it remains near a 50-year low.</p>
      <p>Although the report was strong, hiring has slowed down in 2019 compared with 2018, averaging just 167,000 jobs per month versus 223,000 last year.</p>
      <p>Stocks didn't react much to the jobs report. Dow futures were up about 30 points.</p>
