      <p>This adorable golden retriever puppy is, in fact, a fierce predator – and to stress that fact it's wearing a dreadful shark costume with rows of razor-sharp teeth. Unfortunately, the masquerade is all in vain – the puppster is still so cute and fluffy, that no one will be scared. Some people, however, may need medical help when they see this doggo – because it’s way too cute!</p>
