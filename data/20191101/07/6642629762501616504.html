      <p>Investors could be put off <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/india.html">India</a> by Andhra Pradesh state's difficult relationship with renewable energy companies, says Sumant Sinha, chair of Goldman Sachs-backed ReNew Power.</p>
      <p>India, the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/ajimpact/190620142716327.html">world's third-largest emitter</a> of greenhouse gases, wants to <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/11/india-unveils-world-largest-solar-power-plant-161129101022044.html">raise its renewable energy capacity</a> to 500 gigawatts (GW), or 40 percent of total capacity, by 2030.</p>

      <p>The southern state of Andhra Pradesh is among the largest adopters of renewable energy, and ReNew Power - about 49 percent-owned by US investment banking giant Goldman Sachs - is India's largest renewable energy company.</p>
      <p>But the state has been curtailing power procurement from renewable energy companies, citing high prices, and pushing to renegotiate its supply contracts with them.</p>
      <p>"There are questions on what this means for sanctity of contracts in India. That has made investors jittery," Sinha told the Reuters news agency.</p>
      <p>Foreign investment is central to India's green energy ambitions, and a slowdown in overseas funding could hurt Prime Minister <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/narendra-modi-141021134051524.html">Narendra Modi</a>'s commitment to increase adoption of renewable energy.</p>
      <p>"The longer the issue carries on, the less likely [the renewable energy] target will be met," Sinha said.</p>
      <p>ReNew has an installed capacity of more than 5GW and plans to add another 3GW by mid-2021.</p>
      <p>India's federal government, the state-controlled NTPC Ltd, Solar Energy Corp of India and the Japanese ambassador to India have all asked Andhra Pradesh not to try to renegotiate renewables contracts.</p>
      <p>And in August, a court in Andhra Pradesh ordered state transmission companies to refrain from carrying out "arbitrary and discriminatory" practices towards power generating firms.</p>
      <p>Andhra Pradesh, which accounts for about 10 percent of India's renewable energy capacity, owes green energy generators 25.1 billion rupees ($353.5 million).</p>
      <p>That is the highest of any state in India and accounts for a more than a quarter of all dues owed by province-owned distribution companies, according to latest data published by the Central Electricity Authority (CEA).</p>
      <p>But Sinha said late payments by distribution companies overall was not as severe as it had been a few years ago. Along with land acquisition, delayed payments are seen as a major challenge to the growth of the renewable energy sector in India.</p>
      <p>"With the exception of states like Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, most states have started paying on time," he said.</p>
