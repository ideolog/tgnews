      <h1>Deals Spotlight: AT&amp;T Discounts 32GB Apple TV 4K to New Low of $90 (Regular $179) [Update: Sold Out]</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T07:42:29+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 07:42</time> by <a rel="author">Mitchel Broussard</a></address>
      <p>AT&amp;T today introduced a new deal on the <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/462641/type/dlg/https://www.att.com/buy/accessories/streaming-tv/apple-tv-4k-32gb-black.html?cjevent=25376d68fc8611e980d7005b0a240611&amp;source=EC1NAT10600aff12A">32GB Apple TV 4K</a> streaming box, now priced at $90, down from a regular price of $179 at Apple and other major resellers <b>($89 off)</b>. This is the lowest that we've tracked for a new model of the Apple TV 4K, and is well timed because today is also the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/11/01/apple-tv-plus-launch/">launch day</a> of Apple's new streaming service Apple TV+.</p>
