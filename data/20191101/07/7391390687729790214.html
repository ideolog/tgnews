      <p><b><i>Spoilers ahead for Episodes 1-3 of </i>The Morning Show <i>Season 1. </i></b>Daniel Henderson (Desean Terry) is not a fan of <i>Gilmore Girls.</i> In fact, he refers to it as "neo-pro life rights propaganda" and wonders, "What the hell kind of name is Lorelai?" And so, it's to his chagrin when he and his co-anchor, Alison (Janina Gavankar) are forced to watch the <a href="https://www.bustle.com/articles/196927-stars-hollow-the-musical-in-the-gilmore-girls-revival-is-the-perfect-show-for-the-quirky"><i>Gilmore Girls </i>musical in <i>The Morning Show</i></a>'s first episode.</p>
      <p>It's meant as a fun, silly aside, but unlike Daniel, there are a lot of <i>Gilmore Girls </i>fans in real life who will be pleased to know such a musical isn't outside the realm of possibility. Similar musicals have previously been staged for movies like <i>Mean Girls</i>, <i>School of Rock</i>, <i>SpongeBob Squarepants</i>, and <i>Bring It On</i>. And since the beloved mother-daughter dramedy already received a <a href="https://www.bustle.com/articles/198812-21-of-the-most-memorable-quotes-from-gilmore-girls-a-year-in-the-life">Netflix revival (2016's <i>A Year in the Life</i></a>), it seems only natural for it to come to Broadway next.</p>
      <p>Ironically, the 2016 <i>Gilmore Girls</i> revival itself contained a show about Rory and Lorelai's sleepy, New England hometown, titled <i>Stars Hollow: The Musical</i>. Mayor Taylor Doose (Michael Winters) commissioned it as a tourist attraction and invited some key townsfolk to a dress rehearsal so they could give feedback.</p>

      <p>The production, to Lorelai's horror, was over-the-top awful, including a rap section à la <i>Hamilton </i>and some truly cringeworthy acting. Most <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Gilmore-Girls-Year-Life-Stars-Hollow-Musical-42770733">viewers were equally nonplussed</a> that it took up so much screen time, but there were a few that found it charming. So, there is at least <i>some </i>interest in something bigger.</p>
      <p>"Even though it went on for awhile, I'm kind of a <a href="https://tv.avclub.com/the-weirdly-ingratiating-stars-hollow-the-musical-hits-1798189880">sucker for <i><i>Stars Hollow: The Musical</i></i></a><i><i>.</i></i> It could be my deep and abiding Sutton Foster love," Gwen Ihnat wrote for The AV Club. "The songs started to grow on me after awhile. I think whether or not you enjoyed it depends on how much a theater nerd you are (guilty)."</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, <i>The Morning Show </i>doesn't include any footage of its imaginary <i>Gilmore </i>musical (at least not in the first three episodes). But it's still fun to daydream about who they'd cast. Sutton Foster, who appeared in <i>A Year In the Life</i>'s musical, could be Lorelai, and Rory could be played by either Anna Kendrick or Vanessa Hudgens. Patti LuPone would make a great Emily, and Jonathan Groff is a shoe-in for Logan, as is Darren Criss for Jess.</p>
      <p>In fact, perhaps that's exactly who will end up on stage if <i>Gilmore Girls </i>does ever make it to Broadway. Composer Jeanine Tesori, who wrote the music for <i>A Year In the Life</i>'s musical<i>, </i>is already up to the task. "I think <a href="https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/gilmore-girls-netflix-revival-musical-episode-lauren-graham-sutton-foster-1201918943/"><i>Gilmore Girls: The Stage Musical </i>is next</a>," she told <i>Variety</i>, jokingly. "That's what I'm hoping. Fingers crossed." <i>The Morning Show</i> could be her opening.</p>
