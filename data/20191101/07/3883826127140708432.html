        <b>MP Antoinette Sandbach, who was expelled from the parliamentary Conservative Party last month, has joined the Liberal Democrats.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Remain-voting Cheshire MP was among 21 rebels who lost the Tory whip after rebelling against Boris Johnson in a bid to prevent a no-deal Brexit.</p>
      <p>She will stand as a Liberal Democrat candidate in her Eddisbury constituency in December's general election.</p>
      <p>Explaining her decision, she said the Tory Party had "moved their values".</p>
      <p>Her move makes her the eighth MP to have joined the Lib Dems this year.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Radio 4's Today programme, she said she had considered not standing for re-election.</p>
      <p>"Like many of the MPs that have stood down, I have been subjected to abuse."</p>
      <p>"It has been incredibly difficult for my family and for me. But this is a critical time in our nation's history," she said.</p>
      <p>Announcing her decision earlier, as campaigning got under way ahead of the 12 December election, Ms Sandbach said: "People have a very clear choice.</p>
      <p>"The Conservative Party offers years of uncertainty, whilst the Liberal Democrats will stop Brexit.</p>
      <p>"I will stand on my strong local record, helping to secure local investment, fighting for fair funding for our schools and to secure additional funding in local health services.</p>
      <p>"Our country deserves so much better than Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn."</p>

      <p>Ms Sandbach was not among the 10 rebels readmitted to the party last month, shortly before the Commons backed the legislation to approve the 12 December election.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, she lost a confidence vote among her local party members - she described it as "symbolic" but added that "it most likely means that I am not going to be the Conservative candidate in the next election".</p>
      <p>Contesting her Eddisbury seat as a Conservative candidate in 2017, Ms Sandbach won a near-12,000 majority over Labour, with the Lib Dem candidate third with 2,804 votes.</p>
      <p>She was among 19 former Tories who backed the prime minister's Brexit deal legislation last week but voted against his proposed three-day timetable for it to be considered in the Commons ahead of the original Brexit deadline of 31 October.</p>
      <p>Speaking after joining the Lib Dems, she said she was concerned Mr Johnson's deal was "a trap door to a no-deal Brexit".</p>
      <p>She follows MPs Sarah Wollaston, Philip Lee and Sam Gyimah to become the fifth ex-Tory to join the Lib Dems in recent months.</p>
      <p>Ex-Conservative Heidi Allen also joined the party earlier this month, after quitting the fledgling Change UK party she joined after leaving the Tories.</p>
      <p>Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson said Ms Sandbach was a "passionate campaigner" and would be a "fantastic candidate" in the election.</p>
      <p>"Her defection clearly shows that the Liberal Democrats are the strongest party of Remain and attracting support from right across the political spectrum," she added.</p>
