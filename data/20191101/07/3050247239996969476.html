      <h1>Deribit to Pay Users $1.3M After Bitcoin Price ‘Flash Crash’ to $7.7K</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T07:05:00+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 07:05</time> by <a rel="author">William Suberg</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/cryptocurrencies">Cryptocurrency</a> futures and options exchange Deribit says it will use its own money to refund users affected by an exchange rate miscalculation.</p>
      <p>In a <a href="https://twitter.com/DeribitExchange/status/1190047067365953536">tweet</a> on Nov. 1, Deribit recognized its role in the error, which occurred on Thursday and resulted in Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index">BTC</a>) trading at around $7,700.</p>
      <h3>Deribit: crash caused by “outlier” value</h3>
      <p>This, in turn, caused traders to be paid a lower price for BTC/USD sells, with Deribit calculating the losses at $1.3 million. </p>

      </p>
      <p>“Deribit will reimburse over $1.3 million in losses from the BTC index calculation data issue around 21:00:00 UTC on October 31, 2019,” it confirmed.</p>
      <p>The exchange added: </p>
      <blockquote>“The Deribit Insurance fund will not be used to cover these losses, but compensation will be covered by Deribit.”</blockquote>
      <p>In a further message, staff explained that issue came from an erroneous value which should not have been used in calculating the BTC/USD rate.</p>
      <p>“An outlier should have been excluded from the index, therefore it's refunded by the firm,” it reads.</p>
      <h3>Coinbase Pro quiet on order cancellations</h3>
      <p>At the same time as Deribit, Coinbase Pro, the high-volume trading arm of United States exchange <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/coinbase">Coinbase</a>, also appeared to encounter problems. </p>
      <p>According to various accounts including by well-known trader <a href="https://twitter.com/JacobCanfield/status/1190011818682593281">Jacob Canfield</a>, the exchange began automatically cancelling swathes of orders on Thursday. </p>
      <p>Canfield described Coinbase Pro’s order book as having “glitched out,” with an official response still to surface. </p>
      <p>Bitcoin saw periods of volatility on Thursday, reaching a high of $9,365 before reversing and <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/market-mostly-trades-sideways-as-bitcoin-price-hovers-around-9-100">abruptly dropping</a> by around 2.5% as the exchange issues hit markets.</p>
