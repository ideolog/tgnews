      <p>The South African Football Association have revealed a new logo for Banyana Banyana as they look to given the women’s team ‘their own identity’.</p>

      <p>Desiree Ellis’ side have had an exciting few years as they grow in leaps and bounds on the world stage, with the COSAFA Cup champions going on to take their place at the FIFA Women’s World Cup earlier in the year.</p>

      <p>Thembi Kgatlana’s goal against Spain will go down in history as South Africa’s first goal at a WWC, and the team left France with their heads held high after having been pitted in what many had dubbed the group of death.</p>
      <p>Now, with SAFA looking to try and take Banyana to the next level, they have decided to design a logo for the team that is separate to that of their male counterparts.</p>
      <p>On Banyana’s official Twitter account yesterday they stated, “SAFA today launched the Banyana Banyana logo in Johannesburg… Acting CEO, Russell Paul, said it was important that Banyana also have their own identity just like Bafana.”</p>
