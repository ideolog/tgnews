      <p>BEIRUT: The Islamic State militant group confirmed the death of its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in a statement on Thursday and named his replacement as Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Quraishi.</p>
      <p>“We mourn you ... commander of the faithful,” said Abu Hamza al-Quraishi — presented as the group’s new spokesman — in an audio statement.</p>
      <p>Baghdadi, who led IS since 2014 and was the world’s most wanted man, was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1513239">killed</a> in a US special forces raid in Syria’s province of Idlib on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The group also confirmed the killing in another raid the following day of the group’s previous spokesman Abu Hassan al-Muhajir.</p>
      <p>The statement said the group’s legislative and consultative body convened after the 48-year-old Iraqi-born jihadist chief’s death.</p>
      <p>“The Islamic State shura council convened immediately after confirming the martyrdom of Sheikh Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, and the elders of the holy warriors agreed” on a replacement, said the seven-minute message.</p>
      <p>Little is known about Hashimi, whose name was seldom mentioned as a possible successor the multiple times that Baghdadi was reported killed in recent years.</p>
      <p>“We don’t know much about him except that he is the leading judge of IS and he heads the Sharia committee,” said Hisham al-Hashemi, an Iraqi expert on IS.</p>
      <p>The IS spokesman also issued a stark warning to the United States, whose President Donald Trump announced Baghdadi’s death in a televised address from the White House.</p>
      <p>“He died after running into a dead-end tunnel, whimpering and crying and screaming all the way,” Trump said on Sunday, adding that Baghdadi “died like a dog”.</p>
      <p>In the new audio message, the new IS spokesman described Trump as “a crazy old man” and warned the US that the group’s supporters would avenge Baghdadi’s death.</p>
      <p>“Do not rejoice America,” he warned, “the new chosen one will make you forget the horror you have beholden ... and make the achievements of the Baghdadi days taste sweet.”</p>
      <p>The spokesman also referred to an earlier call by Baghdadi for the thousands of IS fighters held in Syrian and Iraqi prisons to be freed.</p>
      <p>Syrian Kurdish forces run prisons in northeastern Syria where they say around 12,000 IS suspects are held.</p>
      <p>Most of those prisoners are Iraqi and Syrian but the detainees also include more than 2,000 foreigners who hail from more than 50 different countries.</p>
      <h3>Symbolic impact</h3>
      <p>With aerial and logistical assistance from an international coalition led by the US, Iraqi and Syrian forces have wrested back all the territory lost to IS in 2014.</p>
      <p>Fighters from the newly-formed IS group that year swept through much of the Sunni heartland in Iraq and Syria to declare a “caliphate” that further expanded to reach roughly the size of Great Britain.</p>
      <p>Years of battles led to the elimination in 2019 of IS’ self-declared territorial “caliphate”, ending an unprecedented experiment in jihadist statehood which saw a well-organised administration mint its own currency, produce school textbooks and levy taxes.</p>
      <p>But while that entity collapsed in March in the remote eastern Syrian village of Baghouz, the organisation went underground and reverted to well-honed guerrilla tactics that continue to do damage.</p>
      <p>A recent Turkish invasion targeting the Kurdish forces that had fought against IS in Baghouz has wrought havoc in northeastern Syria, whose geopolitical map is being redrawn.</p>
      <p>IS has a very horizontal structure, analysts say, and the impact of a decapitation strike may be more symbolic than operational, leaving the group’s global jihadist brand and efficiency as an insurgency largely intact.</p>
