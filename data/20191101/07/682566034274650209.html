      <p>Las Vegas - <b>Canelo Alvarez</b> bids to add another chapter to his legacy on Saturday when he steps up two divisions to face WBO light-heavyweight champion Sergey "Krusher" Kovalev in Las Vegas.</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old Mexican middleweight king (52-1-2, 35 KOs) is regarded as the betting favourite for what is set to be a clash of youth and speed against Kovalev's experience and raw punching power.</p>
      <p>Alvarez is fighting for the first time since a unanimous decision over Daniel Jacobs in May while Kovalev successfully defended his belt with an 11th round knockout of Britain's Anthony Yarde in Russia in August.</p>
      <p>Although Alvarez has fought at multiple weight divisions, he has never before fought beyond the super-middleweight limit, where he battered Britain's Rocky Fielding into submission inside three rounds last year.</p>
      <p>Kovalev (34-3-1, 29 KOs) is likely to prove a tougher nut to crack.</p>
      <p>Even allowing for the fact that the 36-year-old has shown clear signs of ageing in some of his recent outings, the Russian remains a heavy-handed threat.</p>
      <p>"He's the best in his division, he's one of the best, that's why we chose him, to make history by fighting one of the best," Alvarez said this week.</p>
      <p>"I feel comfortable, I feel good, we'll see on Saturday how it all goes but I feel good. I trust my endurance, my strength."</p>
      <p>Although Alvarez has already shown his ability to absorb punishment, most notably in his two bruising battles with Gennady Golovkin, Kovalev's power could cause him problems.</p>
      <p>Kovalev meanwhile sees his fight with Alvarez as an opportunity to resurrect his career in the eyes of the boxing world.</p>
      <p>The Russian lost his WBA, IBF and WBO belts in back-to-back defeats to Andre Ward in 2016 and 2017, but regained a share of the title after beating Colombia's Eleider Alvarez in a rematch in February.</p>
      <p>"I'm happy," Kovalev said. "It's nice that this is the biggest call in my boxing career, and to face Canelo, I'm happy.</p>
      <p>"This is a big test for me - to prove one more time, I'm the best light heavyweight in the division."</p>
      <p>Kovalev said he expects Alvarez to adopt an aggressive tactical approach - and plans to meet fire with fire.</p>
      <p>"This fight is going to be very interesting and very difficult for both of us because we never step back, never give up," he said.</p>
      <p>"My goal is to break his strategy and use my strategy in the fight.</p>
      <p>"We're two great champions, and right now we respect each other inside and outside the ring. We will be fighting, never step back, never give up, we'll make a great fight 100%."</p>
      <p>If Kovalev manages to upset Alvarez, however, his joy may be short-lived.</p>
      <p>On November 25 he is due to stand trial in San Bernardino Superior Court on charges of felony assault by means of force likely to cause great bodily injury.</p>
      <p>The case dates back to an incident in the Californian mountain town of Big Bear last year, when Kovalev was arrested on charges of punching a woman in the face, leaving her with a broken nose and a neck injury.</p>
