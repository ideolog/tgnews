      <p><b><i>Spoilers ahead for Episodes 1-3 of </i></b><a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/jennifer-aniston-reese-witherspoons-new-series-the-morning-show-debuted-a-first-look-at-the-apple-event-video-16983171"><b>The Morning Show<i> Season 1. </i></b>Cory Ellison</a>, a network head with slimy charisma, is one of the most interesting parts of <i>The Morning Show</i>. The new Apple TV+ series is <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/anneeaston/2019/10/30/ep-kerry-ehrin-crafts-a-complicated-universal-narrative-in-apples-new-series-the-morning-show/#78c7529f59c7">loosely based on </a>Brian Stelter's 2013 book, <i>Top of the Morning: Inside the Cutthroat World of Morning TV</i>, but the cast has been pretty insistent that all of the characters are fictional — including Cory. Still, star Billy Crudup, who plays him, said he was drawn to the character exactly because he felt so familiar.</p>
      <p>"<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=268&amp;v=ZvIb_7N96zQ">[Cory] was a guy that I felt like I've seen a lot </a>in New York.... Hyper-ambitious, really aggressive, and thinks that everybody is in the middle of the game that he is playing," he said during an interview on the <i>Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon</i>. "And so he's kind of like a lion tamer, and this is the three-ring circus to him."</p>
      <p>In the show, Cory is arrogant and bold. He never gets intimidated, and in fact seems emboldened by the anarchy that he creates. Even when — after Alex (Jennifer Aniston) goes rogue and announces Bradley (Reese Witherspoon) as her new co-anchor — Cory's boss chews him out, he gleefully exclaims, "Chaos — it's the new cocaine, Fred!" According to Crudup, this is, unfortunately, because Cory tends to always be right.</p>
      <p>"Since <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q-fJB-xQf0">Cory has nothing but evidence</a> that his version of [economic] growth works, then there's no reason he shouldn't be as confident and cocky and capable of his own aptitude — which he is," the actor told BUILD Series.</p>

      <p>There's not much known about Cory's past, aside from what little he tells Bradley during their meeting in Episode 2: "What is my story? Smart kid, dad left, I took care of my mom, I vowed to own the world one day and kick everyone's ass into submission."</p>
      <p>His first agenda for UBA is to push the family narrative; his second is to force Alex (Jennifer Aniston) out. "Watching a beloved woman's breakdown is timeless, American entertainment," he says at one point, referring to Alex struggling in the aftermath of her co-host Mitch Kessler's (Steve Carell) firing.</p>

      <p>Even more disturbing is that Cory professes to be progressive and politically correct. "We're creating a safe space here. It's a feminine space," he tells his staff in the wake of the network's #MeToo scandal. "This is an era for <i>The Morning Show</i> where women make the rules and give voice to the silenced." And then, tellingly: "Speaking of which, nobody says a f*cking word to the press."</p>
      <p>No one is exactly "good" on <i>The Morning Show</i>, but in this story, it's clear that Cory is the villain, swooping in with platitudes about cleaning up the Exxon oil spill with soap and then going home with a clear conscience. And if he gets his way, Alex's days at UBA are numbered.</p>
