      <p><b>JOHANNESBURGÂ (AP)</b> - Congo's military says it has launched an offensive against rebel groups in the country's east even while efforts continue there to contain a deadly outbreak of the Ebola virus.</p>
      <p>Army spokesman Gen. Leon Kasonga announced the large-scale offensive Thursday in the Beni region, an early epicenter of the more than yearlong Ebola outbreak.</p>
      <p>The offensive primarily targets Allied Democratic Forces rebels who have killed hundreds of civilians and security forces over the past few years and recruited children in mineral-rich northeast Congo. Attacks have hampered Ebola containment efforts.</p>
      <p>The region borders Uganda and Rwanda. Congo's military offensive comes days after a meeting of regional military leaders on how to rid eastern Congo of rebel groups.</p>
      <p>But Congo's army is making clear that it is carrying out this new offensive alone.</p>
