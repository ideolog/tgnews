      <p>144 incidents were logged by 9pm.</p>

      <p>The DFB also dealt with anti-social behaviour in the city centre when rocks and fireworks were thrown at them after bins were set alight at a flat complex.</p>
      <p>Two cars were torched and a lamp post was knocked down, blocking the entrance to an estate in Fortunestown.</p>
      <p>Firefighters were called from Dolphin's Barn Station to extinguish a bonfire being used as a barricade across a road in Drimnagh.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere a car was driven onto a bonfire in Coolock, two derelict houses in Cherry Orchard and Tallaght were set alight and crews put out a fire at a portacabin in Malahide.</p>
