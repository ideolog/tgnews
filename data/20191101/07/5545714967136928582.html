      <h1>Rockstar shows off just how great Red Dead Redemption 2 looks on PC</h1>
      <h2>How many people have written it as 'Read Dead Redemption?' Can we get a LeVar Burton spinoff?</h2>

      <p>Well, it's been about a year, and now PC fans can enjoy <i>Red Dead Redemption 2</i>. After this weekend that is!</p>
      <p>Due on November 5, the PC edition sports enhanced visuals and a few minor extra bits of content, and will boast a 4K/60FPS upgrade. To wit, the new launch trailer is also 4K/60FPS, so you can get a general idea of what the game is going to look like below.</p>
      <p>Clocking in at roughly 50 hours, replaying all of <i>Red Dead 2</i> is a tall order having just finished it in the past year. Although: I can't resist giving the PC version a shot and seeing just how good it looks, and you <i>know</i> the modding community is going to go all-out.</p>
      <p>Plus, the PC version of <i>Red Dead Online</i> is likely going to be the smoothest going forward, as Rockstar inevitably focuses on next-gen ports at some point just like they did with <i>GTA V</i>. Any time invested on PC is relatively safe!</p>
