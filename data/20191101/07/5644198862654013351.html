      <p>PARIS: Dutch duo Danielle van de Donk and Vivianne Miedema both scored hat-tricks as Arsenal crushed Slavia Prague 8-0 for an 11-2 aggregate win in the UEFA Champions League last 16 on Thursday (Oct 31).</p>
      <p>Jill Roord and a Kim Little penalty compounded the misery for the Czech visitors in the second leg tie.</p>

      <p>Miedema, who scored four times in the first leg last week, now has 10 goals for the season, one ahead of Lyon's Norwegian star Ada Hegerberg.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, Lee Alexander saved three shoot-out penalties to take Glasgow to their second quarter-final after a 2-2 draw with Brondby of Denmark.</p>
      <p>Paris Saint-Germain also went into the quarter-finals as a 3-1 home win over Breidablik of Iceland gave the French side a 7-1 aggregate win.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, Hegerberg scored twice in a 7-0 win over Hjorring of Denmark to take her to a new record of 53 goals in the tournament.</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old had equalled the previous record of 51 held by Germany's Anja Mittag in the first leg which the defending champions won 4-0 earlier this month.</p>
      <p>Hegerberg, playing her 50th game in the competition, then hit the record-setting goal in the 12th minute of the second leg before adding another on the night.</p>
      <p>In the closest tie of the round, Atletico Madrid knocked out Manchester City for the second year running, to reach their first quarter-final.</p>
      <p>Level 1-1 after the first leg in Manchester last week, the Spanish side went in front five minutes from the end of the first half when City captain Steph Houghton diverted a shot from Ludmila Da Silva past her own goalkeeper.</p>
      <p>Atletico skipper Angela Sosa made it 2-0 on the night and 3-1 on aggregate in the 68th minute to make the tie safe with City substitute Pauline Bremer's goal after 88 minutes merely a consolation for the English side.</p>
      <p>Barcelona reached the quarter-finals for the fifth year running after a 3-1 win at Minsk for an 8-1 victory over the Belarusian champions.</p>
      <p>German duo Wolfsburg and Bayern Munich both completed 7-0 aggregate wins over Twente of the Netherlands and Kazygurt from Kazakhstan respectively.</p>
