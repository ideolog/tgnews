      <h3>What the papers say</h3>
      <p>Crystal Palace are interested in securing Liverpool forward <b>Rhian Brewster</b> on loan in the January window, The Sun reports. The 19-year-old forward is also being watched by Bristol City and Swansea and some German sides if he is made available on a short-term contract.<b> </b>Brewster gained the Golden Boot after he helped England win their maiden Under-17 World Cup in 2017.</p>
      <p>The 21-year-old Czech midfielder <b>Alex Kral</b> could be leaving Spartak Moscow for the Premier League, according to the Norwich Evening News. The young player’s role in the stunning 2-1 Euro 2020 defeat of England in October has marked him as a target for Norwich, Everton and Newcastle.</p>
