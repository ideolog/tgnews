      <p>SHANGHAI (Nov 1): Asian shares scaled three-month highs on Friday as a surprise bounce in Chinese manufacturing activity eclipsed doubts raised by a Bloomberg news report over whether the United States and China can reach a long-term trade deal.</p>
      <p>Shares in Europe were set to follow Asia’s lead. Pan-region Euro Stoxx 50 futures STXEc1 were up 0.28%, German DAX futures FDXc1 gained 0.34% and FTSE futures FFIc1 added 0.19%.</p>
      <p>Factory activity in China expanded at its fastest pace in more than two years in October as export orders and production rose, a private business survey showed on Friday.</p>
      <p>The expansion, which beat expectations and contrasted with the dour results of an official survey Thursday, helped to boost Chinese blue chips .CSI300, which surged 1.6%.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong's Hang Seng .HSI added 0.65% and Seoul's Kospi .KS11 rose 0.77%. The Nikkei .N225 underperformed, ending the day down 0.33%.</p>
      <p>MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS reversed early losses to touch fresh three-month highs, and was last up 0.4%.</p>
      <p>The index’s performance reflected a results season that has shown companies to be more resilient than expected, said Jim McCafferty, head of Equity Research, Asia ex-Japan at Nomura.</p>
      <p>“If you look at the micro data supplied by the companies, then it tells you that customers ... are continuing to do business. So I think that we are in a better state than perhaps investors thought we were just one month ago,” he said.</p>
      <p>Earlier on Friday, losses had mirrored falls in global stock markets, as MSCI’s gauge of equity performance in 47 countries .MIWD00000PUS fell from 20-month highs after a report that cast doubt on the likelihood of a U.S.-China trade deal.</p>
      <p>On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 0.52%, the S&amp;P 500 .SPX lost 0.30% and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 0.14%.</p>
      <p>Efforts by Washington and Beijing to end their bruising nearly 16-month trade war appeared on track as U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday said that the two sides would soon announce a new venue for the signing of a “Phase One” trade deal after Chile cancelled a planned summit set for mid-November.</p>
      <p>Optimism was dampened by a Bloomberg report citing unnamed Chinese officials airing doubts over whether a comprehensive long-term trade deal is possible.</p>
      <p>China’s doubts were “not entirely unexpected”, Greg McKenna, strategist at McKenna Macro, said in a morning note to clients, noting that the falls in equity markets overnight were relatively small.</p>
      <p>Retreats in the S&amp;P 500 and the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield indicated some technical resistance in the market, he said.</p>
      <p>“Either way, today’s deluge of manufacturing PMI’s and then U.S. non-farm (payrolls) tonight will be an important factor in where markets head next,” McKenna said.</p>
      <p>The Institute for Supply Management is due to release data from its survey of purchasing managers on Friday. A separate PMI survey released Thursday by the Chicago Fed USCPMI=ECI showed a sharper contraction in midwestern manufacturing activity for October.</p>
      <p>The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes US10YT=RR was higher at 1.6963% compared with its U.S. close of 1.691% on Thursday. The two-year yield US2YT=RR, sensitive to market expectations of Federal Reserve policy, was at 1.536%, up from a U.S. close of 1.526%.</p>
      <p>The Fed cut interest rates for a third time this year on Wednesday to help sustain U.S. growth, but signalled there would be no further reductions unless the economy takes a turn for the worse.</p>
      <p>In the currency market, the dollar was down 0.05% against the yen at 107.97 JPY=.</p>
      <p>The euro EUR= was 0.1% higher on the day at $1.1161, while the dollar index .DXY, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was down 0.12% at 97.328.</p>
      <p>U.S. crude CLc1 rose 0.28% to $54.33 a barrel and Brent crude LCOc1 inched up 0.03% to $59.64 per barrel.</p>
      <p>Spot gold XAU= eased 0.24% to $1,509.54 per ounce. [GOL/]</p>
