      <p>LEE COUNTY, Fla. â€” The Lee County Sheriffs were called about a sex crime at home in Fort Myers.</p>
      <p>The victim told a parent that the sexual abuse started when they were five years old.</p>
      <p>The man threatened the child and their family, and that is why the child did not report it.</p>
      <p>Detectives quickly began an investigation and found probable cause to arrest Antonio Becerril Soria, 44.</p>
      <p>Soria was tracked down and arrested by the Fugitive Warrants Unit.</p>
      <p>Soria was charged with Sexual Capital Battery and Lewd/Lascivious Behavior.</p>
