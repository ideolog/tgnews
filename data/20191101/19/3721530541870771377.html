      <p>Blizzard posted a teaser for its new <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/hearthstone-heroes-of-warcraft/11322"><i>Hearthstone</i></a><i> </i>expansion on social media before following it up with a full reveal at BlizzCon 2019. The next <i>Hearthstone</i> expansion, <i>Descent of Dragons</i>, will conclude the story started with <i>Rise of</i><i> Shadows</i> and <i>Saviors of Uldum.</i> This tale is wrapped up in a very <i>Flash Gordon</i> candy shell, with an accompanying music video.</p>
      <p>This expansion takes us to Dragonblight, a zone from <i>World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King</i>. Dragonblight is up in snowy Northrend, and it’s where the Dragon Aspects gather near their shrines. There are also lots of dead dragons, so we can expect some potentially spooky cards ... like Galakrond, the massive skeleton that dominates the landscape of Dragonblight.</p>

      <p>Galakrond is a hero card that can replace any existing class, with his own hero power and battlecry.</p>
      <p>The new keyword for <i>Descent of Dragons</i> is Invoke. Playing Invoke cards will strengthen Galakrond, upgrading him to a second, more deadly form, and then finally, Galakrond, Azeroth’s End.</p>
      <p><i>Rise of Shadows</i> was about the League of EVIL, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/3/14/18265840/hearthstone-rise-of-shadows-expansion-cards-release-date">a group of supervillains from previous <i>Hearthstone</i> expansions</a>, and their theft of the magical city of Dalaran. From there, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/8/2/20732539/hearthstone-saviors-of-uldum-design-quests-environment-lore">the story headed to Uldum</a>, where the League of Explorers fought back. Both expansions came with single-player campaigns. Now, it looks like players get to finally make a choice between good and evil.</p>
      <p><i>Descent of Dragons</i> is set to conclude Year of the Dragon. Changes to the standard format of the game will follow, with older cards being put into the Wild rotation. The expansion will go live on Dec. 10.</p>
