      <p>ECHO PARK, LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- Three people were killed and another was in stable condition Friday after a police pursuit ended in a crash just off the 101 Freeway in Echo Park.<br/><br/>The SUV rolled over just after 4 a.m. following a chase involving Los Angeles police, according to the Los Angeles Fire Department.<br/><br/>LAPD spokesman Drake Madison said officers had been pursuing one of the three burglary suspect vehicles for about three minutes when the car rolled over.<br/><br/>Officials say pursuing officers and a police helicopter lost sight of the vehicle, and moments later, police located the overturned SUV near the Echo Park off-ramp.<br/><br/>Firefighters worked to free the four suspects, all said to be between 20 and 30 years old. Three were pronounced dead at the scene and a fourth was taken to an area hospital.<br/><br/>"Just by looking at how the vehicle looks, possibly the vehicle tried to take the off-ramp maybe too fast and lost control," a California Highway Patrol spokesperson said.<br/><br/>The northbound on- and off- ramps at Rampart Boulevard were closed by California Highway Patrol during the investigation. Traffic was not significantly impacted during the morning rush hour.<br/><br/>Police are still looking for the suspects who fled in the other two vehicles.<br/><br/><i>The Associated Press contributed to this story.</i></p>
