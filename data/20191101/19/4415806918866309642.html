      <p>The 39 migrants found dead in the back of a lorry in England are believed to be Vietnamese nationals, Essex police has said.</p>
      <p>Assistant Chief Constable Tim Smith said this evening: “At this time, we believe the victims are Vietnamese nationals, and we are in contact with the Vietnamese Government.</p>
      <p>“We are in direct contact with a number of families in Vietnam and the UK, and we believe we have identified families for some of the victims whose journey ended in tragedy on our shores.”</p>
      <p>“The confirmatory evidence needed to formally present cases to HM Senior Coroner for her consideration has not yet been obtained.</p>
      <p>“This evidence is being gathered across a number of jurisdictions worldwide. As a result, we cannot at this time announce the identity of any of the victims.”</p>
