A <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fmicrosoft.msafflnk.net%2Fc%2F159229%2F433017%2F7593%3FsubId1%3DUUacUdUnU81897YYw%26subId2%3Dthrifter%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.microsoft.com%252Fen-us%252Fstore%252Fb%252Fblack-friday%252F%253Fmnsid%253Dthrifter&amp;token=GJrRbEKi">sneak peek of its Black Friday deals</a> was just released so we can get a glimpse of what to expect, and a few of these deals should not be missed! Microsoft is making it easier to shop online this year too, which we'll get into below.</p>
      <h3>Deals worth considering</h3>
      <p>Anyone looking to buy a Surface Pro or Surface Laptop this holiday season will be stoked to learn that there are multiple deals worth considering during Black Friday. Microsoft has a bunch of other great deals to choose from on HP laptops, Samsung Galaxy phones, and more, though some are a bit better than others. We've picked out a few of our favorites below:</p>

      <h3>Deals worth ignoring</h3>
      <p>Spending your money wisely on Black Friday is just as important as it is on any other day. While Microsoft's sneak peek is full of great offers, every Black Friday ad has a few deals inside that are worth ignoring. Sometimes it's because the item is not discounted as heavily as the ad makes it appear to be, other times it's because the item can be found at a better price elsewhere. It always helps to do a bit of research beforehand on the products you're interested in. Below are just a few items you shouldn't stress about buying during the event:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Samsung Galaxy Buds - $119.99</li>
        <li>Dell 24 Touch Monitor (P2418HT) - $249</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Store information</h3>
      <h4>Get the latest Black Friday deals delivered straight to your inbox!</h4>
      <p>Most of Microsoft's Black Friday deals start on Thanksgiving Day, November 28 at 12AM ET, though a number of deals worth watching start prior to that on November 22. <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fmicrosoft.msafflnk.net%2Fc%2F159229%2F433017%2F7593%3FsubId1%3DUUacUdUnU81897YYw%26subId2%3Dthrifter%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.microsoft.com%252Fen-us%252Fstore%252Flocations%252Ffind-a-store%253Fmnsid%253Dthrifter&amp;token=IF5bKLvI">Select Microsoft stores</a> will be open on Thanksgiving Day. This is only a sneak peek at the deals Microsoft will be offering later this month, so it's likely we'll see a full ad from Microsoft show up closer to the big event. Microsoft's Give Wonder Guarantee is new this year, allowing you to receive savings back from the store if you notice an item you purchase has dropped in price at anytime during the holiday season. The online store is also offering free 2-3 day express shipping as well as extended return times through January 31, 2020.</p>
