      <h1>Jane Fonda Arrest Watch: The Actress Is Off to Jail for the Fourth Week in a Row</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T19:23:40+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 19:23</time> by <a rel="author">Jordan Crucchiola</a></address>
      <p>Jane Fonda has been getting marched away from Capitol Hill in zip-tie cuffs a lot lately as she protests government inaction on climate change. Though Fonda <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/jane-fonda-arrested-interview.html">just told Vulture</a> she “may not get arrested <i>every</i> Friday,” she was careful to add, “but maybe a few more times.” Fittingly, the actress was taken in again this afternoon by police. It’s her fourth arrest in as many weeks as she fulfills her pledge to make a ruckus every Friday (“Fire Drill Fridays”) about the climate in Washington, D.C. This time, she was joined by Catherine Keener and Rosanna Arquette, who join her previous arrest co-stars, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/jane-fonda-sam-waterston-arrested-climate-protest.html">Sam Waterston</a> and <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/jane-fonda-ted-danson-arrested-climate-change-protest.html">Ted Danson</a>. Fonda reportedly faces an overnight stay in jail this time since, as she explained to press, this latest arrest comes before her court date for <i>last </i>week’s arrest.</p>
      <p>Her response? Per <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/jane-fonda-climate-protests-1202774639/">Deadline</a>, a facetious “Oh! What will I do?” Fonda continued: “Yes. I probably will go to jail tonight. It will not be the first time. And I am prepared to do that. And maybe I won’t. It’s kind of arbitrary. I was told that if I got arrested before my court date, I would probably go to jail. One night. Big deal.” Today, protesters marched to the Hart Senate Office Building, the same building where Amy Schumer was arrested last year <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/10/kavanaugh-protest-washington-dc-celebrities-arrested.html">while protesting</a> Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court nomination. Fonda has committed to her Fire Drill Fridays through mid-January, when she will come back home to L.A. to keep making <i>Grace and Frankie</i>. In other activism news, James Cromwell was <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/james-cromwell-arrested-during-peta-protest-at-texas-am-2019-10-31/">arrested during</a> a PETA protest at Texas A&amp;M earlier today. It is quite literally cuffing season.</p>
