      <p>An EastEnders insider said: "Keanu should know that secrets never stay secret in Walford and he's been playing with fire for months.</p>
      <p>"The truth is going to come out in spectacular fashion and bosses are promising that Keanu's exit is going to be explosive."</p>
      <p>Phil will discover that his daughter's boyfriend, who he welcomed into the family and added to his will, betrayed him in the worst possible way.</p>

      <p>EastEnders' executive producer Jon Sen added: "Keanu's story is set to come to a dramatic and blistering conclusion in the near future as one of the best kept secrets on the Square is finally revealed with devastating consequences.</p>
      <p>"We'd all like to thank Danny for his nuanced performance as Keanu Taylor over the last two and half years.</p>
      <p>"What Danny has brought to his character has been one of the reasons the 'Sheanu' affair has been such compulsive viewing for fans.</p>
      <p>"Everyone at EastEnders wishes him well for the future."</p>

      <p>Keanu will soon be found out after getting Sharon pregnant behind husband Phil Mitchell's back during a dramatic festive special.</p>
      <p>During an exclusive chat with Mirror Online at the Inside Soap Awards, Danny said: "It’s going to explosive, like classic Christmas Day.</p>
      <p>"There’s a lot of involvement of Keanu and Sheanu storyline. And it’s been going for a while, the Sheen storyline and you see different elements to the relationship - when he’s been tied to the bed with pink fluffy handcuffs and you’ve seen him when he’s tied to a warehouse, threatened to kill him.</p>

      <p>"So yeah, there’s been different elements and it’s been a rollercoaster ride. But as we know, at some point it will be revealed. And when it does get revealed, it’s going to have such a massive impact on the Square on Keanu and Sharon and Louise and Phil and so many characters. So the repercussions are humungous."</p>
      <p>The episode is set to be packed with twists and turns and could be as thrilling for viewers as last year's videotape reveal of Stacey and Max's affair.</p>
      <p>Danny told us: "I don’t know who it’s going to be revealed but it’s going to be a very smart, clever… it might not be obvious, it could be something very subtle."</p>
