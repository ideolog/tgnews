      <p>The late pop star – who died in 2009 aged 50 following an overdose of the anaesthetic propofol – topped Forbes’ 2019 list after his estate made over £46 million in the last 12 months.</p>
      <p>The news comes despite the controversy that followed the release of <a href="https://www.nme.com/tag/leaving-neverland?_ga=2.36538528.1800883736.1572459283-1658358131.1564010343"><i>Leaving Neverland</i></a> earlier this year. The Dan Reed-directed documentary, which <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/leaving-neverland-divides-viewers-uk-premiere-2458202">divided viewers upon its UK airing</a>, focuses on testimony by Wade Robson, 36, and James Safechuck, 41, who both claim that Jackson sexually abused them when they were children.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackomalleygreenburg/2019/10/30/the-top-earning-dead-celebrities-of--2019/#8aa24784e5e8"><i>Forbes</i></a>, Jackson’s streaming numbers “surged” despite the scandal, to “2.1 billion US spins, up from 1.8 billion a year ago.”</p>
      <p>“With proceeds flowing from his Mijac Music catalogue, a Las Vegas show and a long-term deal with Sony, he retains his post mortem cash crown for the seventh consecutive year,” <i>Forbes</i> reports.</p>
      <p><a href="http://nme.com/artists/elvis-presley">Elvis Presley</a> came in at second in the list, which measures pre-tax income from October 1, 2018 to October 1, 2019. The ‘Hound Dog’ singer made over £30 million in the past year.</p>
      <p>Cartoonist Charles Schulz was third with £29 million, golfer Arnold Palmer was fourth with £23 million and <a href="http://nme.com/artists/bob-marley">Bob Marley</a> came in at fifth with over £15 million.</p>
      <p><a href="http://nme.com/artists/nipsey-hussle">Nipsey Hussle</a>, who was <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/rapper-nipsey-hussle-reportedly-shot-2469497">shot and killed earlier this year</a>, was in 10th place with over £8 million. Rapper XXXTentacion – who <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/xxxtentacion-reportedly-shot-in-miami-2340607">died after being shot in 2018</a> – was in 11th place after making close to £8 million.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/michael-jacksons-son-prince-says-can-still-feel-fathers-guidance-2562152#O8f0Mcupdz4JQGZl.99">Michael Jackson’s son, Prince, has said he can still feel the “guidance” of his father.</a></p>
      <p>Speaking to <i>Extra</i> <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/michael-jackson-sons-prince-jackson-bigi-blanket-jackson-youtube-movie-review-channel-taj-jackson-avengers-endgame-2488811#kBepsTKwpZzc6Tr0.99">about the YouTube film review channel he and his brother launched recently,</a> Prince Jackson said that Michael “always” wanted him and his siblings to “chase their dreams”.</p>
