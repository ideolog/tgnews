      <h1>Lady Gaga Will Star in a Movie About the Murder of Gucci Founder's Grandson</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T19:17:00+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 19:17</time> by <a rel="author">Savannah Walsh</a></address>
      <p>Lady Gaga has found her follow-up film to 2018's <i>A Star Is Born</i>. <i><a href="https://variety.com/2019/film/news/lady-gaga-gucci-murder-movie-ridley-scott-1203390294/">Variety</a> </i>reports that the Oscar winner will star in a movie about the murder of Gucci founder Guccio's grandson, Maurizio Gucci.</p>
      <p>Ridley Scott (<i>Gladiator, The Martian</i>) will direct and produce the film, which casts Gaga as Patrizia Reggiani, the ex-wife of Maurizio. In 1998, Reggiani was convicted of ordering a hit man to murder her ex-husband, who was an heir to the Gucci empire, on his office steps, per <i><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/04/world/former-wife-given-29-years-for-ordering-gucci-slaying.html">The New York Times</a>. </i>The couple shared two daughters together before Maurizio allegedly left Reggiani for a younger woman. According to <i>Times </i>reporting, Reggiani became known by the Italian press as "The Black Widow" during the high-profile trial. She served 18 years of a 29-year prison sentence before being <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/02/10/italys-black-widow-entitled-nearly-1-million-year-despite-ordering/">released in 2016</a> for good behavior.</p>
      <p>Per <i>Variety</i>, the movie will be written by Roberto Bentivegna and based on the book, <i>The House of Gucci: A Sensational Story of Murder, Madness, Glamour, and Greed </i>by Sara Gay Forden.</p>

      <p>This will be the first major acting project for Gaga since her star turn in the Bradley Cooper-directed movie, <i>A Star Is Born.</i> At the 2019 Oscars, the musician won an Oscar for Best Original Song for writing, "Shallow," alongside Mark Ronson. Gaga was also nominated that night in the Best Actress category.<i> </i>Since then, she's kept busy by <a href="https://www.elle.com/beauty/makeup-skin-care/a28365634/lady-gaga-haus-laboratories-products-first-look/">launching her own makeup line</a>, <i>Haus Laboratories, </i>and performing during her <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a26052058/lady-gaga-bradley-cooper-shallow-law-vegas/">Las Vegas residency</a>.</p>
