      <h2>The pet needed treatment after being bitten by a Noble False Widow spider which can be found in Scotland.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T19:39:24+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 19:39</time> by <a rel="author">Aengus O'Hanlon</a></address>
      <p>A dog has been attacked by a <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/glasgow-man-says-unlikely-friendship-20743039">venomous spider</a> in the exact same spot where a woman was bitten a week before.</p>
      <p>The pet needed treatment from a vet following the incident involving a <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/glasgow-man-says-unlikely-friendship-20743039">Noble False Widow</a> spider.</p>
      <p>It comes after there were a number of sightings of the creatures in the area where the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/glasgow-man-says-unlikely-friendship-20743039">dog</a> 's owner was attacked just a week prior.</p>
      <p>A veterinary clinic is now urging <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/glasgow-man-says-unlikely-friendship-20743039">dog</a> owners to take care due to a rise in the number of venomous spiders.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Sandycove Veterinary Clinic in Dublin told how a client visited their premises with their pooch, <a href="https://www.dublinlive.ie/news/dublin-news/venomous-spider-attacks-dog-killiney-17177738">Dublin Live</a> reports.</p>
      <p>They posted: "We are asking all of our clients to take extra caution when walking with their dogs.</p>
      <p>"One client brushed paths with this little guy on her travels in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/glasgow-man-says-unlikely-friendship-20743039">Killiney Hill</a> in the last week and received quite a nasty looking bite on her leg, which swelled up massively and required urgent treatment.</p>
      <p>"Today, her dog was bitten in the exact same spot on a walk.</p>
      <p>"False Widow spiders have made Ireland their home in the past couple of years, they are <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/glasgow-man-says-unlikely-friendship-20743039">venomous</a> and their bites can be extremely painful."</p>
      <p>Noble False Widow spiders can be found in Scotland. There have been a number of sightings in Aberdeen, South Lanarkshire and as far north as Orkney.</p>
      <p>South Dublin locals have reported many sightings of the venomous spider in recent months - although there are no indications if they're male or female (the female bite has a stronger sting).</p>
      <p>The arachnids have been sparking panic across Ireland, with reports earlier this summer of people suffering bites in Waterford and Kilkenny.</p>
      <p>It seems that the creepy crawlies are making more and more appearances in the Irish <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/glasgow-man-says-unlikely-friendship-20743039">capital</a> .</p>
      <p>Some even said that most of the spiders they see are the false widow.</p>
      <p>One <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/glasgow-man-says-unlikely-friendship-20743039">woman</a> said: "They are very common here now.. I've so many in my garden and they like to come into the house alot!"</p>
      <p>While a man added: "I’d say 6 out of 10 spiders I come across in garden and shed are these guys."</p>
      <p>It seems that they still have a tendency to bite, with many warning against the infection that comes with it.</p>
      <p>One man said: "Be very careful of them, I got a bite from one, when I was asleep. It got infected and I had to go on antibiotics for two weeks. They are vicious !"</p>
      <p>While another added: "Got a bite from one of these. <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/glasgow-man-says-unlikely-friendship-20743039">VERY sore</a> and lasted for weeks."</p>
      <p>And it seems that a bite is not the only risk - as the spiders like to play mind games.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Another woman said: "One on the wall of our house last year jumped at me and kept swinging towards me on a strand of web - terrifying!</p>
      <p>"He made quite a mess when I eventually squashed him!"</p>
      <p>Experts have warned that while a bite from a False Widow can’t kill people, it can result in intense pain and discomfort for a number of days.</p>
      <p>Symptoms of a false widow bite include swelling, itchiness, and irritation of the skin.</p>
      <p>In rare cases, some people can have a serious allergic reaction to the bite.</p>
      <p>It’s important to get immediate medical attention and see your <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/glasgow-man-says-unlikely-friendship-20743039">GP</a> if  you’ve been stung especially if there’s a lot of swelling and pus which indicates an infection.</p>
