      <h2>Lorraine Hankins on what makes the town special</h2>

      <p>For local resident Lorraine Hankins, Stettler is rich in community spirit.</p>
      <p>“I was born and raised in Northern Alberta and came to Stettler in 1996. I immediately felt welcomed into the community as people were so friendly,” said Hankins – executive director of the Stettler Information and Referral Centre.</p>
      <p>Relocating to Stettler indeed proved a natural fit.</p>
      <p>“I was born and raised in a small town, so I also love the small town feel of Stettler, from the friendly businesses to the ease of getting around and using landmarks to give directions!</p>
      <p>“I love the sense of community spirit that is here – when there is a need, the residents come together to help one another out, often going beyond to ensure the need is met.</p>
      <p>“We also have a great volunteer base in our not-for-profits, charities, sports clubs, service organizations, etc. that commit thousands of hours to the benefit of our community.”</p>
      <p>Hankins knows plenty about community involvement on a number of fronts. It’s fulfilling to be helping out in any number of ways, she has noted.</p>
      <p>“It’s nice to see smiles on people’s faces when you have accomplished something with them. With some clients, it’s taken us two years to get a permanent resident card or tackle whatever barriers they’ve got. But we stick with it, and when it’s all done, it’s very fulfilling to know you have made a difference. Or to see people who are struggling financially get approved for programs and then tell you their freezer is full and they are able to save money for their children.</p>
      <p>“To make differences in people’s lives is very fulfilling.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, for Hankins, there truly is everything one could need right here.</p>
      <p>“We have many opportunities for recreation which we continue to build upon with the facilities that we have in both the Town and the County of Stettler. I have raised my family here, made many great friends and memories and would do it all over again!</p>
      <p>“Stettler is the ‘Heart of Alberta’ and we definitely demonstrate it in every sense of the word.”</p>
