      <p>The All Blacks bid farewell to coach Steve Hansen and captain Kieran Read with a 40-17 victory over Wales at Tokyo Stadium on Friday, claiming the one World Cup prize that no team sets out to win - third place.</p>
      <p>TOKYO: The All Blacks bid farewell to coach Steve Hansen and captain Kieran Read with a 40-17 victory over Wales at Tokyo Stadium on Friday, claiming the one World Cup prize that no team sets out to win - third place.</p>
      <p>Winger Ben Smith grabbed a brace and Joe Moody, Beauden Barrett, Ryan Crotty and Richie Mo'unga also crossed as New Zealand rebounded from their semi-final loss to England and extended their 66-year winning streak over Wales to 31 tests.</p>

      <p>Both teams came to play and Wales, also saying farewell to coach Warren Gatland, ran the ball at every opportunity to score tries through fullback Hallam Amos and Josh Adams - a Welsh record seventh of the tournament for the winger.</p>
      <p>South Africa, who beat Wales in the other semi-final last weekend, face off against England in the final at Yokohama International Stadium on Saturday.</p>
      <p>"It was just important we came back and honoured the jersey and the fans and put that one last week behind us," said Hansen.</p>
      <p>"We've played good footy throughout, but one bad game and you're out. That's knockout footy. Really proud of the boys."</p>
      <p>While pundits and fans had questioned the relevance of a third-placed playoff, both sides said the game was an opportunity to bury the demons of their semi-final losses.</p>
      <p>It was also still a test between traditional rivals, with the All Blacks boasting a winning streak against Wales that stretches back to 1953.</p>
      <p>Read and fellow veterans Crotty, Smith and Sonny Bill Williams, who were all playing their final games for the All Blacks, were superb as New Zealand built a 35-10 lead early in the second half.</p>
      <p>The All Blacks threatened from the outset and scored a fifth-minute try from prop Moody, an example of how they can play when their ball handling and running into space clicks.</p>
      <p>Fullback Barrett extended the lead to 14-0 less than eight minutes later when he took an inside pass from scrumhalf Aaron Smith before Wales had their best period of the match.</p>
      <p>Gatland's side abandoned the dour game they had played against South Africa last week and were prepared to spread the ball wide, with fullback Hallam Amos ghosting on to a long pass after 15 phases to give Wales their first try.</p>
      <p>"Our boys never gave up and tried to play some good rugby but probably a game too far for us," said Gatland. "I've loved my time in Wales but that era's over now and I'm looking forward to the next challenge."</p>
      <p>Rhys Patchell added a penalty to reduce the gap to 14-10 before Ben Smith crossed twice, first by fending off Adams and then racing away outside the defenders after a long pass from his scrumhalf, to give the All Blacks a 28-10 halftime lead.</p>
      <p>Crotty crossed after another Williams offload two minutes into the second half while Smith added what he thought was a third try, before referee Wayne Barnes called it back for a knock-on earlier in the buildup.</p>
      <p>Wales then built back into the game and Adams burrowed over after another sustained and controlled period of play to eclipse Shane Williams's six-try haul at the 2007 tournament.</p>
      <p>"We tried to play a bit but the score probably didn't reflect that," said Wales captain Alun Wyn Jones. "I think most of the squad earned their first caps under (Gatland), his legacy is a lot bigger than one game."</p>
