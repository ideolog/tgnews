      <p>PARIS (CNN) - The <a href="https://cnn.com/travel/article/new-unesco-world-hertitage-sites-2019/index.html">United Nations' cultural agency</a> has been criticized for covering up the genitalia of a series of<a href="https://cnn.com/travel/gallery/top-nude-beaches-photos/index.html"> nude </a><a href="https://cnn.com/style/article/jeff-koons-paris-attacks-sculpture-scli-intl/index.h">sculptures</a> with underwear.</p>
      <p>Works by French sculptor St√©phane Simon, which show nude, classical-style figures taking <a href="https://cnn.com/travel/article/woman-selfie-cruise-royal-caribbean-intl-scli/index.html">selfies</a>, were being displayed in Paris during UNESCO's European Heritage Days event in September.</p>
      <p>But officials decided to cover the offending parts of the artworks with underwear, to the shock of Simon and the ridicule of arts commentators.</p>
      <p>Simon told CNN the clothing was "disgusting" and said the experience left him "humiliated."</p>
      <p>"I felt ashamed, so deeply sad to see alltheseyears of work and research broken," he added. "For two days visitors came to meet, to ask me: 'But why did you do that?' But it was not my choice."</p>
      <p>The artworks, part of a project called "In Memory of Me," had been designed to comment on the spread of the selfie in recent years.</p>
      <p>"I should have spent two days explaining the fascinating link" between the practice of selfie-taking and Ancient Greek history, Simon added.</p>
      <p>He said he had raised the issue of nudity during planning meetings with UNESCO before the event, but had not been asked to cover up the works until a few days before the sculptures were displayed and had no time to amend the pieces appropriately.</p>
      <p>UNESCO has not responded to CNN's request for comment, but the UK's Times newspaper quoted a spokesperson saying: "We didn't want to censor the artist, and understand that he felt hurt."</p>
      <p>Simon added to CNN that the organization has recognized a "mistake made by one employee."</p>
