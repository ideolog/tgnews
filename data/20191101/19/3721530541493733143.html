      <p><a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/overwatch/37910"><i>Overwatch</i></a><i> </i>players got to see the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/1/20940362/overwatch-2-release-date-blizzcon-2019">unveiling of <i>Overwatch 2</i></a> at BlizzCon 2019, with a new cinematic showing <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/1/20942230/blizzcon-2019-hero-announcement-sojourn-echo">new heroes like Sojourn</a>, and fancy new looks for all of our classic characters from the first game. But this raises an obvious question: what about all of your skins, sprays, victory poses, and play of the game highlights?</p>
      <p>All of these things will be coming into <i>Overwatch</i><i> 2</i>; player progression will be saved, and players will be able to access their entire library of content from <i>Overwatch</i>. That means your holiday skins and special emotes will be accessible from day one.</p>
      <p>This transfer between games goes both ways; <i>Overwatch</i> players will get access to all of <i>Overwatch 2</i>’s PVP content for free. <i>Overwatch 2</i>’s new exclusive features seem limited to things like hero missions, story content, and more.</p>
      <p>We’ll have more info on <i>Overwatch 2</i> as BlizzCon 2019 progresses, but we know new heroes will be coming to the game after Sojourn’s introduction.</p>
      <p>In short, <i>Overwatch 2</i> is less like a standalone sequel and more like a giant expansion that builds on the first game. For those who have put a lot of time into <i>Overwatch</i>, they can rest knowing that their skins won’t be lost in the process.</p>
