      <p>LONDON, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Treasures from the tomb of boy-king Tutankhamun will go on show in London from Saturday as part of what organisers say will be their last world tour before they return to Egypt for good.</p>
      <p>More than 150 items - from statues and sculptures to a silver trumpet and a funerary bed - will be exhibited in "Tutankhamun: Treasures of the Golden Pharaoh", at the capital's Saatchi Gallery.</p>
      <p>Other exhibits include a wooden ceremonial shield, linen gloves and a life-size statue of the king that stood guard at the entrance of his last resting place.</p>
      <p>"The reason we are here, we are celebrating almost 100 years since the time of the discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamun," exhibition curator Tarek El Awady told Reuters.</p>
      <p>"It is the first time Egypt allowed this number of artefacts to leave the country ... This is the last travelling exhibition of Tutankhamun."</p>
      <p>More than 60 of the items have left Egypt for the first time, the gallery says.</p>
      <p>The tomb of the 18th dynasty king was discovered by British archaeologist Howard Carter in the Valley of the Kings in Luxor in 1922. It contained about 5,000 artefacts.</p>
      <p>London is the third of 10 cities hosting the exhibition after successful runs in Paris and Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>The items will eventually return to Egypt, where they will be put on display at the Grand Egyptian Museum, scheduled to open next year next to the Giza Pyramids.</p>
      <p>"Tutankhamun: Treasures of the Golden Pharaoh" runs at London's Saatchi Gallery until May 3, 2020. (Reporting by Iona Serrapica; Writing by Marie-Louise Gumuchian; Editing by Andrew Heavens)</p>
