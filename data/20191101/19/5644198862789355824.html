      <p>REUTERS: Bournemouth's goal drought in the Premier League is not a matter of concern for manager , Eddie Howe who has backed his attack to find form and is focusing on the positives such as consecutive clean sheets.</p>
      <p>Bournemouth last scored in a 2-2 draw with West Ham United last month and went through October without finding the net in three matches, which included a 1-0 defeat by Arsenal and goalless draws with Norwich City and Watford.</p>

      <p>"In two of the last three games we've had really good chances, the Norwich game was a bad day in front of goal. But I back my attacking players," Howe told a news conference on Friday (Nov 1) ahead of Saturday's match against Manchester United.</p>
      <p>"The clean sheets are a huge positive for us and something we needed. To be truly successful we have to tighten up defensively and the players have done really well."</p>
      <p>United are seventh with 13 points - the same as ninth-placed Bournemouth - and Howe said it was crucial to get the home support buzzing if they were to get a result and leapfrog their opponents.</p>
      <p>"Manchester United have played very well recently, they have quality players and a manager that's given them real stability," Howe said.</p>
      <p>"We have to show more than our last home game and get the supporters on our side for this one."</p>
      <p>United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has stuck with his young guns in many games this season but Howe is not far behind, with players such as 21-year-old goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale and striker Dominic Solanke, 22, featuring in every game so far.</p>
      <p>"We pride ourselves in giving young players an opportunity," Howe added. "I think that our young players will only continue to get better. A lot of them have very bright futures."</p>
