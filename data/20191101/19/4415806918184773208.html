      <p>The Independent TD Michael Healy-Rae has declined to comment following a report he was attending a funeral in South Kerry in June 2018 while signed into the Dáil for a key address by EU leader Jean-Claude Juncker.</p>
      <p>It is understood the Kerry TD attended a funeral in Sneem on the morning the European Commission president was in the Dáil.</p>
      <p>Attendance reports compiled by the Oireachtas for June 21, 2018, show he still managed to clock in at Leinster House.</p>
      <p>Mr Healy-Rae’s parliamentary assistant and son Jackie Healy-Rae was asked in Tralee on Friday if there would be a comment on the matter.</p>
      <p>He said he himself would not comment on the matter and his father would be making no comment.</p>
      <p>Last year the matter of the TD's absence from the Dail during the visit by EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker on Thursday, June 21 was debated on Radio Kerry.</p>
      <p>The issue arose after the Kerry Fianna Fáil TD John Brassil said Mr Healy-Rae was chair of the Oireachtas Committee on European Affairs and he should have been at the address and accused Mr Healy-Rae of snubbing the affair.</p>
      <p>But Mr Healy-Rae said at the time he was absent from the Dáil because of a bereavement.</p>
      <p>An uncle of his son-in-law’s had sadly passed away, Mr Healy-Rae told Radio Kerry on June 22, 2018.</p>
