      <p>MOSCOW: A controversial law that would allow Russia to cut internet traffic from international servers came into force Friday (Nov 1), prompting fears from rights activists of online isolation.</p>
      <p>The law, which President Vladimir Putin signed in May, requires Russian internet providers to install technical devices provided by the authorities to enable centralised control of traffic.</p>

      <p>They will also filter content to prevent access to banned websites.</p>
      <p>Supporters of the legislation say the aim is to ensure Russian sites keep working if they are unable to connect to international servers or in the case of a threat from abroad such as cyber attacks.</p>
      <p>But rights activists say it is another censorship bid following previous efforts in Russia to block services such as the LinkedIn social media site and the Telegram messenger service.</p>
      <p>Human Rights Watch warned that the law means the "Russian government will gain even greater control over freedom of speech and information online".</p>
      <p>
        <b>'DIRECTLY CENSOR CONTENT'</b>
      </p>
      <p>The internet is the country's main forum for political debate and opposing voices as well as coordinating opposition demonstrations.</p>
      <p>"Now the government can directly censor content or even turn Russia's internet into a closed system without telling the public what they are doing or why," said HRW's deputy Europe and Central Asian editor Rachel Denber.</p>
      <p>The bill prompted thousands of people to join street protests in Moscow and other cities in March, with some comparing it to China's Great Firewall, which heavily restricts internet access.</p>
      <p>The Kremlin has insisted it has no desire to isolate Russian internet users.</p>
      <p>"No one is suggesting cutting the internet," spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said, accusing protesters of suffering from "delusions."</p>
      <p>The bill's authors say the aim is to protect the country's websites from external threats and ensure the functioning of the internet is "safe and stable."</p>
      <p>In the event of "threats to the stability, security and integrity" of the internet in Russia, the authorities can establish centralised control by the state telecommunications watchdog.</p>
      <p>Internet providers have to take part in annual drills to test the technical devices needed for this.</p>
      <p>These devices have not yet been installed by internet providers, however, and are currently being tested, the RBK business daily reported.</p>
      <p>One of the law's authors, nationalist lawmaker Andrei Lugovoi, is a key suspect in the 2006 murder of Kremlin critic Alexander Litvinenko in Britain.</p>
