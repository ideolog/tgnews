      <p>Police are investigating threats against Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) staff.</p>
      <p>It followed the refusal of its incoming leader to agree a General Election pact with the Democratic Unionists.</p>
      <p>The DUP has also condemned the alleged intimidation.</p>
      <p>Deputy leader Nigel Dodds’ North Belfast seat is targeted by Sinn Fein, and the party wants to secure a deal which would see him run unopposed by a UUP candidate.</p>
      <p>A UUP statement said: “Our headquarters had received a number of calls of a threatening nature and we have alerted the Police Service of Northern Ireland to that fact.”</p>
      <p>Incoming UUP leader Steve Aiken has ruled out a pact with the DUP in a break with previous unionist practice designed to maximise the number of pro-union MPs returned.</p>
      <p>Mr Dodds said: “There have been some reports of intimidation and threats issued towards members and activists from the UUP.</p>
      <p>“Any such incidents are deplorable and must be totally condemned.</p>
      <p>“The only appropriate way to express your views and the most effective way to send a message in our society is through the ballot box.”</p>
