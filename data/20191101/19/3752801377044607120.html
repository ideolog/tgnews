      <h1>Muslim cemetery desecration case: Breakthrough imminent, says neighbourhood watch</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T19:42:00+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 19:42</time> by <a rel="author">Jenni Evans</a></address>
      <p>A breakthrough into who is behind the desecration of at least 80 graves at Mowbray Muslim cemetery in Cape Town is close at hand after a neighbourhood watch received a tip-off and recovered some items from the graveyard. </p>
      <p>"We received some information from someone who lives the mountain," said Cedric Thomas, the spokesperson for U-Watch neighbourhood watch.</p>
      <p>"We found a tombstone, we found pot plants, we found some of the railing that people put around the graves," Thomas told News24. </p>
      <p>He said they even found some of the special sheeting that the dead were swaddled in. </p>
      <p>The neighbourhood watch is still putting out feelers for more information about the incident. </p>
      <p>The discovery of the ripped out tombstones laid out in the shape of a cross and some shoved into open graves in the shape of triangles was made on Wednesday. </p>

      <p>Thomas said they were also trying to access CCTV footage to find out who was responsible. </p>
      <p>Earlier, Ganief Hendricks, the leader of the Al-Jamah-ah party, said if this was not a Halloween prank, it was the work of Satanists. </p>
      <p>"It is evil," added Hendricks.</p>
      <p>He also demanded to know why the State Security Agency was "so slack" as it had failed to detect the incident which would have required some planning, and a lot of effort. </p>
      <p>Hendricks said the cemetery's caretaker had retired three weeks ago.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, the Muslim Judicial Council's cemetery management committee head, Sheikh Riad Fataar, said families had to relive the trauma of burying loved ones as recently as a week ago.</p>
      <p>"Some are saying it's Satanism, some are saying it has to do with Halloween. I am sending an email this morning to the University of Cape Town's religion department to find out what these symbols mean.</p>
      <p>The police are investigating a case of malicious damage to property. </p>
