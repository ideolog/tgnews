        <b><a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/red-bull-racing">Red Bull</a> have made a good start to the US Grand Prix weekend as <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/max-verstappen">Max Verstappen</a> and <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/alexander-albon">Alex Albon</a> finished P1 and P3 respectively. Christian Horner is satisfied with the first session and is hopeful of being competitive later in the weekend.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Max Verstappen pipped <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/sebastian-vettel">Sebastian Vettel</a> to top the timesheets at the Circuit of the Americas in FP1 with Albon just behind having led a lot of the session. </p>
      <p>Several teams have emphasised the importance of getting in good laps during the practice sessions so they can get a good setup for qualifying and the race. The bend combinations and completely different sectors simply require that.</p>
      <p><i>"The circuit has dropped a bit,"</i> Christian Horner told the German branch of Motorsport.com.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“For example at the exit of the pit lane. However, that is the same for everyone. In any case, the first session started well here and it was really positive. "</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"We were very strong in Mexico and it would, of course, be great to have another strong weekend here in Austin."</i>
      </p>
      <p>Horner singled out Albon for some praise after his first-ever session at COTA, adding: <i>“It is impressive how quickly he became faster. He seems to be doing well on difficult circuits anyway. He is doing fine so far."</i></p>
