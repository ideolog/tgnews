      <h1>Alleged gunman behind Elsies River massacre claims he saw real shooters flee scene</h1>

      <p>One of the two suspects arrested for a massacre, which saw three children and a teenager being shot to death in a shack in Cape Town last month, insists he had been home when the shots rang out, claiming he had seen the actual shooters fleeing the scene.</p>
      <p>Rowan Stuurman, 31, in an affidavit read during his bail application, denied any involvement in the bloodbath behind Northmead Court in Clarke Estate on September 17.</p>
      <p>His co-accused, Peter Nokewes, did not apply for bail.</p>
      <p>According to Stuurman, he had been at home in Melton Way with friends and his brother at the time of the shooting.</p>
      <p>He claimed he and his friends had been sitting in his bedroom when the heard shots being fired at 23:05, adding he had run to a back window and saw two guys running.</p>
      <p>Not long after, he decided to put off the lights and get into bed. He was arrested more than an hour later.</p>
      <p>When the police arrived at his home, he explained he had an alibi, Stuurman said.</p>
      <p>The officer, who had come to arrest him, had relayed this to another policeman by phone, but he was nevertheless taken into custody and charged.</p>
      <p>One of the Stuurman's friends, Norman Adams, in an affidavit said he had been at the house where they had "smoked a pipe".</p>
      <p>But according to investigating officer Bradley Schuurman of the anti-gang unit, an eyewitness named Stuurman as one of the gunmen, insisting that "Snottas" - as he is known - had also fired at him as he ran from the scene in the direction of his home.</p>
      <p>According to the detective sergeant, the witness - who claims to be a reformed gangster - was watching from a window and saw Stuurman running away from the scene.</p>
      <p>"He said he shouted, 'Snottas, jou ma se p…s! Wat maak jy?' The suspect had turned around and fired one shot in his direction."</p>
      <p>The witness, 33, said he had known Stuurman for about 20 years as they had attended the same primary school. </p>
      <p>Gunmen had kicked open the door of the structure that night, where Bianca Alexander and Mandy Samuels lay in a makeshift bedroom with Samuels' daughter, Toslin, 10, between them.</p>
      <p>The shooters are said to have opened fire indiscriminately. Locals claimed to have heard about 50 shots. According to the police, ballistics showed evidence of 33 bullets being fired.</p>
      <p>Bianca's son, Adrian "AJ" Alexander, 12, was shot in the neck and Samuels' son, Malcolm "MJ" Samuels, 12, was shot in the face. The boys had fallen asleep on a couch opposite the doorway.</p>
      <p>Vineto "CJ" Africa, 19, was killed after he was shot in the face while lying on a bed in the same room as the boys. He is believed to have been the target of the shooting and was a member of the 12 Disciples gang.</p>
      <p>Toslin died instantly, while family members told News24 that the women had managed to escape when the shooters were forced to reload after running out of ammunition.</p>
      <p>Both women are currently in protective custody.</p>
      <p>Schuurman testified that Africa had been hiding out in the shack that night as he was wanted for a shooting in which a member of the 28s had been seriously wounded.</p>
      <p>The motive for the murders was believed to be retaliation, Schuurman told the court.</p>
      <p> The witness had previously been a member of the same gang that Africa belonged to.</p>
      <p>Stuurman and Nokewes are members of the Terribles, which is affiliated to the 28s.</p>
      <p>Both had gang tattoos on their bodies.</p>
      <p>The police were looking to force the witness into protective custody as he had received threats, had been assaulted and shot at, sustaining a flesh wound on his leg</p>
      <p>Stuurman has one prior conviction for drug possession for which he received a fine.</p>
      <p>Schuurman testified that the murders were a result of a turf battle between the warring gangs.</p>
      <p>"Three innocent children died because of a fight over territory," he said.</p>
      <p>The bail application continues on November 26.</p>
