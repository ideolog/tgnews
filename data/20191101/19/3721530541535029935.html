      <p>Five years after <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/overwatch/37910"><i>Overwatch</i></a> was announced at BlizzCon 2014, developer Blizzard Entertainment has introduced its next chapter, <i>Overwatch 2</i>.</p>
      <p><i>Overwatch</i> was released for PlayStation 4, Windows PC, and Xbox One on May 24, 2016. (A <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/9/4/20849154/overwatch-nintendo-switch-port-rumor-release-date">Nintendo Switch version was released last month</a>.) The team-based first-person shooter was multiplayer-only, with the world’s story told primarily outside the game. <i>Overwatch</i> 2 is expected to change that, pulling the universe’s story back into the game with a long-awaited story mode. A new hero, Sojourn, was revealed, too. <i>Overwatch’s</i> 31 heroes, plus more, will get all new looks.</p>
      <p>During its BlizzCon 2019 opening ceremony, Blizzard unveiled <i>Overwatch 2</i>, confirming information <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/10/27/20935019/overwatch-2-release-dates-leak-blizzcon-2019-new-mode-echo-debut-date-pc-ps4-xbox-one-switch">published by ESPN in October</a>. (<i>Overwatch</i> game director Jeff Kaplan introduced the game on stage, starting off with a goof on the recent leaks.) <i>Overwatch 2</i> is still a multiplayer experience, but players don’t only have to fight against each other. They’re working together in story-based missions, similar in design to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/4/2/17189214/overwatch-archives-retribution-uprising-event"><i>Overwatch’s</i> Archive event missions</a>. Heroes in these missions will operate on a leveling system to unlock “talents” and in-game items, all of which further iterate on <i>Overwatch</i>’s<i> </i>unique hero system.</p>
      <p>The <i>Overwatch</i> <i>2</i> cinematic begins with the reassembled crew dropping into Paris to fight a Null Sector invasion. Whoops, and now there’s a super giant omnic with a massive red laser beam. Mei’s injured in the fight — and Winston stays behind to hold the line, not before Genji, Reinhardt, Brigitte, Mercy, and Echo drop in. Notably, a few heroes clearly have new looks — and maybe new abilities, too. Genji’s sword looks a bit different, and Brigitte and Reinhardt are able to interlock shields.</p>
      <p>As they say, the cavalry’s here.</p>

      <p>Blizzard has typically told <i>Overwatch</i>’s story in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/11/4/13527484/overwatch-sombra-origin-story-video">animated videos</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/10/5/20899623/overwatch-book-scholastic-hero-of-numbani-may-2020">novels</a>, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/7/18/20698572/overwatch-comics-madefire-snapchat">comic books</a> — most of which has just documented the past. People invested in <i>Overwatch</i>’s lore have been begging Blizzard <a href="https://www.heroesneverdie.com/2018/10/16/17983960/overwatch-lore-hero-interactions">to move the dang story forward</a> already. The most exciting part of <i>Overwatch 2</i> is that it’ll finally happen.</p>
      <p>Despite introducing a story mode, Blizzard isn’t dropping the competitive multiplayer. A new competitive mode, Push, was also showcased at BlizzCon 2019. <i>Overwatch </i>players will play on all the same maps as <i>Overwatch 2</i> players, including the new maps. They’ll also get all the same heroes — “a shared multiplayer environment where no one gets left behind,” Kaplan said. Progress, too, will move forward into <i>Overwatch 2</i>.</p>
      <p>BlizzCon attendees can try out Push, Rio de Janeiro, and the new Toronto map during the event.</p>
