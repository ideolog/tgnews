      <p>With Orlando Pirates unbeaten in the Soweto derby for the past four years, Soccer Laduma takes a look at the 10 different goal-scorers in the most recent encounters.</p>
      <p>In 11 previous meetings across all competitions, Bucs have won five, drawn five and loss just once against Kaizer Chiefs, with Rulani Mokwena now tasked with keeping Pirates’ unbeaten record alive.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The Soweto derby is historically not a high scoring encounter, as seen with repetitive 0-0 and 1-1 draws in the past seasons, however, there has been some spectacular showdowns in the past years. </p>
      <p>While the likes of Tshegofatso Mabasa and Samir Nurkovic are expected to put up a show in front of goal this weekend, Soccer Laduma takes a look at 10 of the different and most recent goal-scorers in the encounter, who could look to once again step-up and set the scene alight:</p>
      <p>Daniel Cardoso – scored a penalty for Chiefs in a 1-1 draw in the Absa Premiership in February this year.</p>
      <p>Leonardo Castro – scored in Chiefs TKO semi-final loss in November 2018.</p>
      <p>Thembinkosi Lorch – scored in Pirates TKO semi-final win in November 2018.</p>
      <p>Justin Shonga - scored in Pirates TKO semi-final win in November 2018.</p>
      <p>Innocent Maela – scored in Pirates 2-1 Absa Premiership win in October 2018.</p>
      <p>Vincent Pule - scored in Pirates 2-1 Absa Premiership win in October 2018.</p>
      <p>Khama Billiat – scored in Chiefs’ 2-1 Absa Premiership loss in October 2018.</p>
      <p>Amigo Memela – scored twice in Pirates 3-1 Absa Premiership win in March 2018.</p>
      <p>Joseph Malongoane (unlikely to play this weekend) – scored in Chiefs 1-1 draw in March 2017.</p>
      <p>Tendai Ndoro (no longer at the club) – scored twice in Pirates 2-0 win over Chiefs in March 2016.</p>
      <p>With an obvious exclusion of Ndoro and Malongoane, who do you think will definitely get on the score-sheet this weekend? Let us know in the comments section below.</p>
