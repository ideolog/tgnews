      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a> have confirmed they have reached a settlement with former chief executive Keith Wyness.</p>
      <p>Wyness brought a claim against the club and former owner Dr Tony Xia, believing he was unfairly treated in the lead up to his departure.</p>
      <p>The former CEO was appointed by Xia in 2016 but was later suspended after falling out with the Chinese businessman.</p>
      <p>The suspension was handed to Wyness in 2018 and he later stepped down from his role promising legal action.</p>
      <p>Wyness brought a claim involving Villa, one that has now been settled out of court.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa</a> confirmed today that they have reached a settlement with the former Everton and Aberdeen executive.</p>
