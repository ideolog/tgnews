      <p>It's been several weeks since <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/08/09/google-pay-support-comes-to-21-more-us-banks-credit-unions-and-trusts/">we last checked in</a> to see the progress Google was making towards its apparent goal of signing every single financial institution in America up for Google Pay support. Unsurprisingly, Google's been very busy throughout this period, and today we're looking at all the new banks ready to work with the service.</p>
      <p>This update's a big one, since we've been cataloging all the new banks Google has brought on board since early August. Not all went live at the same time, but instead we've been seeing them arrive in fits and starts over the course of the past month-and-change. Here's what's new:</p>

          <p>If this were a newspaper, we'd be using "ink had yet to dry" idioms to describe just how quick Google's being with these recent Pay bank updates. In the not-quite-an-hour it's been since our last update, Google's added another ten financial institutions:</p>

            <p>After firing off a few back-to-back update rounds, it's now been a couple weeks since we last took a look at Google's latest efforts to recruit every bank in the nation under the banner of Google Pay support.
