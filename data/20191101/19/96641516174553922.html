      <p>Recently TikTok's popularity has exploded worldwide, and so has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/25/tiktok-censorship-china/">scrutiny over the app's parent company ByteDance</a> and its relationship to the Chinese government. Now <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/01/tiktok-bytedance-nut-pro-3-smartphone-smartisan/"><i>Reuters</i></a> reports that the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) has opened a national security review of the company, because it had not sought approval to make its $1 billion acquisition of Musical.ly in 2017.</p>
      <p>US lawmakers have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/10/24/tiktok-bytedance-national-security-senators-schumer-cotton/">expressed concern's over the app's ability to collect data</a>, while the company responded saying "<a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/TikTok/">TikTok </a>is committed to being a trusted and responsible corporate citizen in the US, which includes working with Congress and all relevant regulatory agencies." The report notes that Musical.ly founder and now-head-of-TikTok Alex Zhu recently began to report directly to ByteDance CEO Zhang Yiming, which could help separate it from the company's other holdings. Meanwhile, ByteDance <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/01/tiktok-bytedance-nut-pro-3-smartphone-smartisan/">just announced plans for its first smartphone</a>.</p>
