      <h1>Become a Front-End Master in 2020 With These 10 Project Ideas</h1>
      <p>Easily manage projects with <a href="https://synd.co/2JziuUL">monday.com</a></p>
      <p>This is a little updated cross-post from <a href="https://dev.to/chriscoyier/9-other-projects-you-can-do-to-become-a-front-end-master-in-2020-450l">a quickie article I wrote on DEV</a>. I'm publishing here 'cuz <a href="https://css-tricks.com/indieweb-and-webmentions/">I'm all IndieWeb</a> like that.</p>
      <p>I love <a href="https://dev.to/simonholdorf/9-projects-you-can-do-to-become-a-frontend-master-in-2020-n2h">this post by Simon Holdorf</a>. He's got some ideas for how to level up your skills as a front-end developer next year. Here they are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Build a movie search app using React</li>
        <li>Build a chat app with Vue</li>
        <li>Build a weather app with Angular</li>
        <li>Build a to-do app with Svelte</li>
      </ul>
      <p>... and 5 more like that.</p>
      <p>All good ideas. All <i>extremely</i> focused on JavaScript frameworks.<br/>I like thinking of being a front-end developer as being someone who is a browser person. You deal with <i>people</i> who use some kind of client to use the web on some kind of device. That's the job.</p>
      <p>I love JavaScript frameworks, but knowing them isn't what makes you a good front-end developer. <a href="https://css-tricks.com/front-end-developer-aware/">Being performance-focused and accessibility-focused, and thus user-focused</a> is what makes you a front-end master, beyond executing the skills required to get the website built.</p>
      <p>In that vein, here's some more ideas.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Go find <a href="https://dribbble.com/">a Dribbble shot</a> that appeals to you. Re-build it in HTML and CSS in the cleanest and most accessible way you can.</li>
        <li>Find a component you can abstract in your codebase, and abstract it so you can re-use it efficiently. Consider accessibility as you do it. Could you make it more accessible in a way that benefits the entire site? How about your SVG icon component — how's that looking these days?</li>
        <li>Try out <a href="https://serverless.css-tricks.com/services/ssgs">a static site generator</a> (perhaps one that isn't particularly JavaScript focused, just to experience it). What could the data source be? What could you make if you ran the build process on a timed schedule?</li>
        <li>Install the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/axe-devtools/">Axe accessibility plugin for DevTools</a> and run it on an important site you control. Make changes to improve the accessibility as it suggests.</li>
        <li>Spin up a copy of <a href="https://fractal.build/">Fractal</a>. Check out how it can help you think about building front-ends as components, even at the HTML and CSS level.</li>
        <li>Build a beautiful form in HTML/CSS that does something useful for you, like receive leads for freelance work. Learn <a href="https://css-tricks.com/form-validation-part-1-constraint-validation-html/">all about form validation</a> and see how much you can do in just HTML, then HTML <i>plus</i> some CSS, then with some vanilla JavaScript. Make the form work by using <a href="https://serverless.css-tricks.com/services/forms">a small dedicated service</a>.</li>
        <li><a href="https://serverless.css-tricks.com/about/">Read a bit about Serverless</a> and how it can extend your front-end developer skillset.</li>
        <li>Figure out how to implement an SVG icon system. So many sites these days need an icon set. <a href="https://css-tricks.com/pretty-good-svg-icon-system/">Inlining SVG</a> is a great simple solution, but how you can abstract that to easily implement it with your workflow? How can it work with the framework you use?</li>
        <li>Try to implement a <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/service-workers">service worker</a>. Read <a href="https://abookapart.com/products/going-offline">a book about them</a>. Do something <a href="https://simpleoffline.website/">very small</a>. Check out <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox">a framework</a> centered around them.</li>
        <li>Let's say you needed to put up a website where the entire thing was the name and address of the company, and a list of hours it is open. What's the absolute minimum amount of work and <a href="https://css-tricks.com/defining-and-dealing-with-technical-debt/">technical debt</a> you could incur to do it?</li>
      </ul>
