      <h1>PIC: Sinkhole closes road in Delmas, motorists urged to use alternative route</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T19:53:00+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 19:53</time> by <a rel="author">Ntwaagae Seleka</a></address>
      <p>A sinkhole on both sections of the R50 leading to Delmas, Pretoria has led to the road's closure, and motorists have been urged to find alternative routes. </p>
      <p>Gauteng Department of Roads and Transport spokesperson Melitah Madiba said the precautionary measure was due to the road surface continuing to deteriorate as a result of the sinkhole.</p>
      <p>"This after the department discovered the formation of a sinkhole depression on the R50/Delmas Road during routine maintenance. The steep gradient was temporarily filled for easy passage, with cracks being monitored and recorded daily. </p>
      <p>"The road is closed from an intersection at Elandsfontein Road as well as another intersection linking the R50 and R25. Access will be given to residents only," Madiba said.</p>

      <p>Motorists are being advised to make use of a detour, the D781, which is a gravel road linking the R50 to the R25.</p>
      <p>The closure is expected to be in effect for the foreseeable future as engineers and officials conduct studies to try and fix it.</p>
      <p>The department thanked motorists in advance for their understanding, saying their safety was a top priority.</p>
