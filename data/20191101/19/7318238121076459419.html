      <h1>Controversial new Russian internet law could increase censorship</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T19:59:39+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 19:59</time> by <a rel="author">Marika Dimitriadi </a></address>
      <p>A new Russian internet law came into effect on November 1 that lawmakers say is designed to protect the country's internet "Runet" in case of a cyber-attack or other external threat.</p>
      <p>The "sovereign internet" law would allow the country's telecommunications body Roskomnadzor to isolate the Runet from the global network in the event of an attack.</p>
      <p>The head of Roskomnadzor, Alexander Zharov, has said that they would only resort to blocking the internet or certain providers in an emergency.</p>
      <p>Critics say the law will allow the government to increase internet censorship.</p>
      <p>"Now the government can directly censor content or even turn Russia’s internet into a closed system without telling the public what they are doing or why," said Rachel Denber, deputy Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch, in a statement.</p>
      <p>"This jeopardizes the right of people in Russia to free speech and freedom of information online."</p>
      <h3>Special equipment</h3>
      <p>The law requires special equipment to be installed by internet providers which could filter and reroute traffic, and restrict access to illegal information.</p>
      <p>The law has entered into force, but the new equipment is not yet completed.</p>
      <p>The cost of implementing the law will amount to more than 30 billion rubles (€424 million), of which 20.8 billion rubles (€294 million) will be spent on purchasing equipment.</p>
      <p>Anton Fishman, a project director at cybersecurity firm Group-IB, said the law is justified.</p>
      <p>"Given the tense geopolitical situation and possible risks from other countries, this law is provided just for preliminary protection against possible risk," Fishman said.</p>
      <h3>'A new level' of censorship</h3>
      <p>But Christian Mihr, the executive director of Reporters Without Borders in Germany, said that it takes internet censorship to a new level.</p>
      <p>"It proves that the Russian leadership is ready to bring the entire network infrastructure under political control in order to cut off the digital information flow whenever needed," Mihr said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Russian digital rights NGO RosKomSvoboda that the law could increase internet blackouts. The group's lawyer, Sarkis Darbinyan said that although there is a growing cyber threat, the law will not make Russia's internet safer.</p>
      <p>Darbinyan also said that it did not guarantee freedom of information, freedom of expression or protection of privacy.</p>
      <p>The law does not specify which threats would bring the Runet under centralised control.</p>
