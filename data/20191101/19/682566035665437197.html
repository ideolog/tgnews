      <p>Cape Town - <b>Kaizer Chiefs</b> defender <b>Njabulo Blom</b> has paid tribute to his team-mates to guiding him through a high-pressure tie with <b>Mamelodi Sundowns</b> at Loftus Versfeld on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Despite only being 19-years-old, he played with a maturity beyond his years as he made two goal-saving interventions to help Chiefs to a crucial 2-0 victory and give them a major boost in the title race.</p>
      <p>The versatile defender now has another stern challenge with the upcoming Soweto derby on Saturday as Amakhosi take on Orlando Pirates.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Chiefs’ official website about that encounter, 'Stoppa' explained: "The game against Arrows was the most challenging for me because it was my first professional game.</p>
      <p>"I was nervous, but the other guys helped me out and got me to settle in well. It was the kind of game which could have made me or broke me.</p>
      <p>"Thanks to God my performance was good. We won and it has motivated me and helped me believe in my abilities."</p>
      <p>Saturday’s Soweto derby clash starts at 15:00.</p>
