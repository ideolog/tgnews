      <p>If you haven’t heard, because either you’ve been lost in the woods for weeks or you’ve been ignoring us, it’s almost time for <a href="https://www.vulturefestival.com/">Vulture Festival</a>. And while it’s still basically a poolside party with all your favorite celebrities, it is now, as of this moment, also <i>educational.</i> <i>New York </i>Magazine’s senior art critic Jerry Saltz is packing up his sunscreen and coming all the way out to Los Angeles to help you (yes, you!) learn to be an artist. Whether you’re an aspiring Rembrandt or a budding classroom doodler, he can help you become better, faster, stronger — um, creatively, of course. This talk, based on his extremely <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/11/jerry-saltz-how-to-be-an-artist.html">valuable article</a> that is soon to be a book, is for anyone who lays awake at night because of existential, anxiety-related reasons and not just noisy neighbors. Let Saltz take away your terror of doing and make you just start, by sharing his thinking on how to shut your demons right the hell up and get to work. Tickets just went on sale, so <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/vulture-festival-la-how-to-be-an-artist-with-jerry-saltz-tickets-79768079473">grab some while they last.</a></p>
