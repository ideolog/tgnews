      <h2>Remember when Westlife raised Plymouth up at Home Park in 2008?</h2>

      <p>Westlife are coming back to Plymouth - but who remembers when they played at Home Park in 2008?</p>
      <p>The exciting news was announced this morning that <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/whats-on/music-nightlife/pop-legends-westlife-coming-plymouth-3487879">Westlife will be performing at Plymouth's Home Park stadium on July 4 2020</a>.</p>
      <p>The band will also perform all of their greatest hits including Swear It Again, Flying Without Wings and You Raise Me Up.</p>
      <p>But who remembers their gig 11 years ago in Plymouth?</p>
      <p>Westlife performed at Home Park on Saturday, June 28 2008. It is estimated that over 18,000 fans went to watch them perform.</p>
      <p>At the time Westlife had already been going for 10 years and the one year break they were on caused their concerts to sell more tickets than ever.</p>
      <p>It wasn't just Westlife that performed - Simon Webbe, previously of Blue with backing singers and a band also took to the stage.</p>
      <p>And lifelong Westlife fan Paula Chapman was Flying Without Wings when she finally got to meet her musical heroes. Paula went to a meet and greet with the boy band at Home Park just before their long-awaited concert. She said the Irish lads were 'amazing' during the gig – and she said it was a 'dream come true' to meet them. She got to meet the lads thanks to help from The Herald and Plymouth Argyle.</p>

        <figcaption>Paula had been a follower of the chart-toppers for years, had seen them in concert eight times and even turned her flat's front window into a shrine to the Irish superstars. But when The Herald heard that she had never met the band it decided this had to change.</figcaption>

        <figcaption>The Westlife gig followed a Meat Loaf concert which was also held at Home Park – which took place the day before. Both gigs were billed under the Live and Kicking banner – and they were both part of Plymouth Summer Festival.<cite>(Image: Mike Pitch)</cite></figcaption>

        <figcaption>Paula Chapman said at the time: “Westlife were just amazing. The golden circle was full and there seemed to be lots of people in the stadium who were just enjoying Westlife's brilliant sound.<br/>“I think the best songs were Flying Without Wings and Hit Me With The Real Thing – but they were all amazing.<br/>“Thanks to The Herald and Argyle for making one of my dreams come true!”<cite>(Image: Mike Pitch)</cite></figcaption>

        <figcaption>Home Park Stadium was filled with girls, boys, mums, dads, grannies, grandads and couples, many with cowboy hats and bunny ears, and you couldn't help wonder how Westlife would manage to keep the attention of such a diverse age range.<cite>(Image: Mike Pitch)</cite></figcaption>

        <figcaption>After Simon Webb's support act, Westlife stormed the stage dressed in black leather, and it was soon clear that the white-suited barstool routine so long associated with the band was clearly a thing of the past.<br/>Pictured: Bethany Sargent, 12 Hannah Sargent, 14 and Paula Chapman who got to meet Westlife</figcaption>

        <figcaption>Reeling off numbers like 'Uptown Girl', 'Mandy', 'Queen of my Heart', 'If I let you go', and 'What makes a Man', you remembered just how many hits the boys have had – in fact they've notched up 14 number ones.<cite>(Image: Mike Pitch)</cite></figcaption>

        <figcaption>As fireworks flew off the stage and the stage lights flashed across the stadium, the fans danced on into the night, foot perfect with all their moves and word perfect with the lyrics... even the dutiful husbands couldn't help but get into the swing of it.<br/>Pictured: Elizabeth Wayman and Chris Wyatt</figcaption>

        <figcaption>When the band finally said their goodbyes and thanked the audience for such a great 10 years, they saved the best till last. A heartfelt rendition of 'Flying Without Wings' sent shivers down the spine and brought a tear to the eye of many adoring fans.<br/>Pictured: Hannah Sargent, 14 Paula Chapman, her sister Sara Hawkins and Bethany Sargent, 12 Paula Chapman: 07814 655900 rep: William</figcaption>

        <figcaption>After a stadium-wide singalong and more screams to get the band back on stage there just had to be an encore, and the boys didn't disappoint. 'When You're Looking Like That' soon had thousands of middle-aged women and teenage girls screaming, followed by the power ballad 'You Raise Me Up'. Well, if Home Park Stadium had a roof it would certainly have been raised.<cite>(Image: Mike Pitch)</cite></figcaption>
