      <p>REUTERS: Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has credited Anthony Martial with helping fellow forward Marcus Rashford to rediscover his goalscoring form and confidence in recent matches.</p>
      <p>Rashford, who turned 22 on Thursday, scored twice in United's League Cup victory win over Chelsea in midweek, including a stunning free-kick that took his tally to four goals in his past three starts for the club.</p>

      <p>His purple patch has coincided with the return of Anthony Martial, who shrugged off an eight-week injury layoff to dismantle the Norwich City defence in United's 3-1 Premier League victory at Carrow Road last weekend.</p>
      <p>"Since Anthony has come back, Marcus has flourished," Solskjaer told reporters ahead of United's league trip to Bournemouth on Saturday.</p>
      <p>"He's probably happier facing goal and being direct, driving at people, taking players on rather than being a target man with his back to goal. But he's only just turned 22 and he wants to master all the skills.</p>
      <p>"I'm sure we'll see more of him up front as a (number) nine, in a two with Anthony, in a three like he did at Norwich or out wide as he did at Chelsea."</p>
      <p>Academy graduate Scott McTominay has been equally influential in the midfield, having started all 10 of United's league games this season and cemented his first-team status under Solskjaer.</p>
      <p>"He's a leader, he's a Manchester United boy and you can tell he used to be a striker with the goal he scored against Norwich on the half-turn," Solskjaer said. "He's developing into a very good midfielder."</p>
      <p>Rashford, Harry Maguire and Victor Lindelof will face late fitness tests ahead of the visit to Bournemouth after picking up knocks against Chelsea.</p>
      <p>"It's still early. They had treatment yesterday. Today (they played in) a light session; hopefully they're ready," Solskjaer added.</p>
      <p>Paul Pogba, Luke Shaw, Nemanja Matic and Axel Tuanzebe are still on the sidelines and unlikely to be fit before the international break.</p>
