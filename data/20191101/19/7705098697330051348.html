      <h1>Avatar is Coming to Disney+ on Launch Day</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T19:17:01+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 19:17</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Abbate</a></address>
      <p>Disney+ launches in under two weeks, bringing several classic Disney films and TV shows plus a slew of original content. But now that the House of Mouse owns 20th Century Fox, we can expect to see some of that studio’s greatest hits there as well, including the second biggest film of all time. Disney+ has just confirmed that <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/avatar"><b>Avatar</b></a> will be available to stream when the platform goes live on November 12.</p>
      <p>The new streaming service made the announcement on <a href="https://twitter.com/disneyplus/status/1190313014236348417?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1190313014236348417&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcollider.com%2Favatar-disney-plus%2F">Twitter</a> with a new video featuring the film’s director, James Cameron. You can check out what he had to say below.</p>

      <p>Cameron is currently hard at work on four <b>Avatar</b> sequels that have been in production since 2017. Last year, he revealed that the main cast had completed performance capture work on the first two follow-ups. Right now, the next installments are scheduled to be released every other year between 2021 and 2027. However, it’s worth mentioning that <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/avatar-2"><b>Avatar 2</b></a> was originally supposed to come out in 2014. So it’s best to take these dates with a grain of salt until we finally see some footage.</p>
      <p>Disney’s newfound ownership of the <b>Avatar</b> franchise is obviously huge for the studio. After all, the sequels are all but guaranteed to be cash cows like the 2009 original. But even before the Fox acquisition was a done deal, Disney had a solid working relationship with Cameron. They opened <b>Pandora – The World of Avatar</b> at Walt Disney World’s Animal Kingdom in Florida back in 2017.</p>
