      <p>TANJUNG PIAI, Johor: A multi-cornered fight is expected at the Tanjung Piai parliamentary by-election, with another political party and a cabbies’ group expressing their intention to join the fray ahead of nomination day on Saturday (Nov 2).</p>
      <p>Prior to this, the ruling Pakatan Harapan (PH) coalition, Barisan Nasional (BN) and Parti Gerakan Rakyat Malaysia (Gerakan) announced their candidates for the by-election, the ninth since the general election (GE14) in May last year.</p>

      <p>On Friday, Barisan Jemaah Islamiah Se-Malaysia (Berjasa) told Malaysian media that it wanted to provide an "alternative choice" for Malay-Muslim voters.  </p>
      <p>The Malaysian Taxi Drivers Coalition, meanwhile, said Big Blue Taxi Services founder Shamsubahrin Ismail will stand as an independent candidate to "represent the lower income group".</p>
      <p>The by-election was called following the death of its PH member of parliament <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/malaysia-tanjung-piai-deputy-minister-farid-death-11929952">Dr Md Farid Md Rafik</a> on Sep 21 due to a heart attack.</p>

      <p>At GE14, Dr Md Farid from Prime Minister Dr Mahathir Mohamad’s Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia (PPBM) unseated BN incumbent Dr Wee Jeck Seng by a narrow margin of 524 votes.</p>
      <p>For this by-election, PH is fielding <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/tanjung-piai-by-election-candidates-ph-bn-12041350">Mr Karmaine Sardini</a>, the 66-year-old PPBM Tanjung Piai division chief, to defend the parliamentary seat.</p>
      <p>BN has decided that Dr Wee, from the Malaysian Chinese Association, would stand again to try and snatch the constituency back from PH.</p>
      <p>The 55-year-old is a two-term Tanjung Piai MP and a former deputy youth and sports minister.</p>

      <p>Gerakan, meanwhile, has named its deputy secretary-general Wendy Subramaniam as its candidate.</p>
      <p>The party hopes that its participation in the by-election would position it as the “third force” in the political arena.</p>
      <p>They will have two weeks to woo the 53,000 constituents – made up of 57 per cent Malay, 42 per cent Chinese, and 1 per cent Indians – before polling day on Nov 16.</p>

      <p>Several federal ministers have announced allocation for Tanjung Piai in recent weeks, drawing criticism of vote-buying.</p>
      <p>For instance, Youth and Sports Minister Syed Saddiq Syed Abdul Rahman pledged a RM4 million (US$960,000) allocation on Oct 19 to upgrade sports and recreational facilities in Tanjung Piai.</p>
      <p>A total of 264 street lamps would be installed in the constituency, while three jetties would be upgraded with an allocation of RM3 million.</p>
      <p>Johor Chief Minister Sahruddin Jamal denied on Friday that the government assistance were "goodies" ahead of the by-election, adding that it was the late Dr Md Farid who had applied for the allocation.</p>
      <p>According to Bernama, Dr Sahruddin said the infrastructure and education assistance, as well as fishermen welfare aid, had been planned much earlier when Dr Md Farid was still alive.</p>
      <p>“Md Farid had worked hard to ensure further development in the Tanjung Piai area,” he told reporters at the Kukup International Ferry Terminal.</p>
