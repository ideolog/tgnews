      <p>Sojourn has been a figure in the history of <i>Overwatch</i><i> </i>since the game’s launch. She originally showed up in the animated short <i>Recall </i>as one of the agents who received the message to re-join Overwatch. She later appeared in Ana’s Origins video as a member of Ana’s team, suggesting strong relationships with other heroes like Soldier: 76, McCree, and Reinhardt.</p>

      <p>She was most prominent in the <i>Overwatch</i> Archives event Storm Rising, where she took the role of Captain Sojourn. It seems like she may have moved into Ana Amari’s role after the latter was presumed to be dead.</p>
      <p>Sojourn’s addition to the roster comes in light of other big announcements, including PVE modes and new looks for the old heroes.</p>
