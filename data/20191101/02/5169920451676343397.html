      <p>Once again the familiar Fila foundation of red, white and navy is executed in a fresh way.</p>
      <p>World No.10 <b>Kiki Bertens</b> dazzled at the WTA Elite Trophy Zhuhai and the Shiseido WTA Finals Shenzhen in the V-neck <b><a href="https://www.tennis-warehouse.com/Fila_Womens_Fall_Heritage_Dress/descpageWAFILA-FWHDR.html?from=wta">Fall Heritage Dress</a> </b>featuring vintage-looking pinstripes — chevron above the waistline and vertical at the skirt.</p>
      <p>The contrast inset at the waist is coordinated with red accessories and a limited-edition colorway of the Axilus 2 Energized shoe.</p>

      <p>One more outfit from the classy Heritage collection is making our October fashion favorites -- <b>Karolina Pliskova</b>’s full pinstripe attire with its modern twist on the elegant simplicity of classic Fila.</p>
      <p>The Czech served style in the <a href="https://www.tennis-warehouse.com/Fila_Womens_Fall_Heritage_Stripe_Skirt/descpageWAFILA-FWHSTSK.html?from=wta"><b>Heritage Striped Skort</b></a> and matching navy <a href="https://www.tennis-warehouse.com/Fila_Womens_Fall_Heritage_Sleeveless_Polo/descpageWAFILA-FWHSP.html?from=wta"><b>Heritage Sleeveless Polo</b></a>, including a four snap button placket and a white ribbed collar that is coordinated with vertical white color-blocks on the sides.</p>

      <p>Bordeaux feels particularly suited for the fall/winter period and Nike’s top players, led by defending WTA Finals champion <b>Elina Svitolina</b>, brought this traditional color of the season to the tennis courts.</p>
      <p>To break down the dark red tone of the classic sporty <a href="https://www.tennis-warehouse.com/Nike_Womens_Winter_Elevated_Flouncy_Skirt/descpageWANIKE-NWEFSK.html?from=wta"><b>Winter Elevated Flouncy Skirt</b></a> and <b><a href="https://www.tennis-warehouse.com/Nike_Air_Zoom_Vapor_X_Red_Pink_Womens_Shoe/descpageWSNIKE-NWAZVRP.html?from=wta">Air Zoom Zero</a> </b>footwear, the Ukrainian opted for the white version of the <a href="https://www.tennis-warehouse.com/Nike_Womens_Winter_Court_Tank/descpageWANIKE-NWCTT.html?from=wta"><b>Winter Court Tank</b></a>, whose modified racerback hides traditional bra straps without sacrificing mobility.</p>

      <p>Nike’s new collection is not all about bordeaux -- there are also royal blue and baby pink tones, as we can see on the example of <b>Petra Kvitova</b>’s accessories and <b><a href="https://www.tennis-warehouse.com/Nike_Womens_Winter_Court_Dress/descpageWANIKE-NWWCTD.html?from=wta">Winter Court Dress</a></b>.</p>
      <p>The A-line silhouette is fitted through the bodice and flared at the waist for a simple look with timeless appeal.</p>
      <p>Stretchy knit fabric has a textured feel, a multidimensional feature that has been ever more popular in tennis fashion.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>This October, BGL BNP Paribas Luxembourg Open champion Jelena Ostapenko sported the grey version of <b><a href="https://www.tennis-warehouse.com/adidas_Womens_New_York_Dress/descpageWAADIDAS-AWFNYD.html?from=wta">adidas’ 3-in-1 dress</a></b> with contrasting orange bra and shorts meant to grab attention as armholes and rounded side vents at the skirt are quite large.</p>
      <p>This style was originally created for the US Open, so the stretchy dress has an eye-catching NYC-inspired pattern integrated into the fabric.</p>
      <p>
