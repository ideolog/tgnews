      <p>Good Smile Company’s Nendoroid line of action figures is known for huge heads on tiny bodies and incredible cuteness. Or at least it was.<i> It</i> has changed all that. Nendoroid Pennywise is not an adorable scamp at all.</p>
      <p>The rictus grin, the cracked forehead, both somehow even bigger than the one actor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Skarsg%C3%A5rd">Bill Skarsgård</a> sports in his portrayal, are the stuff of nightmares, not tiny desktop companions. I’m sure many fans of the new movies will disagree with me, but no.</p>

      <p>God no.</p>
      <p>I am all for <i>It</i> figures. Pennywise in any form is a horror icon. But he’s scary enough when portrayed realistically. Contorted into Good Smile Company’s big-headed anime style, he is simply hideous. I keep having to tab over to the company’s newly-announced Spider-Gwen figure to keep from getting too skeeved out.</p>
      <p>For those interested in the figure, <a href="https://goodsmileshop.com/en/CATEGORY-ROOT/Nendoroid/Nendoroid-Pennywise/p/GSC_WD_00087">now up for preorder with a June 2020 release date</a>, know that it comes with some nifty accessories. He’s got a balloon, of course, but also a tiny origami boat and a sewer hideout, to recreate the iconic scene from the film.</p>

      <p>He also comes with a second face. It is not good.</p>

      <p>Going to go huddle in the corner and cry now.</p>
