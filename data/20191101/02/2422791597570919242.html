      <h1>Post-presidency, Trump says he's living in Palm Beach, not New York</h1>

      <p>WASHINGTON -- U.S. President Donald Trump says he will be making Palm Beach, Florida, his permanent residence after he leaves the White House, rather than returning to Trump Tower in New York.</p>
      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1190079191355670529">Trump tweeted</a> late Thursday that he cherished New York. But he added that "despite the fact that I pay millions of dollars in city, state and local taxes each year, I have been treated very badly by the political leaders of both the city and state."</p>
      <p>The New York Times reported earlier Thursday that Trump had filed "declaration of domicile" paperwork changing his "predominant and principal home" to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.</p>
      <p>Trump, who was born in New York, says "it will always have a special place in my heart!"</p>
