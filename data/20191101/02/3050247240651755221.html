      <h1>SBI’s Crypto-Focused Venture Capital Arm Sees Major Turnaround On Year</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T02:05:00+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 02:05</time> by <a rel="author">Helen Partz</a></address>
      <p>SBI Securities’ trading revenue surged 19.2% in 2019, largely due to the inclusion of the company’s crypto investment wing, which turned a $7.1 million loss into a $30 million profit over the year.</p>
      <p>Japanese financial services giant SBI Holdings released its new financial <a href="https://www.sbigroup.co.jp/english/investors/disclosure/presentation/pdf/191030presentations.pdf">report</a> on Oct. 30. The report analyzed results for the six-month period ended Sept. 30, 2019 and witnessed major growth of SBI’s crypto-heavy venture capital arm in 2019 amid a general decline in SBI’s revenue.</p>
      <h3>SBI VC Trade profits grow over $30 million over a year</h3>
      <p>According to the report, SBI VC Trade’s profit before income tax expense has seen a considerable increase in the first half of the fiscal year (FY) 2019. The number has surged from 765 million Japanese yen ($7.1 million) in losses in H1 FY2018 to as high as 3.2 billion yen ($30 million) in profits in H1 FY2019, the firm said.</p>
      <p>SBI Holdings noted that SBI VC Trade, an SBI affiliate that operates a crypto asset exchange, became a subsidiary of SBI Securities in July 2019. </p>
      <h3>SBI’s crypto mining business SBI Crypto surges $10 million</h3>
      <p>Alongside notable growth of crypto exchange-driven profits, SBI has also recorded a significant increase in profits from its cryptocurrency mining business SBI Crypto, according to the report. As such, the business’ profit before income tax expense added almost $10 million from 783 million yen ($7.2 million) in losses in H1 FY2018 to 293 million yen ($2.7 million) in H1 FY2019.</p>
      <p>SBI added that it also expects a further increase in the scale of crypto asset mining due to new miner operations within the year as well as in-house miner operations in 2020.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, SBI <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/japan-sbi-group-sets-up-spin-off-to-manufacture-crypto-mining-chips">established</a> a dedicated division for manufacturing crypto mining chips.</p>
      <h3>Further advances with Ripple</h3>
      <p>Similarly to previous financial <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/sbi-reports-financial-results-recognizes-ripple-for-cross-border-payments">reports</a>, SBI has again outlined the growing importance of Ripple’s technology in its remittance division, SBI Remit as well as the development of Ripple’s xCurrent-based remittances. SBI noted that its Ripple-connected subsidiary <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/sbi-ripple-asia-to-trial-store-settlement-service-for-xrp-powered-payments-app-moneytap?utm_source=Telegram&amp;utm_medium=social">SBI Ripple Asia</a> is expected to cover nearly 50% of the overall Ripple network once the connection is activated.</p>
      <p>On Oct. 1, Cointelegraph <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/rakuten-sbi-monex-launch-japan-sto-association-official">reported</a> on SBI Securities and five other Japanese brokerage firms including Rakuten Securities setting up Japan <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-an-sto-explained">Security Token Offering</a> Association.</p>
