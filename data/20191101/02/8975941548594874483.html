      <p>President Donald Trump’s permanent address is no longer New York City.</p>
      <p>In a series of tweets Thursday night, the president said he has moved his permanent residence to Palm Beach, Fla., and said he had been “treated very badly by the political leaders of both the city and state” of New York. “Few have been treated worse,” he said, through he added New York “will always have a special place in my heart!”</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/31/us/politics/trump-new-york-florida-primary-residence.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage">The New York Times first reported </a>the move, citing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/10/31/us/trump-residence-documents.html">documents filed in Florida </a>by Trump and his wife, Melania, that said their primary residence was now Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort.</p>
      <p>The Times reported the move was primarily for tax purposes. Florida does not have a state income tax or inheritance tax.</p>
      <p>The Times also said the move will not affect the effort by New York’s attorney general to try to obtain Trump’s federal tax records.</p>
      <p>Trump has been a lifetime New Yorker, and his triplex in Manhattan’s Trump Tower has been his primary residence since 1983, but since becoming president he’s spent far more time at Mar-a-Lago than Manhattan.</p>
      <p>“Good riddance. It’s not like @realDonaldTrump paid taxes here anyway... He’s all yours, Florida,” <a href="https://twitter.com/NYGovCuomo/status/1190059166129426432">New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo tweeted </a>after the report.</p>
