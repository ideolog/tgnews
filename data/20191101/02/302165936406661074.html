      <p>NEW YORK, Nov 1 — After Japan’s historic Unesco-listed Shuri castle was devastated by fire yesterday, here are other cases of major heritage sites that have gone up in the flames in recent years.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Notre-Dame</b>
      </p>
      <p>On the evening of April 15, 2019, smoke and then flames were spotted billowing from Paris’ 850-year-old cathedral, the most visited historic monument in Europe.</p>
      <p>Spreading from the attic, the fire devoured the roof’s wooden frame and the spire crashed down in flames.</p>
      <p>The cause of the blaze is not known, with an electrical fault or a cigarette among the theories.</p>
      <p>It took 400 firefighters several hours to control the blaze; stained glass windows, towers, bells and most artworks and relics survived.</p>
      <p>With clean-up and reinforcement work under way, reconstruction is not expected to start before 2021.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Brazil’s National Museum</b>
      </p>
      <p>Late on September 2, 2018, a faulty air conditioning system sparked a fire that tore through Brazil’s National Museum, destroying most of its prized collection.</p>
      <p>Latin America’s largest natural history, the gutted building had held more than 20 million artefacts, including 26,000 fossils.</p>
      <p>Entire collections were lost, including one that catalogued five million insects.</p>
      <p>Among the recovered items are fragments of the 12,000-year-old remains of a human being, and others of a dinosaur.</p>
      <p>The museum is seeking funds for restoration.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Shroud of Turin spared</b>
      </p>
      <p>In April 1997 a fire swept through the cathedral in northern Italy that contains the famous Shroud of Turin — believed by some Christians to be the burial cloth of Jesus.</p>
      <p>The relic escaped because it has been moved during restoration work.</p>
      <p>The blaze, which may have been caused by a short circuit, rapidly engulfed the wooden dome of the 17th-century chapel in the city of Turin, and spread to the adjacent palace, destroying many art works.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Venice opera house</b>
      </p>
      <p>In January 1996 fire engulfed Venice’s 18th-century Teatro La Fenice (The Phoenix), one of the world’s most beautiful opera houses.</p>
      <p>The flames, fanned by a breeze from the lagoon, spread quickly through the largely wooden interior, with the floors and then roof collapsing.</p>
      <p>The elegant building, which had already suffered major fires, had been closed for restoration. Two electricians were jailed for negligence.</p>
      <p>After major reconstruction works, La Fenice was fully reopened in 2004.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Barcelona opera house</b>
      </p>
      <p>One of Spain’s cultural jewels, Barcelona’s 150-year-old Gran Teatre del Liceu was destroyed by fire in January 1994.</p>
      <p>Only the foyer and the horseshoe arch over the auditorium were left standing.</p>
      <p>On the famous La Rambla avenue, the opera house was rebuilt and enlarged, reopening in 1999.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Windsor Castle</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 11-century castle west of London, Queen Elizabeth’s favourite residence, suffered extensive damage in 1992 in a fire that started when a lighting projector set too close to a curtain caused a blaze in a chapel.</p>
      <p>Around one-fifth of the castle was destroyed, including more than 100 of its 1,000 rooms. After major work, it reopened to the public in 1997.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Bosnia’s National Library</b>
      </p>
      <p>In August 1992 Serb forces besieging Sarajevo during the war fired incendiary shells into Bosnia’s 19th century National Library, almost burning it to the ground.</p>
      <p>Only about 10 per cent of the two million books, photographs and other documents it contained survived.</p>
      <p>Reconstructed in keeping with its pseudo-Moorish style, the new library was inaugurated in 2014.</p>
      <p>
        <b>York Minster</b>
      </p>
      <p>In July 1984 a fire believed to have been sparked by a lightning strike almost destroyed the 15th-century York Minster cathedral, one of Britain’s most famous churches.</p>
      <p>The heat cracked its 16th century stained glass Rose Window but it was repaired in restoration work completed in 1988. — AFP</p>
