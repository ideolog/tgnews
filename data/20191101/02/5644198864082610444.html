      <p>Past winners will look to build on their dynasties at the New York City Marathon on Sunday, with returning champion Mary Keitany poised to reclaim her crown and a trio of veterans favored in the men's division.</p>
      <p>NEW YORK: Past winners will look to build on their dynasties at the New York City Marathon on Sunday, with returning champion Mary Keitany poised to reclaim her crown and a trio of veterans favored in the men's division.</p>
      <p>Defending men's champion Lelisa Desisa, who claimed victory in the World Athletics Championship marathon in sweltering Doha earlier in October, said he had focused on recuperating in between races.</p>

      <p>"Doha is very hot, it is very difficult to run," said the Ethiopian, who hopes to compete in next year's Tokyo Olympics. "After Doha I tried to take recovery and I did recovery training. Marathon is not easy, my friend."</p>
      <p>A month-and-a-half after setting a world record in the half marathon, Geoffrey Kamworor was not fazed by New York City's varied terrain, where he claimed his maiden World Marathon Major title in 2017.</p>
      <p>"I did what I normally do to run a marathon. I think I'm ready, I don't have any pressure," said Kamworor, who has run the race four times and finished third last year.</p>
      <p>"To me, I have familiarized myself with the course and I don't have any challenges."</p>
      <p>Shura Kitata, who lost to Desisa by two seconds a year ago and came in fourth in London earlier this year, is out for revenge, saying on Twitter that he had failed to fuel properly for the race.</p>
      <p>The women's field appears more lopsided, with returning champion Keitany the favorite after reigning Boston Marathon champion Worknesh Degefa dropped out earlier this month, citing a foot injury that caused her to lose too much training time.</p>
      <p>"My training has been going well. I think I didn't change too much and I trained well. No problem," said Keitany. "I'm ready to tackle my race."</p>
      <p>Asked whether she was aiming for a course record, one of a rare few accolades she has not yet claimed in New York, Keitany deflected the inquiry.</p>
      <p>"There are other athletes and I respect them," the 37-year-old Kenyan told reporters. "For now I'm not talking about any course record."</p>
      <p>The four-time New York City Marathon winner is still far from Grete Waitz's nine-time winning record, but said a fifth victory would still be sweet, since it would help "catch up."</p>
