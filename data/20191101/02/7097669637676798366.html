      <h1>Stray bullet in Chicago wounds 7-year-old girl who was trick or treating</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T02:33:56+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 02:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.reuters.com/" target="_blank">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>(Reuters) - A 7-year-old girl who was trick or treating in Chicago on Thursday for Halloween was critically wounded when she was struck by a stray bullet, police said.</p>
      <p>The girl was in a costume and out with her family in the Little Village neighborhood when at least one person in a group fired shots, Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said by phone.</p>
      <p>The group of young men were chasing another man along the street, police said.</p>
      <p>The girl was not targeted on purpose, Guglielmi said, and a 31-year-old man who was shot in the hand may have been the intended victim.</p>
      <p>No one was immediately arrested in connection with the shooting, but a manhunt was under way.</p>
      <p>"This is unacceptable," Sgt. Rocco Alioto told ABC News. "A 7-year-old girl that was trick-or-treating with her family had to get shot because a group of guys want to shoot at another male."</p>
      <p>Police have received leads on a vehicle the group of suspects may have used and tactical teams were looking for it, Guglielmi said. Police also were reviewing footage from surveillance cameras along the street.</p>
      <p>"Helpful community info is already coming in but we need more," Guglielmi said on Twitter.</p>
      <p>Chicago, the nation's third-largest city, has grappled with a high homicide rate over the last few years, which President Donald Trump has cited as troublesome.</p>
      <p>Chicago's Democratic leaders have accused the Republican president of using the city's crime rate to malign it.</p>
      <p>Chicago had 561 homicides in 2018 and the Chicago Tribune has reported that, through Oct. 26, it had 436 homicides this year.</p>
