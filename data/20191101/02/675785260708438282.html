      <h1>Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain makes admission over substitute role at Liverpool</h1>
      <h2>The Reds' midfielder scored a stunning goal during the Carabao Cup win over Arsenal on Wednesday</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T02:56:07+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 02:56</time> by <a rel="author">Hassan Rashed</a></address>
      <p>Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain says he must improve to secure a regular starting spot in Liverpool's midfield after he admitted he was not happy with his performance in the Carabao Cup win over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> .</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old made his sixth start of the season for the Reds during the 5-5 draw at Anfield, which Jurgen Klopp's youthful side went on to win on penalties.</p>
      <p>Oxlade-Chamberlain, who missed most of last season with a serious knee injury, found the net with a stunning long-range effort to help <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> book a quarter-final meeting with Aston Villa.</p>
      <p>It was the midfielder's third goal in two games, adding to a brace against Genk the previous week, but he accepts he was far from his best against his former club.</p>

      <p>"Quality-wise, I am not too happy with my performance to be honest," said Oxlade-Chamberlain.</p>
      <p>"I wasn't great on the ball and not near my own personal level of where I want to be. I put in a good shift and run a lot.</p>
      <p>"I watch the boys of a weekend and I know what it is about here. You have got to be at a really high physical level to go and put in a performance like that.</p>
      <p>"Fab (Fabinho) did really well at the weekend so I need to keep pushing myself and maybe I will get a chance."</p>

      <p>Oxlade-Chamberlain's strike against Unai Emery's side was his eighth goal in 55 matches for Liverpool and was the latest in a number of stunning efforts he has produced since making the switch from North London in 2017.</p>
      <p>It followed another outstanding finish with the outside of his right foot in the 4-1 Champions League win in Belgium, and the England international admitted that the quality of his latest goal made it hard to contain his emotions.</p>
      <p>"At the minute they are not tap-ins, let's put it that way," he added.</p>
      <p>"It was a pretty good goal so it was really hard to keep the celebrations in but that is always something that I knew I would do against my former club.</p>

      <p>"I always want to show a lot of respect for Arsenal and what they did for me and the times I had there.</p>
      <p>"I didn't want to celebrate but it was a tough one to hold in. I wanted to take my shirt off and go mad.</p>
      <p>"I have been given license to shoot from outside the box and the last few games I've managed to do that. Hopefully it continues."</p>
