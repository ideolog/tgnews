      <h1>Aceh religious official who helped draft laws on adultery flogged for having an affair</h1>

      <p>An Indonesian man working for an organisation which helped draft strict religious laws ordering adulterers to be flogged was himself publically whipped Thursday after he was caught having an affair with a married woman.</p>
      <p>Flogging is a common punishment for a range of offences in the deeply conservative Aceh region on Sumatra island, including adultery, drinking alcohol, and having gay or pre-marital sex.</p>
      <p>Aceh is the only region in the world’s biggest Muslim-majority nation that imposes Islamic law, part of a 2005 autonomy deal with the central government that ended a decades-long separatist insurgency.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, a masked religious officer rained down 28 lashes on the back of Aceh Ulema Council (MPU) member Mukhlis after he was caught canoodling with a married woman last month.</p>
      <p>Mukhlis grimaced and flinched during the punishment in the provincial capital Banda Aceh, before his married companion was flogged with a rattan cane some 23 times.</p>
      <p>The organisation that Mukhlis works for advised the local government and legislature on drafting and implementing Aceh’s religious law, including public flogging.</p>
      <p>It was not immediately clear what he did for the agency.</p>
      <p>The council made headlines this summer when it hit out at plans to form a national women’s football league because Aceh did not have a special stadium where only women players, match officials and spectators would be present.</p>
      <p>In June, it issued a fatwa, or religious edict, <a href="https://coconuts.co/jakarta/news/aceh-ulema-council-wants-to-see-fatwa-against-pubg-adopted-into-law-with-caning-as-possible-punishment/">against online game PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds (PUBG)</a>, saying it insulted Islam and made addicted players violent.</p>
      <p>Flogging a council member underlined the commitment to enforcing Islamic law, said Aceh Besar deputy regent Husaini Wahab.</p>
      <p>“No matter who you are… if you violate (Islamic) law you will be whipped,” he told reporters after the punishment.</p>
      <p>Mukhlis would likely be sacked under his employer’s moral code, Wahab added.</p>
      <p>Also Thursday, a female university student was flogged a dozen times after she was caught spending the night in a boarding house with a man, who escaped punishment because he was underage.</p>
      <p>Dozens of onlookers watched the floggings, with some recording them on their mobile phones.</p>
      <p>“I was just curious to see how it was carried out,” said spectator Robbi.</p>
      <p>In July, three people were flogged 100 times each for having premarital sex, while last year two men caught having sex with underaged girls were also whipped 100 times.</p>
      <p>Rights groups have slammed public caning as a cruel and inhuman punishment, and Indonesia’s President Joko Widodo has called for it to end.</p>
      <p>But the practice has wide support among Aceh’s mostly Muslim population.</p>
