      <p><b>Porsche</b> has confirmed a manual version of the latest<b> 911</b> will be <b>offered in Australia from next year</b>, but the company hasn't confirmed whether it will be offered on the base Carrera.</p>
      <p>As before, the manual offered in non-GT <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/porsche/911/">911 models</a> will be a seven-speeder. Porsche says the 100km/h sprint takes <b>around four seconds</b>, and the manual is about 10kg lighter than the dual-clutch PDK automatic.</p>
      <p>Although it locked in a 2020 launch for the three-pedal 911, <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/porsche/">Porsche Australia</a> says it has "nothing to confirm at this stage" about which models will get the option.</p>
      <p>In the USA, Porsche will only offer the option on the more expensive, more powerful 911 Carrera S and 4S.</p>

      <p>The 'stick shift' is a no-cost option in America, and comes with the Sport Chrono pack and its active engine mounts, auto rev-matching, and a wheel-mounted drive mode switch as standard.</p>
      <p>Were Porsche to follow in its footsteps locally, the cheapest manual 911 would start at <b>$264,400 before on-road costs </b>â€“ $34,900 more expensive than the entry-level 911 Carrera.</p>
      <p>It would also raise the price of entry to three-pedal 911 ownership by$43,900 over the now-superseded 991.2 model.</p>
