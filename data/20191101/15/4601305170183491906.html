      <h1>Massive spike in young people registering to vote in the UK</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T15:51:43+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 15:51</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://boingboing.net/author/cory_doctorow_1" target="_blank">Cory Doctorow</a></address>
      <p>The announcement of a UK General Election on Dec 12 -- the third in less than five years! -- was attended by predictable rises in the numbers of people registering to vote, but as <a href="https://www.gov.uk/performance/register-to-vote/registrations-by-age-group">official statistics show</a>, the end of October saw a <i>massive</i> spike in voter registration among under 45s, led by under-25s and 25-34 year olds.</p>
      <p>It's a <a href="https://boingboing.net/2019/10/31/how-the-british-left-should-se.html">commonplace that Labour can't possibly win this election</a>, but that's what they said <a href="https://boingboing.net/2017/07/08/unelectablity-reconsidered.html">in 2017</a>, and that election was a bloodbath for the Tories and saw Labour come within a hairsbreadth of forming the government, despite <a href="https://boingboing.net/2018/09/27/tory-1st-battalion.html">dirty tricks</a>, <a href="https://boingboing.net/2018/10/10/nowhere-to-hide.html">panicmongering</a>, and a <a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2019/10/labour-party-antisemitism-claims-jeremy-corbyn">smear campaign</a> that was backed by the Labour establishment itself.</p>
      <p>The reality is that Labour is the only party with policies that are <a href="https://boingboing.net/2017/09/29/leviathan-from-the-depths.html">supported by the vast majority of Britons</a>, and while <a href="https://boingboing.net/2018/01/30/staunch-septuagenarians.html">that support comes from all demographics</a>, Labour's embrace of the <a href="https://www.labourgnd.uk/">Green New Deal</a> makes it the only party on the British political stage that is aligned with the largest mass movement in recent memory, Climate Extinction, which skews younger.</p>
      <p>All election polling is primarily a guessing game about <i>who just won't bother to vote</i>, and models assume very low turnout among young voters. The massive influx of young voters means that the election is truly anyone's to win.</p>
