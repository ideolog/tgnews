      <p>WASHINGTON, Nov 1 — US President Donald Trump’s administration will look very closely at the planned merger between Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot owner PSA, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said today.</p>
      <p>The deal, announced yesterday, would create the world’s fourth-largest automaker.</p>
      <p>“We will obviously look at it very, very carefully,” Kudlow said on Bloomberg. “The president has not commented on the deal. ... We’re not afraid of doing business with international companies, Lord knows.”</p>
      <p>When asked about the 12.2 per cent equity stake and 19.5 per cent voting stake China’s Dongfeng Motors holds in PSA, Kudlow said: “With respect to the Chinese story, we obviously are alert and on guard.”</p>
      <p>There has been speculation Dongfeng might sell its holdings, which could help ease the deal’s passage through US regulators, given US-Chinese trade tensions.</p>
      <p>“We will welcome a good deal. We hope it will get more production in the United States, more factories and workers and employment in the US And with respect to the Chinese angle, we will take a careful look at it,” Kudlow said. — Reuters</p>
