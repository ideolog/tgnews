      <p>NEW DELHI, Nov 1 — Indian police rescued a baby as its family was about to bury it alive, officials said today.</p>
      <p>Officers confronted the infant’s grandfather as he held the child in a blanket, while another man dug a hole with his hands on wasteland in a suburb of the southern city of Hyderabad.</p>
      <p>The case was made public two weeks after a newborn girl was found in a clay pot at a northern Indian crematorium — later making headlines for her “miracle” survival.</p>
      <p>In the latest incident, the two men said the infant had died in hospital. But police, tipped off by a taxi driver made suspicious by the events, said they saw the baby move under the blanket.</p>
      <p>Both men were detained and later released, with the infant undergoing treatment in hospital while an investigation is carried out.</p>
      <p>“They thought the baby had died and were told by other family members not to bring the body home,” police officer A. Srinivasulu told AFP.</p>
      <p>“We are just happy that the baby was rescued,” the officer said.</p>
      <p>In the other case of the newborn found in a clay pot, the baby was believed to have been left for more than two days before she was found by a man digging a grave for his own newborn daughter.</p>
      <p>India is notorious for the gender killing of baby girls, seen as a financial burden because of the dowry to be paid when they are married.</p>
      <p>Such discrimination is blamed for India’s skewed sex ratio that stood at 940 females for every 1,000 males, according to a 2011 census. — AFP</p>
