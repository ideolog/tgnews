      <p>Councillor Ian Dickson said: “This year’s events will have an exceptional mix of talented authors and inspirational speakers including the acclaimed journalist, David Pratt who will have a very interesting story to tell through his travels .</p>
      <p>“Crime fiction is very popular and I’m sure Karen Campbell’s event on crime fiction will entertain.</p>
      <p>“We are absolutely delighted to welcome local author, Paul Murdoch to this year’s line up whose talk promises to be a big hit with the audience.</p>
      <p>“It is great that we have attracted such a wealth of talent to share their stories with us during this year’s Book Week Scotland events.”</p>
      <p>Councillor Iain McLaren added: “We have a great range of talent lined up for this year's Book Week Scotland with a range of events at libraries across West Dunbartonshire.</p>
      <p>“Our staff have done a great job by securing high profile speakers  which will make our programme increasingly popular with our residents. I would encourage residents to book early to avoid disappointment.”</p>

      <p>Paul Murdoch’s new book, Old Bloke Goes Running, tells the tale of a guy in his fifties who got fit, which he hopes will encourage others to realise that it’s never too late to get healthy.</p>
