      <h2>Here's Tech Advisor's guide to the biggest and best games coming out this year and beyond for PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. These are our most anticipated upcoming game releases.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T15:01:00+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 15:01</time> by <a rel="author">Hannah Cowton</a></address>
      <p>Though we're now in the last quarter of 2019, there's still a lot to look forward to on the horizon. The likes of Metro Exodus and Devil May Cry 5 have blown us away over the last few months, and we've still got titles such as Pokémon Sword And Shield and Cyberpunk 2077 to come - just to name a few. </p>
      <p>It's exhausting trying to keep up with all the new releases on the way, so we've decided to do the hard work for you and round up all of the biggest and best games on the way this year, next year, and even a few that might be further off than that. We've done our best to include games from across all the main consoles and PC, listed in release date order.</p>
      <p>If you'd rather find out about great games that are already actually out, your best bet is to check out our individual guides to the best games on the <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/buying-advice/game/best-ps4-games-2018-3645201/">PS4</a>, <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/buying-advice/game/best-xbox-one-games-2018-3632623/">Xbox One</a>, <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/buying-advice/game/best-pc-games-2018-3623563/">PC</a>, and <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/buying-advice/game/best-nintendo-switch-games-2018-3652895/">Switch</a>.</p>

We do know that it'll include a host of celebrities including voice acting from Mads Mikkelsen, Norman Redus and Guillermo Del Toro, and that it'll be unlike any game we've ever played.</p>

The current starters confirmed are Scorbunny, Sobble and Grookey (Fire, Water and Grass types respectively).

      <p>World Championship Racing 8 is now coming to the Nintendo Switch. The game had a huge overhaul when it came to the career mode. Alongside the usual racing, you'll be in charge of the schedule and activity management between rallies, research and development to improve the car, recruitment and management of your staff. Dynamic weather has also been added to the game, which will make an impact on both the visuals and gameplay. </p>
      <h3>Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</h3>

      <p>It's about time we finally got a single-player, story-focused Star Wars game. This title follows Padawan Cal Kestis, one of the last surviving Jedi post Revenge of the Sith. Cal is on the run from an elite inquisitor - the Second Sister - from the Galactic Empire after using the force to save a friend and a droid witnessed his powers. Along the way Cal will visit some iconic Star Wars locations, including the Wookie planet, Kashyyyk (though no word yet on if we'll get some fun cameos, but we're keeping our lightsabers crossed). </p>

      <p>Shenmue III is a very unique case in the video game world. The first two games were released by Sega in 1999 and 2001 respectively. They gained a cult fanbase over time, but the third title got locked in the development stage for a long time. Finally, after launching a crowdfunding campaign, Shenmue III is finally on its way. This combat game follows Ryo Hazuki, who has travelled to China in search of his father's killer, Lan Di.</p>

      <p><b>Platforms:</b> PS VR<br/><b>Release date:</b> 28 February 2020<br/><b>Pre-order:</b> <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Marvels-Iron-Man-VR-PS4/dp/B07YSYRMTJ?ascsubtag=06-3681334-11-0000000">Amazon UK</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Marvels-Iron-Man-VR-PlayStation-4/dp/B07YXQJ1S5/?ascsubtag=06-3681334-11-0000000">Amazon US</a></p>
      <p>We've all looked at Tony Stark and thought, 'Man, I wish I had one of those Iron Man suits for myself'. Well, now you can. Iron Man VR is coming to PS VR,  in which you play the billionaire superhero who is facing off against a ghost of his past. You'll be able to use the repulsor jets to shoot and control the flight movement for the suit, and as you progress through the game you'll be able to add on nifty upgrades to make your suit even more advanced. </p>
      <h3>Doom Eternal</h3>

      <p>Following up from the events of 2016's Doom, Doom Eternal looks to offer much of the same - and that's no bad thing. Doom Eternal is the fast-paced, ultra-violent sequel that everyone has been waiting for, and boasts a larger roster of Hellish enemies, more weapons and new mechanics that'll change the way that you play Doom games forever. Oh, and the introduction of a new game mode that puts online players in your single-player campaign as Demons is coming too. Sounds fun, right?</p>

      <p>So, obviously this is a remake of the 1997 game Final Fantasy VII, which follows mercenary Cloud Strife as he, and eco-terrorist group AVALANCHE, battle against the Shinra megacorporation and former Shinra soldier, Sephiroth. But what's different from the original? Well, updated graphics obviously, along with remade character designs, additional quests and a revised combat system. </p>
      <h3>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</h3>

      <p>It'll have been nearly eight years since the last main Animal Crossing once New Horizons is released, so it's no wonder that the internet had a collective meltdown when this was announced (albeit <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/news/game/animal-crossing-new-horizons-release-delay-3697960/">delayed until 2020</a>). You'll be taking part in the Nook Inc. Deserted Island Getaway Package, where you'll be able to craft your own resources, customise your own home and enjoy lots of island-themed activities like fishing and gardening. Also, it looks absolutely adorable, as usual. </p>

      <p>CD Projekt Red is going big with its follow-up to The Witcher trilogy: a massive open-world, first-person, cyberpunk sci-fi game based on a cult tabletop RPG. Known about for years but only revealed for the first time at E3 2018, Cyberpunk looks like one of the most ambitious RPGs ever made, combining dense progression systems, branching narratives, and fast-paced FPS combat into one sprawling whole. Oh yeah, and it features the breathtaking Keanu Reeves. We're ready to move to Night City now, please.</p>

      <p>After Marvel's Spider-Man was a smash hit on the PS4, Marvel Games are taking things a step further. That's right - The Avengers are assembling on the big consoles. Experience all the different super powers across some of the most iconic moments from the Marvel comics. Plus, we'll also be getting the addition of fan favourite Kamala Khan, AKA Ms. Marvel. The developers have also promised that this game will be optimised for more content for the next few years, making this superhero title an investment for gamers all around. </p>

      <p>The Last Of Us has been considered as one of the greatest video games of all time, so the sequel certainly has a lot to live up to. Set five years after its predecessor, Ellie and Joel have settled down in Jackson, Wyoming, and found peace amongst a small community. However, an event will turn all of this on its head, putting Ellie through a difficult and traumatic journey. With upgraded gameplay, new weapons and a compelling story, we think this is going to be something special. </p>

      <p>Dying Light proved to be a pretty great zombie game, and the sequel will only build on this even further. Advancements in the plot, combat gameplay and world should give you everything you need to go out and face the undead. The game will also be getting a Left 4 Dead 2 crossover, including using a guitar as a weapon to slay zombies with - pretty rockin. </p>

      <p>One of the most anticipated games of 2020 has unfortunately been delayed until the latter half of the year. The third instalment in the Watch Dog series, this will be set in a post-Brexit London in which players have a choice of five main storylines and numerous protagonists. Each character's stats will be influenced by their backstory, and allegedly you'll be able to recruit and play as any NPC in the game. Watch Dogs Legion will also feature multiplayer, though we're still waiting for more information on this. </p>

      <p>The studio behind the renowned Assassins Creed: Odyssey are coming with a new storybook adventure that's giving us big Zelda vibes. According to the trailer, you'll be on a quest to save some Greek gods, and at some point face off against a big freaky looking bird creature. Other than that, we don't know too much yet. But, we're pretty hopeful that this'll be one to watch. </p>

      <p>The first game on this list for the next-gen consoles, Halo Infinite, will mark the return of Master Chief, but also allegedly a spiritual reboot for the entire franchise - which is very intriguing. As of yet we have no footage of any gameplay elements; the trailer above was more just an announcement that the game is a thing. But stay tuned. </p>
