      <h1>Diablo IV will feature a shared open world with five regions and a non-linear campaign</h1>
      <h2>Plus 'hundreds of legendary items'</h2>

      <p>The veil has been lifted from the "mystery panels" at BlizzCon, and following the opening ceremony, Blizzard is leading with what is arguably the biggest news out of BlizzCon: <i><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../blizzard-confirms-diablo-iv-to-open-up-blizzcon-2019-571179.phtml">Diablo IV</a></i>. The project was allegedly "held back" from being shown off early at BlizzCon 2018 in favor of the tumultuous <i>Diablo Immortal</i> mobile gambit, and now we're getting a proper reveal with a full cinematic trailer and gameplay.</p>
      <p>Although they couldn't really get into it in detail during the opening ceremony, thanks to the panel we now know that the latest iteration of <i>Diablo</i> is far more ambitious than past entries. For starters it features a "non-linear campaign," that has a shared open world with five regions. Blizzard claims that there will be "hundreds of dungeons and legendaries" in tow, which inspired a cheer from the crowd. The development team is "leading into legendaries" and stepping away from sets (good) for more build variety.</p>
      <p>The barbarian, druid, and sorceress are the first three confirmed classes, and will feature both gender options like <i>Diablo III</i>. The development team acknowledged that they pissed a lot of people off by not including the druid in <i>Diablo III</i>, and this time he'll keep his companions (like the raven and wolves), as well as magical elemental abilities and shapeshifting. The latter will be done seamlessly, and mid-swing you can transform into a new form. Blizzard is calling it an evolution of everything they've learned so far from <i>Diablo</i>'s combat systems. Talent trees are in too, as are mounts and the ability to waypoint travel.</p>
      <p>In theory this is a slam dunk. It's using all of the good mechanical upgrades from <i>Diablo III</i> and then some on top of the "dark" theme everyone wanted from <i>Diablo I </i>and <i>II</i>. It'll be really interesting to see how it stands up against <i>Path of Exile</i>, the current king of ARPGs. The key? Keeping it updated and relevant for years on end, like Grinding Gear Games has for <i>Path of Exile</i>: which is still free, by the way.</p>
      <p>PC, PS4, and Xbox One are confirmed, but there is no release window. "Not even Blizzard Soon (TM)" is a direct quote from the panel.</p>
