      <h1>Uber used Bitcoin to pay $100K hacker ransom in 2017, court docs confirm</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T15:04:10+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 15:04</time> by <a rel="author">Yessi Bello Perez</a></address>
      <p>Uber used Bitcoin to pay hackers who held sensitive data for ransom, court documents have confirmed.</p>
      <p>As a result, two men pleaded guilty to charges of computer hacking and extortion, bringing a lengthy legal saga that embroiled Uber and LinkedIn-owned training site Lynda.com in costly data breaches to a close.</p>
      <p>To access the companies‘ servers, the hackers gained access to customer information by using Amazon Web Services logins belonging to Uber and Lynda.com employees.</p>
      <p>They then contacted both companies to extort them for hundreds of dollars‘ worth of Bitcoin.</p>
      <p>At the time, Uber agreed to pay $100,000 in the cryptocurrency. The payment was processed via the tech giant’s HackerOne bug bounty program, and Uber required the hackers to sign a confidentiality agreement preventing them from using the data and publicly disclosing the security breach.</p>
      <p>Vasile Mereacre, from Canada, and Brandon Glover, from Florida, were <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/10/26/uber-breach-linkedin-lynda-indictment/">indicted</a> last year after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/30/technology/uber-lyndacom-hacks-guilty-plea.html">stealing information</a> of 55,000 accounts from Lynda.com, which unlike Uber, refused to pay.</p>
      <p>It was then revealed that both men were also the perpetrators of a 2016 Uber breach that compromised the data of 57 millions users.</p>
      <p>Uber <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/nov/21/uber-data-hack-cyber-attack">kept the security breach private</a> for over a year, until November 2017,  when its new leadership became aware of the cover-up and decided to go public.</p>
      <p>As a result, the company received <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/sep/26/uber-hack-fine-driver-data-breach">a hefty $148 million fine</a> and had to agree to 20 years of privacy audits.</p>
      <p>Uber also fired its chief security officer Joe Sullivan, who orchestrated the payments and failed to alert company users about the security breach.</p>
      <p>The New York Times says both men, who are due to be sentenced next year, could face <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/30/technology/uber-lyndacom-hacks-guilty-plea.html">a maximum sentence of up to five years</a> in federal prison and could be fined up to $250,000.</p>
