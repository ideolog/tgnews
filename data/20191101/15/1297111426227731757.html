      <h2>Saskatchewan Roughriders head coach Craig Dickenson is unfailingly, applaudably honest with the people who play for and cover the team.</h2>

      <p>Craig Dickenson was honest when asked about his penchant for honesty.</p>
      <p>“I’m not a good BS’er, I guess,” the Saskatchewan Roughriders’ first-year head coach said.</p>
      <p>“I just feel like when people ask you a question, you do your best to answer it truthfully and honestly, and if you don’t feel comfortable answering it, you just tell them so.</p>
      <p>“I don’t really know why I’m that way. I just am.”</p>
      <p>Thank goodness for that. In a day and age when so many football coaches opt for obfuscation or obstinacy, Dickenson is a refreshing change. Ask him a question and you shall receive a forthright, informative response, with more than a sprinkle of humanity.</p>
      <p>Dickenson is not a dispenser of pigskin pablum such as “we’re on to Cincinnati” or “our goal is to go 1-and-0 this week.” He understands that the media is a conduit to the fans — the lifeblood of a community-owned franchise — and strives to keep the paying public informed.</p>
      <p>Sure, there are times when sensitive information is withheld, but it is done respectfully. And he isn’t going to give away the playbook, simply because some ink-stained scribbler poses a question relating to strategy.</p>
      <p>However, Dickenson will peel back some layers and provide as much insight as possible without compromising preparations for the upcoming game.</p>
      <p>If a player has a concussion, Dickenson isn’t inclined to resort to “upper-body injury.” When quarterback Zach Collaros was concussed early this season, it was Dickenson who provided confirmation, as was the case after linebacker Cameron Judge sustained a blow to the head on Saturday.</p>

      <p>Dickenson’s candour is not reserved for the media. It is part of his modus operandi when dealing with the players.</p>
      <p>“Even kids, but especially grown men, they just want the truth,” Dickenson said. “If you’re honest with people and tell them up-front how you feel and what you see, I think they can live with good news and bad news. That’s just my style and so far it has worked OK.”</p>
      <p>Has it ever. The Roughriders’ double-digit victory total is especially impressive when you consider what has transpired during the 2019 calendar year.</p>
      <p>Only one week after signing a contract extension, Chris Jones stepped down in January to join the Cleveland Browns’ coaching staff. Suddenly, the Roughriders were without a head coach, defensive co-ordinator, general manager and vice-president of football operations.</p>
      <p>Jeremy O’Day was quickly promoted to fill the latter two positions. His first major move as the GM was to hire Dickenson as the head coach.</p>
      <p>The Roughriders were unexpectedly shifting gears in the middle of the winter, while attempting to address the one major void that Jones had left behind.</p>
      <p>Who was going to play quarterback?</p>
      <p>Collaros was re-signed on Feb. 11, after O’Day unsuccessfully tried to woo marquee signal-caller Bo Levi Mitchell away from Calgary, and there were yawns.</p>
      <p>O’Day also added a quarterback named Cody Fajardo, who had been a short-yardage specialist for most of his first three full CFL seasons. Fajardo was thrust into front-line duty much earlier than anyone had expected, after Collaros suffered a concussion on just the third play of the regular season.</p>

      <p>In came Fajardo, whose passing prowess didn’t initially lead to victories.</p>
      <p>The Roughriders had records of 0-2 and 1-3 before going on a 9-1 roll that enabled them to nail down a playoff berth during what appeared at one point to be a transitional year.</p>
      <p>“Coach Dickenson is so positive, and it creates a positive energy,” said Fajardo, himself a beacon of honesty. “Guys want to be here.</p>
      <p>“Guys don’t think of this as work. They think of this as football, which it should be. It’s a sport. We’re playing a game for money, which is incredible. We’re very blessed to do so and a lot of guys realize that.”</p>
      <p>Dickenson echoed those sentiments when asked about his openness to publicly critiquing, and even lamenting, some of his own tactical decisions. Many head coaches would rather attend a Kevin James film festival than second-guess themselves in front of the jackals of the media. But Dickenson, as you have likely ascertained by now, isn’t a typical football field boss — simply an excellent one.</p>
      <p>“I think you have to be honest with yourself,” the down-to-earth Montanan said. “I’m not afraid of failure.</p>
      <p>“I feel very fortunate to be able to coach the Saskatchewan Roughriders. I felt very fortunate to be able to coach when I was an assistant coach. I felt very fortunate when I was a student coach.</p>
      <p>“I’ve got a good life, I’ve got a good job, and I want to be the best I can. Being honest with yourself is a good way to start.”</p>
