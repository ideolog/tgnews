      <p>Coming off last night's New Moon in Scorpio, the urge to purge and start fresh continues with the Sun in passionate Scorpio opposing unconventional Uranus in Taurus in the early A.M. Meanwhile, the Moon remains in Scorpio, putting us in the mood to pursue our passions and our deepest desires.</p>
      <p>With the Moon teaming up with responsible Saturn in Capricorn by the late afternoon, we get the determination and the grit needed to overcome challenges and turn something we've been wanting into a reality. By the evening, the Scorpio Moon teams up with dreamy Neptune in Pisces, providing us with a respite after a busy day. When the Moon and Neptune get together, it's also a time to do something kind for others or anything that fills up our heart space.</p>

      <p>You might find yourself ready to take a new approach to your finances now, which could include a switch in your savings plan or the chance to get rid of a debt or financial obligation faster. Recognize that you deserve to thrive, not merely survive. Don't let crisis be a motivator.</p>
      <h3>If Your Zodiac Sign Is Taurus (April 20 - May 20)</h3>

      <p>You might have to strike a balance today between needing to do things you're own way and needing to work with or rely on others. Not that you should second-guess yourself, but for now, having the help of those close to you can get you where you need to go. Be open to compromise.</p>
      <h3>If Your Zodiac Sign Is Gemini (May 21 - June 20)</h3>

      <p>You may be feeling a bit anxious or unsettled today, but it's a clear indication that you need to take time to focus on your well-being. If something has been weighing heavily on you, it's time to discuss it with someone that can help you work through it. Self-care is your priority.</p>
      <h3>If Your Zodiac Sign Is Cancer (June 21 - July 22)</h3>

      <p>You might find yourself feeling creatively inspired today, which can help you turn a creative project into gold or break out of a creative rut. Now's the time for you to take some chances with something you've been envisioning and dare to bring something different to the table.</p>

      <p>Your energy may not be as high as you'd like to be and that's not necessarily a bad thing. You're being called to pay closer attention to how you're spending your time and energy, especially if you're feeling burned out. Take time to nourish yourself. Quitting isn't a bad thing.</p>
      <h3>If Your Zodiac Sign Is Virgo (Aug. 23 - Sept. 22)</h3>

      <p>You've got the gift of gab now, giving you the chance to make an impact with your thoughts, words, and ideas. As such, don't be shy about thinking outside of the box. You might even need to take a risk and initiate a conversation if you want to see results. People are listening.</p>
      <h3>If Your Zodiac Sign Is Libra (Sept. 23 - Oct. 22)</h3>

      <p>You've got big plans when it comes to your career and if you're going to make them happen, you're going to have to reach down deep and do the work. However, take care that what you're going after isn't someone else's version of success. You define what's important to you.</p>
      <h3>If Your Zodiac Sign Is Scorpio (Oct. 23 - Nov. 21)</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://imgix.bustle.com/2017/5/30/87b32cc7-3c06-4784-b010-e307cdf49bcd.png?w=646&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;q=70"/>
        <figcaption>Tina Gong/Bustle</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>You're called to put yourself and your needs first today, which may mean having an uncomfortable conversation with another. Now's the time for breaking free of those that pull too much on your energy or can't offer your the consistency you need. Be discerning with your time.</p>
      <h3>If Your Zodiac Sign Is Sagittarius (Nov. 22 - Dec. 21)</h3>

        <img src="https://imgix.bustle.com/2017/3/3/d13210b7-56a1-4dac-9632-229e4a5933e8.png?w=646&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;q=70"/>
        <figcaption>Tina Gong/Bustle</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>You might be feeling a bit moody blue today, namely when it comes to getting something or someone you want. Recognize the delay you're experiencing isn't about denying you what you want; it's helping you to see that you deserve much more. Hold out for something better.</p>
      <h3>If Your Zodiac Sign Is Capricorn (Dec. 22 - Jan. 19)</h3>

        <figcaption>Tina Gong/Bustle</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>You may need to exercise some boundaries today when it comes to someone that may be demanding too much of your time and attention. On another note, someone could show you where you may be a little too rigid or fearful right now. This insight could be enlightening.</p>

      <p>Did you know that perfectionism could be a form of procrastination? You may be reminded of this today if you've been dragging your feet on getting something done, either waiting for the perfect time to do it or for you to be able to do it perfectly. Don't let fear get in your way.</p>
      <h3>If Your Zodiac Sign Is Pisces (Feb. 19 - March 20)</h3>

      </p>
      <p>The Moon finishes her transit through passionate and seductive Scorpio today, keying up our desires and the need to have exactly what we want or nothing at all. These feelings will be all the more potent by the late morning, when the Moon teams up with love planet Venus in Scorpio.</p>
      <p>With the Moon and Venus in Scorpio, we should also find ourselves craving deeper intimacy in our relationships and this planetary combination can help us to find it. However, establishing that intimacy may require vulnerability or facing something that we've been avoiding.</p>
      <p>By the afternoon, the Moon teams up with intuitive Mercury in Scorpio, pushing us to have necessary conversations that can help us to suss out the truth, foster healing, or deepen the bond we share with another. If we're engaged in an activity that requires focus, research, and problem-solving skills, this Moon-Mercury combo can help.</p>
      <p>By the early evening, the Moon enters happy-go-lucky Sagittarius which should lighten up the vibes and shift us into a good mood. With the Moon in Sagittarius, we'll be in the mood for some good times and adventures. With the Sagittarius Moon joining forces with wounded Chiron in Aries later tonight, fun and adventure could be a source of healing.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The Moon is in adventurous and freedom-loving Sagittarius today, putting us in the mood to take a big risk and live life unfiltered. However, with communication planet Mercury scheduled to go retrograde tomorrow in cautious and cunning Scorpio, we're also called to be a little more thoughtful about our decisions.</p>
      <p>Plus, with Mercury meeting up with love planet Venus in Scorpio by the evening, we should all be sure to read the fine print when it comes to making or entering contracts or new agreements. At the same time, this Mercury-Venus combo can help us to be more discerning about what we really want rather than settling for a temporary fix or something unsatisfying.</p>
      <p>With the Moon in Sagittarius and multiple planets in Scorpio, the focus is on seeing and acknowledging the truth. This may be hard to do when the Moon squares off with hazy Neptune in Pisces, which could confuse things. The best way to use this planetary combo is for anything creative or anything that has meditative benefits.</p>

      <p>You could receive some good news today regarding a financial matter that could either take a weight off of your shoulders or provide you with the freedom to do something you really want to do. Meanwhile, be careful of promising more than you can deliver now. Baby steps are needed.</p>

      <p>A conversation between you and your partner or someone that you're trying to build a rapport with can go well today. However, it will require honesty from both parties.

        <i> or how each sign handles conflict in relationships. Below, a look at how astrology will affect our lives today.</i>
      </p>
      <p>It's a big day today ghouls and goblins, not just because the Moon is in bountiful and growth-oriented Sagittarius. It's also Halloween around these parts and the day when communicative Mercury officially begins its retrograde in deep and mysterious Scorpio, which could bring some skeletons out of the closet. However, that doesn't necessarily have to be a bad thing, as Mercury retrograde in Scorpio is here to help us to get to the bottom of things.</p>
      <p>From now until Nov. 20, Mercury retrograde in Scorpio will be pushing us to dive into the depths and retrace our steps, uncovering secrets and other key details or information that we may have missed while Mercury was moving direct.</p>
      <p>Between the Moon being in Sagittarius for most of the day and Mercury being in Scorpio, the focus for today (and for the next few weeks) is uncovering and facing the truth. Remember, things become less frightening when we're willing to face them head on. And although Scorpio season can be a time when our fears seem to hold more weight than usual, know that Scorpio also gives us the courage and determination to conquer them.</p>
      <p>When the Moon moves to responsible Capricorn by late tonight, the focus will be on paying attention to the facts and making our decisions with caution, care, and personal responsibility. And with Capricorn being a sign that appreciates hard work and commitment, this retrograde will also be good for reevaluating our commitments, reassessing our goals, and refining anything that we've already been working on.</p>
      <p>Since Mercury retrograde is a time where the chances for miscommunication, travel delays, and errors in judgement are higher than usual, this isn't an ideal time for starting brand new projects, entering into agreements, or making snap decisions. This is a time for slowing down, assessing the situation, and double-checking facts so our past doesn't come back to haunt us. Of course, if we want to revisit an old haunt or two, this is a good time to do it.</p>

      <p>An ex or someone from your past could come back from the "dead" now, which could help foster a long, overdue conversation or remind you why this person needs to remain a part of your past. Though a reconciliation is possible too. Honor the truth and be bold with it.</p>

      <p>OK, let's talk about something that really scares you: slowing down.

      <p>A former flame could come back to haunt you now, but know that you don't have to answer the call or let them back in. Use the power of your better judgement and see this person as they really are. If coupled, this could be a good time to rekindle the magic. Too, revisit a creative project.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The Moon remains in pragmatic Capricorn today, putting much of the emphasis on work, productivity, and our ambitions. Considering this lunar placement, we should find ourselves looking to put in the hard work and dedication to achieve success where we want to see success the most in our lives.</p>
      <p>The Moon in Capricorn teams up with unconventional Uranus in Taurus at the start of the day which can help us to initiate new projects or take a new approach towards achieving a goal. By the late afternoon, the Moon teams up with the Sun in passionate Scorpio, which can help us to find the determination we need to clear obstacles in our path or overcome a challenge.</p>
      <p>Still, the biggest planetary shift of the day occurs later in the afternoon when love planet Venus leaves the depths of Scorpio for happy-go-lucky Sagittarius. With Venus in Sagittarius for the next few weeks, we should find that the people and things that we value most are associated with themes like travel, adventure, generosity, learning and philosophy, and growth.</p>
      <p>Read below to see what the stars mean for your sign today, and make sure to check out your <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/your-november-2019-monthly-horoscope-17894181">November 2019 monthly horoscope</a>.</p>
