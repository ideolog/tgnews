      <p>Conor McGregor has been fined €1,000 for assaulting a man in a pub in Dublin.</p>
      <p>The mixed martial arts fighter pleaded guilty to a single charge of assault on Friday.</p>
      <p>Dublin District Court earlier heard that the victim, Desmond Keogh, did not want to give a victim impact statement.</p>
      <p>The court was told that McGregor apologised to the victim and paid him compensation, however the amount was not disclosed to the court.</p>
      <p>CCTV footage of the incident was played to the court.</p>
      <p>McGregor’s solicitor Michael Staines said that his client accepted what he did was wrong and fully accepts the incident.</p>
      <p>He told the court that the victim did not suffer any physical injury.</p>
      <p>McGregor stood up in the court to address the judge.</p>
      <p>He said what he did was “very wrong” and that he would like to apologise to the victim and to the court.</p>
      <p>“I assure you nothing of this nature will happen again,” he added.</p>
