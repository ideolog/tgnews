      <p>One couple from San Francisco is proving that early retirement is indeed possible.<br/><br/>They're part of the group of people joining what's called the FIRE Movement.<br/><br/>Christina and Amon Browning have two kids -- Sunoa and Melea.<br/><br/>They're already retired at just 40 years old.<br/><br/>"I was making $98,000 a year and Christina was making about $70,000," Amon said.<br/><br/>Now they're living their retirement dream in Portugal.<br/><br/>So, how did they make it happen?<br/><br/>They're part of the FIRE Movement -- which stands for Financial Independence, Retire Early.<br/><br/>It's all about maximizing savings and generating passive income so your money works for you instead of the other way around.<br/><br/>"There's more to life than just sitting in my cubicle," Amon said.<br/><br/>"When he told me that I was like, 'ok, I've never heard of this, this sounds so bizarre,' but it was like maybe we can do this," said Christina.<br/><br/>The Brownings were able to save more than $2 million in just 8 years by investing 70 percent of their income, flipping fixer uppers, trading in their expensive BMW for a used minivan and earning thousands more while driving for Uber and Lyft.<br/><br/>They've been sharing their journey along the way with over 100,000 followers on YouTube and Instagram.<br/><br/>"We just thought this would be a pretty fun project to do," said Christina. "Share our story, share our journey and reach people and tell them there's an alternative to working these long hours."<br/><br/>Now they spend their days eating breakfast as a family, walking their daughters to school, traveling and learning Portuguese.</p>
