      <p>One couple from San Francisco is proving that early retirement is indeed possible.</p>
      <p>They're part of the group of people joining what's called the FIRE Movement.</p>
      <p>Christina and Amon Browning have two kids -- Sunoa and Melea.</p>
      <p>They're already retired at just 40 years old.</p>
      <p>"I was making $98,000 a year and Christina was making about $70,000," Amon said.</p>
      <p>Now they're living their retirement dream in Portugal.</p>
      <p>So, how did they make it happen?</p>
      <p>They're part of the FIRE Movement -- which stands for Financial Independence, Retire Early.</p>
      <p>It's all about maximizing savings and generating passive income so your money works for you instead of the other way around.</p>
      <p>"There's more to life than just sitting in my cubicle," Amon said.</p>
      <p>"When he told me that I was like, 'ok, I've never heard of this, this sounds so bizarre,' but it was like maybe we can do this," said Christina.</p>
      <p>The Brownings were able to save more than $2 million in just 8 years by investing 70 percent of their income, flipping fixer uppers, trading in their expensive BMW for a used minivan and earning thousands more while driving for Uber and Lyft.</p>
      <p>They've been sharing their journey along the way with over 100,000 followers on YouTube and Instagram.</p>
      <p>"We just thought this would be a pretty fun project to do," said Christina. "Share our story, share our journey and reach people and tell them there's an alternative to working these long hours."</p>
      <p>Now they spend their days eating breakfast as a family, walking their daughters to school, traveling and learning Portuguese.</p>
