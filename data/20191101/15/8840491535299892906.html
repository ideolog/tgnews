      <p>THREE companies were fined a total of €32,000 by Judge Rory MacCabe at the Circuit Criminal Court in Castlebar today (Friday) for health and safety related breaches following the death of a young electrician last year.</p>
      <p>Lorcan Deasy (31), Errew, Castlebar, sustained serious head injuries when he fell from a height at the CMS Distribution plant in Kiltimagh on January 15, 2018. He died in Beaumont Hospital, Dublin, seven days later.</p>
      <p>Mr. Deasy was working for Ivan Kelly Electrics, Kiltimagh, at CMS Distribution, Bohola Road, Kiltimagh, when the accident occurred.</p>
      <p>As a result of the tragedy, prosecutions were brought by the Health and Safety Authority against CMS Distribution, Ivan Kelly Electrics and Vincent Burke Construction, Cloonlee, Knock.</p>
      <p>A previous court was told by Mr. Patrick Reynolds, counsel for the DPP, that refurbishments were taking place in the CMS Distribution building when the accident occurred.</p>
      <p>Mr. Reynolds said the accident was not witnessed by anybody as Mr. Deasy was alone at the time but an employee of CMS heard a loud bang, similar to a ladder falling.</p>
      <p>All three defendants appeared before Judge MacCabe for sentencing today (Friday) on signed pleas of guilty.</p>
      <p>Mr. Ronan Kennedy, counsel for CMS Distribution, expressed the company’s deep and profound regret that the tragedy, which had cast long shadows over the company and its operations, had occurred.</p>
      <p>The company, Mr. Kennedy explained, has strong roots in the community and has been in Kiltimagh for 30 years. It employs 93 locally, 20 in Dublin and 375 worldwide.</p>
      <p>Mr. Kennedy said it was a source of severe embarrassment to the company that it did not appreciate the necessity to appoint a project supervisor in writing.</p>
      <p>Significant lessons had been learned from the tragedy and the company had undertaken a comprehensive safety review.</p>
      <p>Mr. Brendan McDonagh, counsel for Ivan Kelly, said that at all times the defendant was fully and unconditionally accepted his role in the matter and met the case fully and openly.</p>
      <p>Mr. Diarmuid Connolly, counsel for Vincent Burke, said Mr. Burke, who had failed to erect a warning sign on an incomplete scaffolding apparatus, was deeply saddened and upset over what happened..</p>
      <p>Lessons had been learned, safety standards had been reviewed and all matters of health and safety were now in force, counsel stated.</p>
      <p>Prior to imposing penalties, Judge MacCabe commented: “Mr. Deasy need not have lost his life on this day but he did. He went to work and didn’t come home.”</p>
      <p>CMS Distribution was fined €2,000 for its failure to appoint in writing a competent project supervisor.</p>
      <p>The judge said he assessed Ivan Kelly’s culpability at a higher level and fined him €10,000 on each of two health and safety breaches relating to having an unsafe system at work resulting in death.</p>
      <p>The third defendant, Vincent Burke, was fined €10,000 for not having a warning sign on the scaffolding structure. Had he done so, the risk would have been significantly reduced, the judge said.</p>
      <p>Judge MacCabe imposed costs totalling €3,867.14 on the defendants.</p>
      <p>He expressed his personal sympathy to the family of the deceased.</p>
