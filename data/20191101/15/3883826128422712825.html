      <h1>Why are real people acting like 'Boris bots'?</h1>

        <b>Thousands of nearly identical messages of support for Boris Johnson are being posted to Facebook pages.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It's prompted concerns about whether "bots", or automated inauthentic accounts, are being used to try to sway voters.</p>
      <p>While bots do exist, the BBC has spoken to real people, both for and against Brexit, who have posted such comments.</p>
      <p>They're doing it because they think it's funny - and to try to trick the other side.</p>
      <h3>What do the messages say?</h3>
      <p>The bot-like messages say things like "I support Boris 100%" and "Brilliant!". They appear, as above, on the prime minister's own Facebook page, as well as on the pages of news outlets.</p>

      <p>There is similar activity on Jeremy Corbyn's official page but it is not nearly at the level as on Johnson's, which is liked by more than 700,000 people.</p>

      <h3>Stranger things</h3>
      <p>On some Johnson posts something even stranger is going on.</p>
      <p>Lots of similar comments have appeared which include odd symbols and characters.</p>

      <p>To the untrained eye this looks like a faulty line of code - a broken "Boris bot".</p>
      <p>So what's really going on?</p>
      <h3>Not all bots</h3>
      <p>Some of the Boris "supporters" might actually be the result of automated activity, although there's no indication that anyone inside the prime minister's campaign is behind it.</p>
      <p>William Dance, a linguistics and fake news expert at Lancaster University says Johnson's page shows "signs of inauthentic behaviour, with repetitious and duplicate comments."</p>

      <p>But many of the accounts are real people, with fleshed-out authentic-looking profiles.</p>
      <p>Why are they flooding social media with spammy messages?</p>
      <p>It may have started as a trick.</p>
      <h3>'Driving Remainers crazy'</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/Fight4Brexit/">Fight4Brexit</a> is a page with almost 100,000 members.</p>
      <p>John Johnston, a political reporter for Politics Home, <a href="https://twitter.com/johnjohnstonmi/status/1171409897986187265?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1171409897986187265&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.totalpolitics.com%2Farticles%2Fdiary%2Fmassive-bot-army-behind-wave-i-support-boris-messages">spotted last month that this page has been directly encouraging people to post bot-like messages because they are "driving Remainers crazy"</a>.</p>
      <p>The idea, apparently, is to anger anti-Brexit activists by making it appear that a bot army is flooding Facebook.</p>

      <h3>What about that strange code?</h3>
      <p>But it appears that the other side caught on - which explains those weird code-like messages.</p>
      <p>For example, this tweet was shared more than 3,000 times last week and appears to show a "malfunctioning bot" with the name Dan Bunting.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/socialembed/https://twitter.com/Challengeitnow/status/1187607877281812480~/news/blogs-trending-50218615"/>

      <p>But the BBC messaged Mr Bunting and verified his identity. He's a masters student from the UK currently living in Sweden with his partner.</p>
      <p>"I am not a bot - it was just a satirical comment," he says.</p>
      <p>Mr Bunting told the BBC he supports Brexit, "but not the way it is behind handled".</p>
      <h3>Real or not real?</h3>
      <p>Some of those fake "malfunctioning bots" are simply a response to the fake "pro-Boris bots".</p>
      <p>But others posting those code-like messages say they're highlighting the presence of fake accounts.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>The BBC contacted Jake Graham, the person who posted above, who replied quickly to say his message was "just a joke". But it had a serious point.</p>
      <p>Mr Graham, from Preston in Lancashire, says he opposes Brexit and that he made the comment to highlight what he thinks is dubious activity on Johnson's page.</p>
      <p>"I've followed Boris for years on Facebook since he was Mayor of London and spotted so many comments that looked like bots," says Graham. "I thought I would make one to make it look like my programming had malfunctioned."</p>
      <h3>Bot or not?</h3>
      <p>Even if most of the pro-Boris and anti-Boris messages aren't actually posted by bots, that doesn't mean automated campaigns aren't a problem, says William Dance, the fake news expert.</p>
      <p>"Facebook has a major bot problem" he says. "In the first quarter of 2019 alone, Facebook removed over 2 billion inauthentic accounts. This is was almost as many takedowns as Facebook has daily active users."</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, when actual people pretend to be bots, it's even more difficult to distinguish real accounts from fake ones.</p>
