      <p><a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Yami-Gautam">Yami Gautam</a> and Bhumi Pednekar are all set to star in Amar Kaushik's 'Bala'. The film faced flak on social media with several users commenting on how the makers could have cast someone else instead of giving Bhumi a tan through make-up. Talking about the same, Yami said, "No I do not agree with that at all. I feel that she’s a fantastic actor and I’m sure when a director is casting for his film the first and foremost pre requisite is that actor creatively fits into that part or not. If Amar thought of Bhumi, it was for on the basis of her talent. The physical aspect of it, it is not possible for any actor or for any director to, I am not saying it’s impossible but very unlikely that you’ll physically see an actor walking into or looking like your character what you have visioned."</p>
