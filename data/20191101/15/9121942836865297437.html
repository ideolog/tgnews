      <h1>What’s best for America? Focus on common good, not individuals</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T15:24:11+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 15:24</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.seattletimes.com/author/letters-coordinator/" target="_blank">Letters editor</a></address>
      <p>The question was never, and never should have been, are <i>you</i> better off now than you were four years ago? The question must be, is <i>America</i> better off now?</p>
      <p>Are we better off now than four years ago? Are we better, kinder, more decent? Is the world a safer place? If you pledge allegiance to the flag, if you sing our anthem with pride and joy, if you celebrate the Fourth of July with pride — for all those who have suffered and died for our country, for our Constitution, for all the leadership we have tried to provide to make this a better and freer world — you must defend our Constitution.</p>
      <p>You must believe that defending our Constitution is your responsibility to your country. The price of freedom is vigilance. Ignorance and apathy are the death of any republic.</p>
