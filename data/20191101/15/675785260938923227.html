      <h1>Jurgen Klopp admits concerns over Fabinho's availability for Man City clash</h1>
      <h2>The midfielder is in contention for the trip to Villa Park but Klopp has already foreseen a potential problem</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T15:17:05+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 15:17</time> by <a rel="author">Darren Wells, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/darren-wells/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jurgen-klopp">Jurgen Klopp</a> has admitted he faces a selection dilemma involving <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fabinho">Fabinho</a> for Liverpool's clash with Aston Villa.</p>
      <p>The Reds are looking to maintain their unbeaten start to the season with a trip to the promoted club on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Klopp has been re-jigging his side to deal with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool's</a> Champions League and Carabao Cup commitments.</p>
      <p>But despite resting Fabinho in midweek, he revealed the Brazilian might not play due to his disciplinary record.</p>
      <p>Liverpool's next fixture is against title rivals Man City next week, and Fabinho has already collected four bookings in the Premier League this season.</p>

      <p>A yellow card against Villa on Saturday would result in the midfielder being suspended for the top-of-the-table clash with City.</p>
      <p>And Klopp was unsure whether he was willing to take that risk.</p>
      <p>Asked how he would deal with his problem, Klopp joked: "No challenges at all."</p>
      <p>Before adding: "It's not possible against Aston Villa, playing without challenges in that position. You cannot ask for this. Player knows it, I know it.</p>

      <p>"It's information we have to deal with. Maybe he has to deal with it or I have to deal with it with the line-up.</p>
      <p>"I didn't make a decision yet, so we will see."</p>
      <p>Should Fabinho be rested for the occasion it is likely that either Jordan Henderson or Georginio Wijnaldum would slot into the holding midfield role.</p>
      <p>That would leave a space for one of James Milner, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain or Adam Lallana to start.</p>

      <p>Milner and Lallana both played the whole match against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> on Wednesday, with the latter occupying the holding role.</p>
      <p>It was only the second time Lallana had played in that position in competitive action for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> however, and it is doubtful that Klopp would play him there against Villa.</p>
      <p>Oxlade-Chamberlain has been pushing for a start with three goals in his last two outings, but Klopp insisted he wanted more from the player.</p>
      <p>"He has scored, nice, both at Genk, a real stunner on Wednesday, a lot of outstanding moments, but other moments he is not involved," Klopp said.</p>
      <p>"We always have to try to reach perfection. He still needs rhythm but that is no problem. He is a long-term project."</p>
      <p>Naby Keita picked up an injury against Arsenal, but could still make the squad.</p>
      <p>Klopp said: "Naby, I don't know [if he will be fit], we will see."</p>
