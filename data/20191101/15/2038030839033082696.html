      <p>Taking to the stage to give thanks, Dr Kani said he was privileged to see other actors speak words from plays that he had written and take on roles that he had done in the past. </p>
      <p>"I looked around, and I just felt like James (Ncgobo) is a good man," he said, adding: "Do these people really look up to me? Then I am blessed. I am truly blessed."</p>

      <p>On why they chose to honour Dr Kani, Empowaworx said it was essential to recognise legends while they are still around.</p>
      <p>"As South Africans, we have the tendency to celebrate our icons when they are no longer with us. And it is because of this that we as Empowaworx and The Speakers Firm have designed an offering with the sole purpose of honouring and paying tribute to our legends such as Dr John Kani for their creativity and their contribution to the industry."  </p>
