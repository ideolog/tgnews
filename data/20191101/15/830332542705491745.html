      <p>(CNN) - Ohio police are urging trick-or-treaters to carefully sift through their Halloween stash after two people said they found razor blades hidden inside candy wrappers.</p>
      <p>One of the people found a blade and cut a finger while sorting through their candy on Halloween night, Colerain Township Police spokesman James Love told CNN. The person went to the hospital for stitches. No one else was injured.</p>
      <p>The two people who found the blades had trick-or-treated together in the same neighborhood in the Cincinnati suburb, Sgt. Scott Owen told CNN affiliate WLWT. They're not sure which of the houses handed out the tampered candy.</p>
      <p>The blades were hidden inside the wrappers of two candy bars, Love said.</p>
      <p>That same night in Waterbury, Connecticut, police arrested a man after razor blades were found in the bottom of two trick-or-treaters' candy bags, CNN affiliate WTIC reported.</p>
      <h3>Finding razors and poison in candy</h3>
      <p>Reports of hidden blades and laced candy have spooked parents of trick-or-treaters and officials for decades. But there have only been a few scattered incidents.</p>
      <p>A 2014 review of reports of "Halloween sadism" found no children had died or been seriously injured from purported Halloween poisonings or planted razors.</p>
