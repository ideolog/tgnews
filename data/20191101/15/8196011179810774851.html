      <p>An international law enforcement agency which is battling major drug trafficking has presented a prestigious award to a senior Cork-based garda for his work in this field.</p>
      <p>Detective Superintendent Sean Healy is the first member of An Garda Síochána to be presented with the award from the Maritime Analysis Operations Centre for Narcotics (MAOC-N). Det Supt Healy received the award in Lisbon, where the law enforcement agency is based.</p>
      <p>A similar award was also presented at the same ceremony to two Irish Customs officers, Andrew Ryan and Michael Gilligan.</p>
      <p>Mr Ryan is a member of the Customs Maritime Unit based in Kinsale, Co Cork and Mr Gilligan is a senior customs official involved in drug enforcement.</p>
      <p>The role of MAOC-N is to prevent illegal maritime drug trafficking into Europe. It comprises law enforcement and military personnel from seven European countries including Ireland.</p>
      <p>This year, the co-ordination of the interception of cocaine shipments from South America by MAOC-N resulted in seizures totaling €1.8 billion from transnational organised crime groups and led to the arrest of a significant number of persons on suspicion of drug trafficking offences.</p>
      <p>Each year, MAOC-N presents an award, in the form of a medal to individuals who have displayed extraordinary commitment to the fight against international drug trafficking.</p>
      <p>Det Supt Healy has been involved in the investigation of major drug importation cases into Ireland over the past 25 years.</p>
      <p>His commitment, drive and successful operational activity has been recognised at an international level and he is regarded as an expert on maritime law.</p>
      <p>He and the two Customs officer received the MAOC-N 'Medal for Distinction' from the director of MAOC-N, Michael O’Sullivan at a ceremony in Lisbon on Thursday night.</p>
      <p>The ceremony was attended by a number of law enforcement officers and dignitaries from the seven countries.</p>
      <p>MAOC-N previously presented a similar award to retired Naval Service Commander Eugene Ryan, who also helped coordinate several maritime drugs seizures.</p>
