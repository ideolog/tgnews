      <p>A children's football coach who <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/police-scotland">mowed down a police officer</a> in his powerful Range Rover has walked free from court.</p>
      <p>Stephen Gibson sent PC Martin Foye hurtling through the air in October last year.</p>
      <p>Glasgow Sheriff Court heard the 31 year-old had gone to his estranged wife's home amid claims he was struggling with the break-up.</p>
      <p>PC Foye luckily escaped any serious injury following the hit and run in Cambuslang, near the city.</p>
      <p>Gibson - who coaches youngsters for Giffnock North - could have faced jail today having admitted to a charge of dangerous driving.</p>

      <p>But, Sheriff Andrew Cubie instead ordered him to do 250 hours of unpaid work and banned him from the road for two years.</p>
      <p>He told Gibson: "This was a serious offence as the circumstances involves injury to a police officer and damage to cars.</p>
      <p>“Why you went to your wife in the early hours of the morning is beyond me.</p>
      <p>“It was unwelcome and she phoned the police. She did not play a part in this.</p>
      <p>“You panicked and your actions were criminal.”</p>

      <p>Gibson, of Rutherglen, near Glasgow, was also hit with a six month restriction of liberty order.</p>
      <p>A previous hearing was told how PC Foye and a colleague tried to stop Gibson after he smacked his 4x4 into another car.</p>
      <p>But, Gibson yelled at the officers: "I am not stopping. I am going for it."</p>
      <p>His lawyer today said Gibson had argued with his estranged wife before leaving her home.</p>
      <p>Billy Lavelle, defending, added: “He was struggling with the situation as they were together for 10 years. It was his first relationship.</p>
      <p>“He left in his car but thought he would be arrested when the police arrived.</p>
      <p>“He wishes to apologise to the police officer.”</p>
      <p>Gibson had initially gone to trial last month before prosecutors accepted his guilty plea.</p>
