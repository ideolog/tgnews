      <p>Lakshadweep islanders heaved a sigh of relief on Friday as the cyclonic storm 'Maha' spared the archipelago and moved across without touching land.</p>
      <p>Lakshadweep MP Mohammed Faizal said the islands witnessed rough seas and heavy rains due to <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/cyclone">Cyclone </a>Maha but no major damage was reported.</p>
      <p>Some coconut trees were uprooted and a few houses and boats were damaged, but no major destruction had been reported, Faizal told PTI over phone.</p>
      <p>The Met department had earllier forecast that Maha will cross the Lakshadweep and gale wind speed reaching 80-90 kmph gusting to 100 kmph was likely over northern parts of the islands area and adjoining southeast Arabian sea.</p>
      <p>After moving across Lakshadweep, the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/cyclone">cyclone </a>lay centered on Friday morning about 450 km northnorthwest of Aminidivi (Lakshadweep), it said.</p>
      <p>The Kerala Disaster Management Authority said <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/cyclone">cyclone </a>Maha was not a threat to Kerala anymore.</p>
      <p>According to its weather update, the cyclonic system is currently moving in North West direction at a speed of 24 km per hour.</p>
      <p>However, the warning given to fishermen against venturing into the sea still stood, the authority said adding all other rain related alerts have been withdrawn.</p>
      <p>There was respite from rains in Kerala on Friday a day after several parts were battered by torrential showers with over 1,000 people being shifted to relief camps across the state.</p>
      <p>A Defence spokesman here said the Navy had taken all precautionary measures to deal with any eventuality due to the cyclone.</p>
      <p>The Navy on Thursday had directed the Naval officer-in-charge (NOIC) Lakshadweep &amp; Minicoy (L&amp;M) and INS Dweeprakshak at Kavaratti to take all precautions in co-ordination with the Union Territory of Lakshadweep (UTL) administration to ensure safety of men and material.</p>
      <p>Cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba had reviewed the preparedness of the island administration through video conference on Wednesday.</p>
