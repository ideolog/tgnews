      <p>Fisker will unveil the Ocean electric SUV on January 4, 2020; it will rival the Tesla Model Y.</p>
      <p>American start-up Fisker has revealed that its upcoming electric SUV will be called 'Ocean' and it will be unveiled in production-ready guise on January 4, 2020.</p>
      <p>The company claims to have designed the world’s most sustainable vehicle, with recycled, vegan and other natural products used throughout.</p>
      <p>Preview images show that the <a href="https://www.autocarindia.com/car-news/2020-tesla-model-y-revealed-411955"><b>Tesla Model Y</b></a> rival rides high and has modern, utilitarian styling. Flared arches hint at its performance potential, while the narrow headlights and chrome detailing are a nod to the Fisker Emotion concept seen last year.</p>
      <p>The Ocean e-SUV sports what Fisker calls “captivating design touches that have been traditionally reserved for supercars in the past”.</p>
      <p>Prominent styling details include a front-mounted radar in place of a grille, a large front air intake, flared wheel arches and a futuristic headlight design.</p>
      <p>The Ocean also features a Targa-style removable roof section with an inbuilt solar panel that boosts the capacity of the car's 80kWh lithium-ion battery pack. Fisker states, “With the touch of a button, an extended open-air atmosphere will be made possible without compromising the rugged and safe structural integrity of an SUV.”</p>
      <p>The battery is claimed to provide a range of up to 480km. The Ocean will be available in four-wheel-drive form, with an electric motor on each axle.</p>
      <p>Fisker also claims that the SUV's interior will offer class-leading space, a large head-up display and an intelligent user interface.</p>
      <p>In addition to this, the company is also working on a solid-state battery technology, which it says will allow future vehicles to gain 805km worth of charge in as little as one minute.</p>
      <p>The company’s American-Danish founder, Henrik Fisker, recently confirmed that the production model will only be available via a 'flexible lease' plan internationally, with no long-term contract necessary. It has now emerged that this scheme will operate through a bespoke smartphone app that will allow owners to book servicing and maintenance visits as well.</p>
      <p>Final specification and performance details of the Ocean SUV will be detailed when order books open on November 27, 2019, with full-scale production to get underway by late 2021. It's not confirmed where the Ocean will be produced, but Fisker says prototype testing will begin before the end of this year.</p>
      <p>Fisker Inc. was formed in 2016, succeeding the bankrupted Fisker Automotive that launched the Karma range-extender electric luxury sedan – now re-engineered and on sale as the Karma Revero – in 2011.</p>
