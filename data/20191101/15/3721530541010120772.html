      <p>There was a time, before the rise of social media and share buttons, when you could screw up in a game without having to worry that someone might post your blunder online — or worse, that it might go viral. You could mess up, feel embarrassed, and then move on with your life. Nobody would have to know.</p>
      <p>Now, though? Even the video games you play might haunt you with your embarrassments.</p>
      <p><i>Fortnite</i> Chapter 2’s big thing is that introduces <a href="https://www.polygon.com/fortnite/2019/10/15/20914523/fortnite-chapter-2-change-list-patch-notes">new mechanics, such as swimming</a>. For a while, everyone was starting off on the same foot, so to speak, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/fortnite/2019/10/22/20927051/fortnite-chapter-2-no-patch-notes-xp-changes-patch-v11-01">without much knowledge of how things worked</a> or how to best play a new game with a new map. So, inevitably, some people died in silly ways as they started to figure out what made Chapter 2 tick.</p>
      <p>One clip of a player diving out of a waterfall went viral earlier in the year, and Epic Games decided to commemorate the funny moment with an in-game memorial that marks exactly where they died:</p>

      </figure>
      <p>It’s not the first time Epic has done something like this. Infamously, a failed rescue attempt off a cliff also got <a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteBR/status/1190276746911858690">a tombstone last year that players could visit</a>. It seems that if your death makes people laugh, there’s a good chance it might get a nod in-game.</p>
      <p>It’s all in good fun, of course, but truthfully, now I’m going to start living in fear that my mistakes will be marked for everyone to see. Please, Epic, ignore my <i>Fortnite</i> escapades. Nobody needs to see or know about that!</p>
