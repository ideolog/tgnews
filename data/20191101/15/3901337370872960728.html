      <h1>Reader’s Voice: Watch Out Pirates, Its Payback Time!</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T15:45:00+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 15:45</time> by <a rel="author">SL Social</a></address>
      <p>It has been five years since Kaizer Chiefs last tasted victory in a match against Orlando Pirates and for that reason, Amakhosi fans feel that it is payback time against their eternal rivals.</p>
      <p>Ernst Middendorp’s team have been in sublime form this season, managing to pull off some stunning victories. Most notably when they swept aside Mamelodi Sundowns twice in a matter of weeks.</p>
      <p>This form has led to SL Supporter @Flipping lyf feeling that now is the time to set things straight against the Buccaneers.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“</i>
        <i>It’s payback time! The Khosi nation are going to reclaim our bragging against Pirates in style. Back to back wins with the margin of 3-1 and 2-0, watch the space.”</i>

      <p>SL Supporter @Butholakhe Sthole echoes these sentiments and feel that Chiefs were able to overcome a tougher opponent in the form of Sundowns and therefore should make light work of Rhulani Mokwena’s side.</p>
      <p> “<i>Guys please give Pirates a free lesson on Saturday; you surprised Pitso’s side who are a stronger team than Pirates, so you cannot lose to a struggling club! Rise Khosi Rise good luck.”</i></p>
      <p> Meanwhile, SL Supporter @Honestkhosi feels that the stakes are so high that it could end up costing Mokwena his job, if he fails to beat the men from Naturena.</p>
      <p> <i>“The only way Rhulani can keep his job is to beat Kaizer Chiefs. That's why he attended Kaizer Chiefs vs Sundowns match with a pen and a paper. So that he can write every detail about Kaizer Chiefs and make a proper plan.”</i></p>
      <p> </p>

        <b>Do you think the Amakhosi steam train can roll over Pirates this time around?</b>
