      <p>The West Coast isn’t getting any love from this New York <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/real-estate">landlord</a>.</p>
      <p>A woman shared a tweet from her <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel/vacation-destinations/new-york-city">New York City</a> landlord warning her about moving to California, which he described as “the gates of hell,” in reference to the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/disasters/fires">multiple fires</a> currently ablaze in the Golden State.</p>

      <p>“Glad to hear you are getting a good opportunity,” the text begins. “Please write something watchable for TV. Except for a handful of shows it’s total garbage.”</p>
      <p>Then, his tone shifts, and the landlord informs his soon-to-be former tenant that “half of Calif. Is burned up and the other half is ready to go.”</p>
