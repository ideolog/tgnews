      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/LiverpoolFC">Liverpool FC</a> manager <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Jurgen_Klopp">Jurgen Klopp</a> admits he has a selection dilemma over key midfielder <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/fabinho">Fabinho</a>.</p>
      <p>The Brazil international is one booking away from a one-match ban so if he was to be yellow-carded at <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/AstonVilla">Aston Villa</a> on Saturday he would miss the crunch clash with title rivals <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/ManchesterCity">Manchester City</a> at Anfield on November 10.</p>
      <p>Fabinho has established himself as Klopp's first-choice midfielder and has started all-but-one of Liverpool's 13 <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/english-premier-league">Premier League</a> and Champions League matches.</p>
      <p>He has yet to lose any of the 30 league games he has started since arriving from Monaco for Â£43.7million in the summer of 2018 but Klopp has to consider whether to protect him at Villa Park.</p>
      <p>"I don't know yet. We have to see. I know it (the potential suspension), of course. What we do with that I don't know," he said.</p>
      <p>Asked what instructions he would give the player should he play the German joked: "No challenges at all!</p>
      <p>"That's not possible against Aston Villa, playing without challenges, especially in that position. You cannot ask for this.</p>
      <p>"The player knows it, I know it. Is there any game where you think that's a good game to get a fifth yellow card?</p>
      <p>"Maybe other teams are pretty smart in that and take them, I don't know, I never did it.</p>
      <p>"We have to deal with. Maybe he has to deal with it on the pitch or I have to deal with it with the line-up. We didn't make a final decision yet, so we will see."</p>
      <p>Klopp could be without midfielder <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/naby-keita">Naby Keita</a>, who came off with a knock in the midweek Carabao Cup win over Arsenal, but defender <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/joel-matip">Joel Matip</a> is definitely absent.</p>
      <p>The centre-back has missed the last three matches with the recurrence of a knee problem and is still some way from fitness.</p>
      <p>"Naby I don't know yet, we will see," added Klopp.</p>
      <p>"Joel is not available for the next few weeks.</p>
      <p>"What could that mean? A couple is two, right? So a few is more than three."</p>
