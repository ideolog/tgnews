      <p>HALIFAX -- The RCMP is urging parents to check their children’s Halloween candy after one parent in Nova Scotia’s Annapolis Valley reported finding cannabis edibles among their child’s treats.</p>
      <p>The incident was reported to police in Coldbrook around 9:30 p.m. Thursday.</p>
      <p>The parent told police their group was trick-or-treating in the areas of Cambridge, Kentville and Coldbrook. They aren’t certain which home the cannabis edibles came from.</p>
      <p>Police say there were eight children in the group, and all of their candy was checked by an adult, but only one child received the cannabis edibles.</p>
      <p>The package had a Halloween-themed label on the front and contained several jujube candies. A sticker on the back indicated the THC content of the candies, which police say alerted the parent.</p>
      <p>Police have seized the cannabis edibles.</p>
      <p>Police say the investigation into the incident is ongoing. They’re asking anyone with information about the incident, or who may have had a similar experience, to contact them.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, they’re urging parents and guardians to carefully inspect all Halloween candy for possible cannabis edibles or tampered treats.</p>
