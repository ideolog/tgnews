      <p><a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/fallout-76/40362"><i>Fallout 76</i></a><i> </i>buyers in Australia are entitled to a refund, under a ruling from that country’s Competition and Consumer Commission <a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/media-release/zenimax-to-refund-consumers-for-the-fallout-76-game">published earlier today</a>. In a statement, the ACCC said that ZeniMax Media, the parent company of Fallout maker Bethesda Softworks, “accepted that their actions were likely to have contravened the Australian Consumer Law.”</p>
      <p>Consumers who bought <i>Fallout</i><i> 76 </i>from its Nov. 24, 2018 launch until June 1, 2019 can request the refund. If they accept a refund, they will no longer be able to access and play the game. <i>Fallout 76 </i>is an always-online multiplayer game that requires a check-in to Bethesda Softworks’ servers on startup.</p>
      <p>The ACCC’s statement listed “problems with the servers, lagging, graphic and visual problems” as faults within <i>Fallout 76 </i>that were significant enough to warrant a refund. ZeniMax, according to the committee, acknowledged that its customer service representatives “are likely to have misled certain Australian consumers about their rights to a refund when they experienced faults with their <i>Fallout 76</i> game.”</p>
      <p>“When a consumer has purchased a product that has a fault which amounts to a major failure, the Australian Consumer Law provides them with the right to ask for their choice of either a repair, replacement or refund,” the commission said.</p>
      <p>Rights to a refund vary by jurisdiction and in the United States, consumer recourse typically comes through a seller’s policies. The <a href="https://www.polygon.com/xbox">Xbox</a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/ps4">PlayStation 4</a> marketplaces do not offer returns for online purchases. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/steam">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/1/11/18179100/epic-games-store-refund-policy-steam-pc">the Epic Games Store</a> have policies where buyers can get their money back, no questions asked, if they demand a refund within two weeks of purchase and with less than two hours of gameplay time in the title. Earlier this year, Activision <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/2/9/18218249/guitar-hero-live-refunds-class-action-lawsuit-money-back-guitar-hero-tv-taken-down">agreed to a settlement</a> refunding buyers of <i>Guitar Hero Live</i><i> </i>after the company turned off its streaming music library, effectively gutting the game.</p>
      <p>Polygon has reached out to a Bethesda Softworks representative for additional comment.</p>

      <p><i>Fallout 76</i> had <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/2/7/18214008/fallout-76-updates-patch-fix-future">several technical problems following its launch</a> which included a game-breaking, item-duping exploit that allowed players to replicate high-value weapons, gear, and the like, threatening the in-game economy. Though <i>Fallout 76</i>’s post-launch support has added several new features and largely resolved its technical faults, players still have much to criticize about the franchise’s attempt at a multiplayer game.</p>
      <p>Bethesda Softworks recently announced an in-game subscription for <i>Fallout 76 </i>that delivers private servers, newly created instances, and other content to those paying $12.99 per month. Players said last week that key features of “Fallout 1st” <a href="https://www.polygon.com/fallout/2019/10/24/20930729/fallout-1st-private-servers-glitches-bugs-problems-scrap-box-pc-ps4-xbox-one">weren’t working as advertised, though</a>.</p>
      <p>The ACCC’s statement said that ZeniMax/Bethesda “has also undertaken to amend its customer service documents and scripts to address the ACCC’s concerns about misrepresentation of consumer guarantee rights under the [Australian Consumer Law].”</p>
