      <p>Shenzhen - <b>Karolina Pliskova</b> overcame a mid-match stutter to book a semi-final showdown with world No 1 Ashleigh Barty after a three-set victory over Simona Halep at the WTA Finals on Friday.</p>
      <p>The world No 2 lost six straight games in the second and third sets but eventually prevailed 6-0, 2-6, 6-4 in one hour and 43 minutes to secure the Purple Group's second spot. </p>
      <p>Defending champion <b>Elina Svitolina</b> will play Belinda Bencic in the other semi-final after she capped off an unbeaten round robin campaign with a 7-5, 7-6 (12/10) victory over late replacement Sofia Kenin.</p>
      <p>Pliskova believed she would be the underdog against Barty. "She's having a great year, so it's going to be super tough," she said. </p>
      <p>"It's going to be a big challenge but I have nothing to lose."</p>
      <p>An aggressive Pliskova started red hot against Halep winning 13 of the first 16 points en route to blitzing through the first set in just 20 minutes.</p>
      <p>Halep appeared rejuvenated after receiving a pep talk from coach Darren Cahill between sets as the match flipped.</p>
      <p>The Wimbledon champion finally hit the scoreboard by breaking to open the second set and she rediscovered her touch, hitting menacing slices to rattle Pliskova.</p>
      <p>Halep broke Pliskova's suddenly tentative serve three times to force a decider and her momentum continued in the third set to jump out to a 2-0 lead.</p>
      <p>The twists continued with Pliskova regaining control but she was unable to serve it out in the ninth game.</p>
      <p>Halep's late rally was short-lived as Pliskova booked her third straight semi-finals appearance at the WTA Finals.</p>
      <p>In the earlier match, Svitolina was pushed in the dead-rubber by world No 12 Kenin, who replaced Bianca Andreescu after the US Open champion suffered a knee injury against Pliskova on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Kenin was the second replacement used at the tournament after Kiki Bertens stepped in for world number three Naomi Osaka, who withdrew due to a shoulder injury.</p>
      <p>Svitolina was relieved the match didn't go the distance ahead of Saturday's semi-final against Bencic. </p>
      <p>"For me the main thing is to recover first, to be fresh physically and mentally," she said.</p>
      <p>"We know the game style that she (Bencic) has. She takes the ball quite early and I have to be ready for this," she added.</p>
      <p>Kenin was impressive from the start, moving Svitolina around the court with precise shots but was unable to serve out the first set in the 10th game.</p>
      <p>Svitolina made her pay and broke again in the 12th game to draw first blood.</p>
      <p>Kenin rued a double fault on set point in the 10th game and was shortly after broken by Svitolina, who won her eighth straight WTA Finals match in a thrilling tiebreak.</p>
      <p>The 25-year-old is hoping to end a barren season on a high having not captured a title since last year's triumph in Singapore.</p>
      <p>Kenin, an American rising star, enjoyed her first taste of the lucrative season-ender. "Hopefully next year I can come back here," the 20-year-old said.</p>
