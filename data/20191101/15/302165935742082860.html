      <p>WASHINGTON, Nov 1 — President Donald Trump said today that the United States knows who the Islamic State group’s new leader is, after the death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in a US-led commando raid.</p>
      <p>“ISIS has a new leader. We know exactly who he is!” Trump tweeted. US officials did not give any more details.</p>
      <p>Islamic State earlier confirmed the death of its leader al-Baghdadi in a statement and named his replacement as Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Quraishi.</p>
      <p>However, little is known about Hashimi, whose name was seldom mentioned as a possible successor the multiple times that Baghdadi was falsely reported killed in recent years.</p>
      <p>Baghdadi, who led IS since 2014 and was the world’s most wanted man, died in a US special forces raid in Syria’s northwestern province of Idlib on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Islamic State also confirmed the killing in another raid the following day of the group’s previous spokesman, Abu Hassan al-Muhajir.</p>
      <p>The statement said the jihadist group’s legislative and consultative body convened after the 48-year-old Iraqi-born jihadist chief’s death and “agreed” on a replacement. — AFP</p>
