      <h1>Steve Scalise: In the Soviet Union They Have a 'Behind Closed Doors Secret Impeachment Process' | Breitbart</h1>

      <p>House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA) commented Friday on the impeachment inquiry and his <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/10/31/watch-steve-scalise-impeachment-resolution-contains-soviet-style-rules/">remarks</a> from the day before likening the House Democrats’ process to how it would work in the Soviet Union.</p>
      <p>Scalise said the United States deserves better than a “one-sided” and “behind closed doors secret impeachment process,” adding the Democrats’ impeachment resolution is not fair because it will allow for House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) to continue operating in secret.</p>
      <p>“I equate it to Soviet-style justice because maybe in the Soviet Union they have a one-sided, closed doors, behind closed doors secret impeachment process,’ Scalise told “Fox and Friends.” “This is the United States of America. We deserve better than this. Our justice system works a lot different than this.”</p>
