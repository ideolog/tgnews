      <h1>Malaysia backs call for dedicated Asean team to help displaced Rohingya return home</h1>

      <p>BANGKOK, Nov 1 ― Foreign Minister Datuk Saifuddin Abdullah expressed tonight Malaysia’s support for a “full-time, dedicated team” to implement the repatriation of the Rohingya people who have been displaced from their home in Myanmar’s conflict-riddled Rakhine state.</p>
      <p>The proposal to establish such a team was made by Asean secretary-general Lim Jock Hoi.</p>
      <p>“The full-time group should enlist volunteers from civil society organisations (CSOs) working on the process,” according to a statement posted on Abdullah’s personal Facebook page tonight.</p>
      <p>“In this regard, Asean should facilitate a process of meaningful dialogue between Myanmar and Rohingya refugees in Cox Bazar, Bangladesh in order to build a foundation of trust needed for the facilitation of voluntary repatriation,” it added.</p>
      <p>Saifuddin had earlier attended a working dinner for Asean foreign ministers ahead of the 35th Asean Summit hosted by Thailand here, which kicks off tomorrow.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad flew in earlier this afternoon and will be leading the Malaysian delegation for the summit which has as its theme “advancing partnership for sustainability”.</p>
      <p>The mass exodus of the Muslim Rohingya people from their home in Myanmar the last two years where they have been denied citizenship has been a problem for the regional bloc that has a strong non-interference policy.</p>
      <p>Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya have flooded into neighbouring countries alleging rape and killing by Myanmar military in an ethnic cleansing campaign, resulting in a humanitarian crisis.</p>
      <p>Malaysia, which has sheltered an estimated 95,000 Rohingya, has been a vocal advocate of justice and citizenship for the refugees.</p>
