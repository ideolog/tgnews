      <h1>Jeff Goldblum confirms when Jurassic World 3 begins filming Laura Dern, Sam Neill returns</h1>
      <h2>Jurassic World 3 will see Goldblum return alongside Laura Dern and Sam Neill</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T15:42:17+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 15:42</time> by <a rel="author">Lewis Knight, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/lewis-knight/</a></address>
      <p>Jurassic World 3 star Jeff Goldblum has confirmed when the much-anticipated sequel will begin filming.</p>
      <p>The upcoming follow-up to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jurassic-world">Jurassic World</a> : Fallen Kingdom has <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/film/jurassic-world-3-feature-laura-20171568">already been confirmed</a> to see Goldblum reprise his iconic role as Dr Ian Malcolm opposite <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/sam-neill">Sam Neill</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/laura-dern">Laura Dern</a> as Dr Alan Grant and Dr Ellie Sattler, respectively.</p>
      <p>Appearing on Chris Evans' Virgin Radio Show today (November 1), <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jeff-goldblum">Jeff Goldblum</a> discussed scary films with the radio and let slip when the film begins filming and where.</p>
      <p>Goldblum said: "Well, I guess those dinosaur movies are kind of scary. And we're gonna do another one of those around these parts come this summer."</p>
      <p>So he'll be filming in the UK and he also added who with.</p>

      <p>He added: "[I'll] be here shooting with Laura Dern and Sam O'Neill and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chris-pratt">Chris Pratt</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/bryce-dallas-howard">Bryce Dallas Howard</a> . Colin Trevorrow as the great director is going to be writing and directing it. And I can't wait."</p>
      <p>The film will likely continue from the cliffhanger ending of Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, which saw dinosaurs escape into the streets of California after being held in a facility by a nefarious corperation.</p>
      <p>But how will the original cast of Jurassic Park factor into the story of Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard's characters, Owen and Claire?</p>
      <p>Here's hoping we have more details soon!</p>
