      <p><b>CINCINNATIÂ (AP)</b> - Authorities say two Ohio families who went trick-or-treating together have reported finding sharp metal objects in Halloween candy.</p>
      <p>Police in Colerain Township outside Cincinnati say a father from one family found an object Thursday night in a peanut butter cup. A mother from the other family needed several stitches when she cut her finger while spreading out candy.</p>
      <p>Colerain Township police spokesman Sgt. Scott Owen says the objects likely would have come from the same house in a five-block-area where the families trick-or-treated. Police will try to collect DNA from the objects while determining whether the reports are genuine.</p>
      <p>Colerain Township tweeted early Friday that parents should check their children's candy and set aside anything that appears to have been torn or tampered with.</p>
