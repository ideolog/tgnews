      <h1>Google Fi SIM cards are now available at Target</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T15:17:19+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 15:17</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5google.com/author/technacity/" target="_blank">Abner Li</a></address>
      <p>Last week, Google Fi announced that it would be taking advantage of <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/10/22/google-fi-dual-connect/">DSDS starting</a> on the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL. In addition to the eSIM, a SIM is required and Google today is making Fi SIM cards <a href="https://www.target.com/p/google-fi-sim-card-kit/-/A-78308412?ref=tgt_adv_XS000000&amp;AFID=google_pla_df&amp;fndsrc=tgtao&amp;CPNG=PLA_Electronics%2BShopping_Brand&amp;adgroup=SC_Electronics&amp;LID=700000001170770pgs&amp;network=g&amp;device=c&amp;location=1014221&amp;ds_rl=1246978&amp;ds_rl=1248099&amp;ds_rl=1246978">available at Target</a>.</p>
      <p>Joining <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/02/11/google-fi-best-buy/">Best Buy</a> earlier this year, new and current subscribers can walk into Target stores nationwide to get a “Google Fi SIM Card Kit.” It costs $9.99 — instead of free from Google directly — but it includes a $10 credit that will be applied on your first bill. These are not the data-only variants, providing both cellular and data connectivity.</p>
      <p>The retail packaging is quite simple with the latest logo, Project-less name, and tagline: “A different kind of phone plan.” Target joins Best Buy stocking these kits back in February. It’s faster than having to wait a few days for free shipping from Fi if your device doesn’t support eSIM.</p>
      <p>In September, Google announced a new “<a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/09/17/google-fi-unlimited-plan/">Unlimited” plan</a>, which the Target listing makes reference to. Starting at $70, you get unlimited data but capped video. The original “Flexible” plan where you pay by the GB is still available.</p>
