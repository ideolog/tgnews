      <p><b>SPOOKY NIGHT:</b> The London Edition threw a lavish deep-sea theme Halloween dinner <a href="https://wwd.com/tag/party/">party</a> on Thursday in partnership with Project 0 in order to raise awareness around ocean conservation, hosted by Georgia May Jagger, Rufus Taylor and Kim Jones, who unfortunately couldn’t attend due to scheduling conflict.</p>
      <p>Poppy Delevingne, Nick Grimshaw, Pixie Geldof, Jaime Winstone and Clara Paget attended the <a href="https://wwd.com/eye/parties/heidi-klum-halloween-party-2019-celebrity-photos-1203360719/">party</a> at Berners Tavern, which was transformed for the night into a fictional sunken dining room of the ill-fated HMS Berners, once the most glamorous ship to sail. Grimshaw dressed as a giant blue water jellyfish, while Paget cos-played Anne Bonny, one of the most famous female pirates of all time.</p>
      <p>Guests were greeted by a cast of fantastical creatures, mermaids, deep-sea divers and freakishly flexible disco-fishes, some with luminescent hula hoops, upon arrival with drinks made of Grey Goose Vodka. During the evening, one could purchase “pearls,” 50 pounds each, to be in with a chance to win lost treasures from the ship’s treasure chest, guarded by a mermaid and a fortune-telling lobster lady.</p>
      <p>Prizes included an overnight stay at The London Edition, Glastonbury tickets, Dior Saddle bag, Diptyque candles, Shrimps hair clips and Flowers voucher.</p>
      <p>The event also acted as a fund-raiser for Project 0, a global movement supported by leaders in the fields of science, business, culture, fashion to awaken the fight for the ocean. A third of ticket sales went directly to Project 0.</p>
