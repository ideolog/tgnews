      <p>A juror has been discharged in the retrial of Hillsborough match commander David Duckenfield.</p>
      <p>The 75-year-old is standing trial at Preston Crown Court accused of the gross negligence manslaughter of 95 Liverpool fans at the FA Cup semi-final on April 15 1989.</p>
      <p>The male juror was discharged from the jury on Friday.</p>
      <p>Court was adjourned until Tuesday, when the trial will continue.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Ninety-six men, women and children died following the crush on the Leppings Lane terrace at the match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.</p>
      <p>Under the law at the time there can be no prosecution for the death of the 96th victim, Anthony Bland, as he died more than a year and a day after his injuries were caused.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Duckenfield, a retired South Yorkshire Police officer, stood trial in January but the jury was unable to return any verdict and was discharged.</p>
