      <h1>Google parent Alphabet agrees £1.6bn Fitbit deal</h1>

      <p>Fitbit is being acquired by Google’s parent company for about 2.1 billion dollars (£1.6 billion).</p>
      <p>The deal enables the internet company to step back into the hotly contested market for smartwatches and health and fitness trackers.</p>
      <p>A pioneer in wearable technology, Fibit’s market capitalisation soared to just under 10 billion dollars after becoming a public company in 2015 but its value this week is well below two billion dollars.</p>
      <p>Google has struggled to stake out a presence in the wearables market – its earlier foray into smartwatches that used its Android Wear software has largely faded.</p>
      <blockquote>If you look at what Apple has done with wearables, it is a missing piece of the puzzle for Google<cite>Daniel Ives, Wedbush Securities</cite></blockquote>
      <p>This deal could give it more of an opportunity to compete with the Apple Watch.</p>
      <p>“Google doesn’t want to be left out of the party,” said analyst Daniel Ives, of Wedbush Securities.</p>
      <p>“If you look at what Apple has done with wearables, it is a missing piece of the puzzle for Google.”</p>
      <p>When rumours of a potential buyout by Google surfaced earlier this week, Fitbit shares soared almost 30%.</p>
      <p>The stock jumped another 17% at the opening bell on Friday.</p>
      <p>Alphabet said it will pay 7.35 dollars per share for the company, which were trading at 7.20 dollars each after the deal was announced.</p>
      <p>“With Google’s resources and global platform, Fitbit will be able to accelerate innovation in the wearables category, scale faster, and make health even more accessible to everyone,” Fitbit co-founder and chief executive James Park said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Fitbit has 28 million active users worldwide and has sold more than 100 million devices.</p>
      <p>The company said that its privacy and security guidelines will not change and that it will continue to be transparent about the data it collects and why.</p>

      <p>Fitbit said it never sells personal information and that its health and wellness data will not be used for the advertisements that drive Google’s main business.</p>
      <p>Fitbit’s privacy policy says data it collects include a user’s date of birth, gender, height, weight, and for some users it also stores logs tracking their food and water intake, as well as sleep and female health patterns.</p>
      <p>The deal is expected to close next year if approved by regulators and Fitbit shareholders.</p>
      <p>Mr Ives said it is likely to face additional scrutiny at a time when federal antitrust enforcers and Congress have launched broad investigations into the market dominance of Google and other major tech companies.</p>
      <p>“This is definitely going to get a very close look from regulators,” he said.</p>
