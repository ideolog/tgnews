      <p>The kind of rubbish thing about becoming obsessed with a band at a young age is the passing of time. Sadly, although their music may not, their union often has a time limit. But you know what is the absolute best? Reunion tours. And news that My Chemical Romance is reuniting for one night has got people thinking: <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/how-to-get-tickets-to-my-chemical-romances-reunion-show-relive-their-hits-19287921">will My Chemical Romance tour the UK in 2020?</a></p>
      <p>I am so ready to rejoin the Black Parade. Pass me the straighteners and some black hair dye IMMEDIATELY.</p>
      <p>The band revealed the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4SyPJKBvAr/">exciting reunion news via their social media</a> accounts on Halloween (because, obviously), letting fans know that they are to reform for a show in L.A. on Dec. 20 this year. As well as that, the subsequently revealed that they are to <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/the-news/my-chemical-romance-are-headlining-download-festival-japan/">headline the Download festivals in Australia, New Zealand, and Japan.</a></p>
      <p>I contacted their press team to enquire about any potential UK tour and I'll let you know as soon as I've heard anything back.</p>
      <p>I am an optimist and I hope that these shows, their first together since 2012, are a sign of goth things to come. I mean great things to come.</p>
      <p>Like, come on, they can't be pulling out the black blazers for one show only right? Especially since it's been a stonking <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/my-chemical-romance-reunion-tour-announcement-rumours-2019-2020-2563164">six years since the band split</a>, according to <i>NME.</i></p>

      <p>When they broke up (stop it, you're crying), front man Gerard Way wrote one of the saddest (and long) letters you'll ever read.<a href="http://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1rjdh4f"> One which he signed off with:</a></p>
      <blockquote>"My Chemical Romance is done. But it can never die. It is alive in me, in the guys, and it is alive inside all of you. I always knew that, and I think you did too.Because it is not a band — it is an idea."</blockquote>
      <p>Way's writing prowess isn't solely for writing super wordy letters but also for being the mind behind the enormously successful graphic novels <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/the-umbrella-academy-season-2-renewal-might-answer-important-cliffhanger-from-the-season-1-finale-17003787">on which Netflix show <i>The Umbrella Academy</i></a> is based on.</p>
      <p>He spoke to <i>NME</i>, explaining that the team work, love, and respect between the members of the <i>Umbrella Academy</i> was <a href="https://www.nme.com/music-interviews/gerard-way-interview-umbrella-academy-2454280">definitely inspired by his time in the band</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>"I can see the guys from the band in each of the characters. And people I met on the road too. And there's a lot of stuff in there about fame as well. A lot of that was my way of processing the experience My Chemical Romance had if I'm being totally honest."</blockquote>
      <p>All fingers, toes, and black eyeliner pencils crossed for more news from the boys.</p>
