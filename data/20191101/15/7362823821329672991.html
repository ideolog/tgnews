      <p>Did Jimmy G throw up a Hail Mary?</p>
      <p>The Internet did what the Internet does after <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/san-francisco-49ers">San Francisco 49ers’</a> quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo appeared to make a pass at veteran sideline reporter Erin Andrews following Thursday night’s game.</p>
      <p>Garoppolo threw four touchdown passes to help lead his team to a 28-25 victory over the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/arizona-cardinals">Arizona Cardinals</a>, officially marking the halfway point in their undefeated season.</p>

      <p>But on Friday morning, it wasn’t the game that fans were talking about but rather the cringeworthy exchange that followed between the 27-year-old star quarterback and the Fox sideline reporter.</p>
      <p>Andrews interviewed Garoppolo on the field, asking him how it felt to keep the winning streak going.</p>
      <p>He answered: “It feels great, baby. Happy Halloween.”</p>

      <p>Andrews appeared to grimace somewhat and, while laughing off the odd remark, replies “Happy Halloween right back at you, thank you so much.”</p>
      <p>Garoppolo walks away and turns back to wave, saying “see you.” To compound matters, he then awkwardly stumbled into Arizona Cardinal running back Alfred Morris.</p>
      <p>Twitter erupted with memes about “Jimmy GQ” “shooting his shot.”</p>
