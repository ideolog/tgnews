      <p>The 32-year-old was instrumental in FC Barcelona's 5-1 home win over Real Valladolid, scoring twice and assisting two further strikes.</p>
      <p>One of Messi's goals came via a brilliantly taken free-kick, one that had many, including his own colleagues, in disbelief. After the game, Vidal was quick to praise his captain, saying he continues to surprise his own teammates day in and day out.</p>

      <p>"It makes a difference with Leo giving all his quality. When he's like this, the team feels it," the Chilean told <i>Movistar+.</i></p>
      <p>"We see him every day, but he surprises us every day. Leo is from another planet.</p>
      <p>"We are happy, we won, and the team felt good. I have no words to talk about Leo. You have to take advantage of it and make the most of him."</p>
