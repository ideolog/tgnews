      <p>Chelsea boss Frank Lampard has dismissed suggestions defender Antonio Rudiger is ready to return from injury after the player declared himself fit.</p>
      <p>Centre-back Rudiger has endured an injury-plagued start to the season and managed just one appearance under Lampard.</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old Germany international, who had knee surgery during the summer before sustaining a pelvic problem, has been quoted as saying he was available to boost the Blues’ options ahead of Saturday’s game at Watford.</p>

      <p>But Lampard has contradicted that assessment and says Rudiger is scheduled to undergo further assessment early next week.</p>
      <p>“No, he’s not fit. I saw the quotes, whether there was a miscommunication somewhere, he’s not fit,” said Lampard.</p>
      <p>“He’s going to see a consultant on Monday because he has an ongoing issue in his pelvic area which is bothering him so I was a bit surprised by the quotes.</p>
      <p>“It’s a miscommunication, he’s not there.”</p>
      <p>Lampard, who saw his side’s seven-match winning run ended by Manchester United in the Carabao Cup in midweek, also remains without N’Golo Kante.</p>
      <blockquote>Ever since we've been on the winning run - which obviously ended in midweek - the game became more dangerous because of the idea of any over-confidence, which I work against</blockquote>
      <p>France midfielder Kante has not featured since before the last international break because of a groin issue but is closing in on a return.</p>
      <p>Lampard is keen to have the influential pair back in contention as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>“Every player in the squad that’s not available is disappointing but it comes with the territory, injuries are there,” said Lampard.</p>
      <p>“Himself (Rudiger) and N’Golo are obviously top players and carried over injuries from last season – different injuries now but it’s been a domino effect.</p>
      <p>“The players will be more frustrated than anyone else because there’s nothing worse than being a player when you can’t have input into what the team is doing every week, disappointing for me because I want to be able to select from them.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>“We’ll keep going and as soon as both of them are fit – N’Golo’s close, he’s working with the team now – we’ll be all the better for that.”</p>
      <p>Chelsea sit fourth in the table from following successive top-flight wins.</p>
      <p>A trip to face the winless Hornets at Vicarage Road represents an ideal opportunity to extend that impressive streak.</p>
      <p>However, Lampard is wary of his players becoming complacent against struggling opposition.</p>
      <p>“Ever since we’ve been on the winning run – which obviously ended in midweek – the game became more dangerous because of the idea of any over-confidence, which I work against,” said Lampard.</p>

      <p>“We saw what they did last year, getting big results and regularly being a very strong team and making the FA Cup final.</p>
      <p>“We cannot underestimate the team that will be hurting because they haven’t won for a while and will have every ambition to try and win this game, so I certainly have even more focus on what we need to do.”</p>
      <p>Midfielder Ross Barkley remains sidelined by an ankle injury but centre-back Andreas Christensen is closing in on a return following a hamstring problem.</p>
