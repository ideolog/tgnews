      <p>INDIO, Cali. – Rage Against the Machine is reuniting after a nine-year hiatus.</p>
      <p>Industry sources confirmed the news to both <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/rage-against-the-machine-reunion-coachella-907070/">Rolling Stone</a> and <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/8542057/rage-against-the-machine-reuniting-2020-coachella">Billboard</a> on Friday.</p>
      <p>Rolling Stone reports that the American rock band will embark on a brief three show warm-up tour in the southwestern U.S. in March before headlining both weekends of the upcoming Coachella music festival in April.</p>
      <p>This won’t be the band’s first appearance at Coachella. They headlined the inaugural festival in 1999 and again played there in 2007.</p>
      <p>Speculation surrounding the band’s reunion started on Instagram, where an unverified account posted a list of tour dates with a photo that guitarist Tom Morello posted days earlier. The band has not confirmed the dates and locations in the post.</p>
