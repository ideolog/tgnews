      <h2>Job action Friday morning includes ditching uniforms, refusing overtime with plans to escalate</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T15:00:00+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 15:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.northdeltareporter.com/author/ashley-wadhwani/" target="_blank">Ashley Wadhwani</a></address>
      <p>Strike action is officially underway among Metro Vancouver bus drivers, SeaBus operators and maintenance workers following a break down in negotiations between the union representing 5,000 members and its employer.</p>
      <p>Starting Friday at 8 a.m., SeaBus and bus operators will replace their Coast Mountain Bus Company uniforms with regular attire. Technicians and maintenance workers will begin refusing overtime.</p>
      <p>The strike action comes after the Unifor announced that contract talks with Coast Mountain broke off Thursday afternoon. A 72-hour strike notice, supported by 99 per cent of Unifor local 111 and 2200 members, was issued earlier this week.</p>
      <p>“The system has normalized overtime, so without it, the turnaround for repairs and other maintenance will build up quickly,” Unifor Local 2200 president Mike Smith <a href="https://www.surreynowleader.com/news/transit-strike-would-target-uniforms-uniforms-for-maintenance-workers-union/">said Thursday</a>. “We trust that TransLink will not put unsafe vehicles back on the road, so it is a question of fewer vehicles available in the system.”</p>

      <p>In a last-ditch effort to halt job action Friday morning, Coast Mountain Bus Company president Mike McDaniel released a statement urging the union to come back to the bargaining table.</p>
      <p>“Our negotiators have repeatedly asked union representatives to participate in third-party mediation to help resolve the current situation, but they have refused to take part,” McDaniel said.</p>
      <p>Gavin McGarrigle, Unifor Western Regional Director, said that job action will escalate in the coming weeks.</p>
      <p>More to come.</p>
