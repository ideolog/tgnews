      <p>The singer revealed her weight loss when she attended <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/drake">Drake’s</a> birthday bash last week.</p>
      <p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/adele-march-2016-cover?verso=true">Vogue</a> in 2016, Adele spoke about her health regimen.</p>
      <p>“I was trying to get some stamina for my tour, so I lost a bit of weight. Now I fit into normal, off-the-shelf clothes — which is a really big problem for me!” she shared.</p>
