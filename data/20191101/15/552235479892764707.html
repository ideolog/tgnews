      <p>Ayr was added to many people’s must visit places as the town featured on a new property series last week.</p>
      <p>The town was the focal point on BBC’s Escape to the Perfect Town where celebrity host Nicki Chapman hopes to find house buyers their dream pad.</p>
      <p>The programme showcased not only stunning homes on Bellevue Lane, Racecourse View and in Doonfoot but showed off the beach, town centre, the Gaiety Theatre and the university.</p>
      <p>Former Pop Idol judge Nicki seemed fond of the town describing it as “a popular seaside resort and the birthplace of the country’s best known poet, Robert Burns”.</p>
      <p>She added: “It’s a town where the busy esplanade and beautiful beaches sit side by side with the Firth of Clyde.</p>

      <p>“Whether you’re travelling from near or far in Ayr, a warm welcome is a par for the course.</p>
      <p>“With a city [Glasgow] a train ride away and a short stroll from the sea, this certainly is an accessible yet atmospheric place to move to.”</p>
      <p>Nicki’s buyers, from New Malden, Surrey, had £400,000 in their pocket and pinpointed Ayr as a potential perfect town to live.</p>
      <p>They described the area as “cosmopolitan and buzzing”, adding that they loved the beach and were pleasantly surprised to find a theatre and university, both within walking distance of the town centre.</p>
      <p>Many TV viewers shared their adoration for the town online.</p>
      <p>Jennifer Robertson said: “A great advert for our town.”</p>

      <p>Beryl Crighton echoed Jennifer’s thoughts and said: “It’s time we were taking pride in our town.”</p>
      <p>Sylvia Lambe said: “I loved watching the programme and seeing Ayr made me proud to say I was born there.”</p>
      <p>Colin Stevens added: “I would move there tomorrow if I got the chance- my mother was born in Ayr.”</p>
      <p>The couple toured the area, soaked up the atmosphere and rich history and were keen on the location but not 100 percent on the properties they were shown.</p>
      <p>Nicki said: “Whilst we didn’t manage to quite find them their perfect property, Ayr certainly delivered in being their perfect town.”</p>
