      <p>A <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southwest/texas">Texas</a> woman’s workout triggered a rare but potentially deadly condition that required her to be hospitalized, according to a local report.</p>
      <p>Jennifer Slusher of Corpus Christi told <a href="https://www.kristv.com/news/local-news/workout-sends-local-woman-to-the-hospital">KRIS 6 News</a> that she noticed an unusual amount of soreness following a recent arm workout. A few days later, the soreness progressed, eventually causing extreme pain and swelling.</p>
      <p>“I started to have less flexibility in my arms [and] couldn’t straighten them out,” she told the news station.“I realized that something was really wrong,”</p>

      <p>Slusher went to a local emergency room where she learned she was suffering from rhabdomyolysis — a “rare condition in which muscle cells break down and release a substance into the blood that can lead to kidney failure,” according to the <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/variety-of-causes-can-be-at-root-of-rhabdomyolysis/">Mayo Clinic</a>.</p>
      <p>More specifically, a substance called myoglobin is released into the bloodstream as muscle breakdown. Too much myoglobin in the blood can lead to kidney damage, however.</p>
      <p>“Myoglobin, when it reaches the kidneys, can block the tiny tubes within the kidneys, leading to serious kidney damage and, in some cases, kidney failure,” the Mayo Clinic explains.</p>

      <p>The condition is often triggered by physical causes, such as a car accident or intense exercise. However, there are also genetic and chemical causes, and certain infections can also lead to the condition, according to <a href="https://healthline.com/health/rhabdomyolysis#treatments">Healthline.</a> The exact cause of Slusher’s case of rhabdomyolysis was not made clear.</p>
      <p>An estimated 26,000 cases of rhabdomyolysis are reported in the U.S. each year, <a href="https://www.aafp.org/afp/2002/0301/p907.html">according to a report</a> on the condition. Symptoms often include painful muscle aches, muscle weakness and/or dark “cola-colored” urine.</p>

      <p>Slusher said she was immediately treated with intravenous fluids to rid the kidneys of myoglobin. Other treatments — such as dialysis and certain medications — are used in more severe cases, according to Healthline.</p>
      <p>Slusher said she hopes to raise awareness about the condition.</p>
      <p>“I just think it needs to be part of the system that these coaches, trainers, and people that workout every day and lift need to know what it is,” she said.</p>
