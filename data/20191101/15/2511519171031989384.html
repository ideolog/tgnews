        <i>"In space, no one can hear you scream." "The horror, the horror." "Be afraid. Be very afraid."</i>
      </p>
      <p>It's easy to be lured into watching a horror film or indeed a non-serious film because of the tagline on the poster – the above few are an example of that.</p>
      <p>That's why it should be respected when a one-sheet manages to catch your attention with a tagline that manages to make you laugh.</p>
      <p>This is standard practice for a comedy – a film that's purporting to be funny should really have a hilarious tagline. But there have also been some films – action thrillers, for example – where the studio opts to go down the funny route anyway (see: <i>Bride of Chucky</i>, <i>Predator 2</i>, <i>True Lies</i>).</p>
      <p>We've compiled the funniest taglines in film history – <b>click through the below gallery to see what made the list.</b></p>
