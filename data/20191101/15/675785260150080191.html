      <h1>Jurgen Klopp states why Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain has not been starting more games</h1>
      <h2>Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain has only started twice in the Premier League this season for Liverpool as he continues to recover from his knee injury</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T15:20:08+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 15:20</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Smith</a></address>
      <p>Jurgen Klopp has explained that he has kept Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain out of his <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> starting XI because he is still finding his rhythm.</p>
      <p>Midfielder Oxlade-Chamberlain has started two Premier League games this season and has also kicked off against Liverpool and MK Dons in the Carabao Cup, along with the 4-1 victory over Genk in the Champions League.</p>
      <p>The England international only managed 19 minutes of action last season following his horrendous knee injury and despite putting in some eye-catching performances this season, with three goals in his last two appearances, is yet to return to full steam - by his own admission.</p>
      <p>Oxlade-Chamberlain said earlier this week: "Quality-wise, I am not too happy with my performance to be honest.</p>

      <p>"I wasn't great on the ball and not near my own personal level of where I want to be. I put in a good shift and run a lot.</p>
      <p>"I watch the boys of a weekend and I know what it is about here. You have got to be at a really high physical level to go and put in a performance like that.</p>

      <p>And Klopp has admitted that that is music to his ears and has deemed Oxlade-Chamberlain a "long-term project".</p>
      <p>"He has scored, nice, both at Genk, a real stunner on Wednesday, a lot of outstanding moments, but other moments he is not involved.</p>
      <p>"We always have to try to reach perfection. He still needs rhythm but that is no problem. He is a long-term project.</p>
      <p>"It is good a player thinks he is not at his best. He could think he is because he scored some goals. Quite some space for improvement. That is good.</p>
      <p>"Best shape ever before injury? He was exceptional."</p>
