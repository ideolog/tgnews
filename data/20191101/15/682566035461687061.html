      <p>London - <b>Trent Alexander-Arnold</b> has delighted Liverpool fans with not only his performances but the fact he is a locally-born player said manager <b>Jurgen Klopp</b> on Friday.</p>
      <p>The 21-year-old right-back is set to make his 100th appearance for the Premier League leaders against Aston Villa on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Klopp said Alexander-Arnold's rise to stardom had been in part due to his determination to set himself ambitious goals.</p>
      <p>"He's so young and already so experienced," said Klopp at his eve of match press conference.</p>
      <p>"It's a wonderful story for different reasons.</p>
      <p>"I know that in Liverpool everyone was desperate to have a 'scouse' hero making his way into the first team.</p>
      <p>"When he made his first appearance he said 'great, but it's not about having one game, it's about having 100'.</p>
      <p>"Now we can talk about that, and there were not a lot of bad games in that 100."</p>
      <p>Klopp, whose side lead Manchester City by six points going into this weekend's matches, praised Alexander-Arnold's attitude.</p>
      <p>"I wish for him to stay healthy and fit, and then the future's bright for him and for us," said Klopp.</p>
      <p>"He's a great role model. He's relaxed about that but feels responsible as well.</p>
      <p>"It's a pleasure to work with him."</p>
