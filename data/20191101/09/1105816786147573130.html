      <h1>Nawaz's health improves, doctors recommend against discharge</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T09:24:55+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 09:24</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/8754/our-correspondent-6/" target="_blank">​ Our Correspondent</a></address>
      <p>The health of three-time prime minister Nawaz Sharif showed further improvement on Friday as his platelet count – which had earlier reduced due to a blood disorder – reached 55,000.</p>
      <p>Nawaz has been admitted in Lahore’s Services Hospital for the past 11 days. He was diagnosed with acute idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and underwent a five-day Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIg) therapy. The former prime minister also suffered an angina attack during his hospitalisation.</p>
      <p>However, the head of the government-constituted medical board, Dr Mahmood Ayaz, recommended against discharge.</p>
      <p>The team is scheduled to run more tests. Sources informed <i>Express News</i> that the medication for ITP was affecting Nawaz’s heart and kidneys as the former premier has multiple pathologies.</p>

        <b>Acute Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura</b>
      </p>
      <p>More commonly referred to as immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), it is a disorder that can lead to easy or excessive bruising and bleeding.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/idiopathic-thrombocytopenic-purpura/symptoms-causes/syc-20352325">Mayo Clinic</a>, the bleeding results from unusually low levels of platelets — the cells that help blood clot. The symptoms include easy or excessive bruising, superficial bleeding into the skin that appears as pinpoint-sized reddish-purple spots (petechiae) that look like a rash – usually on the lower legs, bleeding from the gums or nose.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy</b>
      </p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://hms.harvard.edu/news/apparently-autoimmune">Harvard Medical School</a>, intravenous immunoglobulin is primarily used to treat other autoimmune and inflammatory conditions.</p>
      <p>Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) contains the pooled immunoglobulin G (IgG) immunoglobulins from the plasma of approximately a thousand or more blood donors, according to <a href="https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/210367-overview">E-medicine</a>.</p>
