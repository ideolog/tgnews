      <p>When it comes to <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Halloween">Halloween</a>, supermodel <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/HeidiKlum">Heidi Klum</a> is in a league of her own.</p>
      <p>The former <i>Project Runway</i> host has earned a reputation as the queen of All Hallows' Eve with her extravagant costumes including an old-age pensioner, the werewolf from <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/MichaelJackson">Michael Jackson</a>’s “Thriller” music video and Princess Fiona from <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Shrek"><i>Shrek</i></a>.</p>
      <p>For 2019, Klum pulled out all the stops, undergoing a 12-hour transformation into a nightmarish alien for her 20th Annual Halloween Party at Cathédrale New York.</p>
      <p>The model documented the making of her costume in front of a live audience as she sat in the window of an <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/amazon">Amazon</a> bookshop in <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/NewYorkCity">New York City</a> while a team of make-up artists got to work.</p>
      <p>Klum also kept her followers on <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/SocialMedia">social media</a> updated throughout the day, posting videos and photographs of the labour-intensive makeover on Twitter and Instagram. </p>
      <p>“Let’s get this party started!” Klum wrote on Thursday morning, alongside a photo of her sat in the shop window.</p>

      <p>Klum's entrance to the party was just as intense as her costume, as she was driven to the event in a vehicle made from glass, splattered with blood and covered in biohazard symbols.</p>
      <p>The model’s husband, Tom Kaulitz, accompanied her as an astronaut, covered in blood with a shattered space helmet.</p>
