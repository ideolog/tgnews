      <h1>Wilkinson's telling last-minute workshop with Owen Farrell</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T09:23:35+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 09:23</time> by <a rel="author">By Online Editors</a></address>
      <p>Jonny Wilkinson offered drop-goal guidance to <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/saracens/players/owen-farrell/">Owen Farrell</a> as <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/england">England</a> put the finishing touches to preparations for Saturday’s World Cup final against South Africa.</p>
      <p>Wilkinson was present for the week’s last training session at Tokyo’s Fuchu Asahi Football Park on the eve of the Springboks clash at <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals">International</a> Stadium Yokohama.</p>
      <p>Dressed in a grey T-shirt, black tracksuit bottoms and orange boots, he watched and gave advice as Farrell and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/england/players/ben-youngs/">Ben Youngs</a> practised drop-goals in expectation of a tight encounter between the sport’s top two ranked teams.</p>
      <p>Farrell leads England into the climax to <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/japan">Japan</a> 2019 from inside centre having recovered the dead leg sustained against <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/new-zealand">New Zealand</a> with Youngs and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/leicester/players/george-ford/">George Ford</a> forming the half-backs.</p>
      <p>Wilkinson famously struck the extra-time drop goal that clinched a 20-17 victory over <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/australia">Australia</a> in the 2003 final – his nation’s only World Cup triumph – and also started the global showpiece four years later.</p>

      <p>The 40-year-old works with Eddie Jones’ squad on an consultancy basis, offering his technical expertise on kicking to the likes of Farrell, Ford, Youngs and full-back Elliot Daly.</p>
      <p>It is believed that this is the first time he has been involved in an England training session in Japan and his wisdom has come as the clock ticks down on a seismic collision with South Africa.</p>

      <p>Farrell’s World Cup favourites will enter the repeat of the 2007 final boosted by a good luck message from the Duke of Sussex that included a photo of his son Archie in a Red Rose jersey. “As a group, we have had a couple of messages from Prince Harry,” said <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/bath">Bath</a> flanker Sam Underhill.</p>
      <p>“He sent us a nice message of support, which was nice to receive. He showed his little lad in an England shirt, so that was a nice touch. I’m still waiting on my personal message!”</p>
