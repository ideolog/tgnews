      <p>A gunman reportedly killed four people and injured several others at a college <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/halloween">Halloween</a> party in California.</p>
      <p>The bloodbath took place at an Airbnb in Orinda County where students were celebrating the holiday.</p>
      <p>At 10.45pm police were called after shots were fired.</p>
      <p>Contra Costa County Sheriff's office tweeted: "Orinda Police Department and Contra Costa County Office of the Sheriff are working a multiple shooting in Orinda.</p>
      <p>"Investigation is active. Details coming later."</p>
      <p>It is believed the students were from Laney College, a public community college in Oakland.</p>
      <p>No information has been released by the authorities regarding the victims' identities.</p>

      <p>Videos of the scene shows multiple patients being loaded into an ambulance while others limp away from the property.</p>
      <p>Around 100 people are thought to have been at the party, which was advertised on Instagram as an 'AirBNB mansion party', <a href="https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2019/11/01/orinda-sheriffs-deputies-investigate-multiple-shooting/">East Bay Times reported.</a></p>
      <p>Attendees were told to send a private message to the organisers to find out the location, and to bring their own alcohol and cannabis.</p>
      <p>The violent events follow a mass shooting that left three dead and nine others wounded in at another Halloween party in Long Beach, California on Tuesday.</p>
