      <h1>Man 'stabbed child to death' in 'Satanic exchange for eternal life and wealth'</h1>
      <h2>Denis Pozdeev is accused of killing Kirill Savenkova in the Russian Arctic port of Naryan-Mar</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T09:24:15+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 09:24</time> by <a rel="author">Milo Boyd, Will Stewart, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/milo-boyd/</a></address>
      <p>A self-confessed killer who claimed Satan ordered him to stab a child to death believed the act would make him wealthy and live forever.</p>
      <p>Denis Pozdeev allegedly evaded security at a nursery in northern Russia and stabbed six-year-old boy Kirill Savenkova.</p>
      <p>The 36-year-old, who was known to be interested in black magic, was caught on camera confessing to the act while in a police vehicle after his arrest.</p>
      <p>“I read a spell about eternal life in a book, an eternal life for my close ones and a wealthy life for myself,” he told an interrogator.</p>
      <p>Asked why he went to the kindergarten in Arctic port Naryan-Mar, he said: “A child had to be killed in order for the spell to come true.”</p>

      <p>Pozdeev, an electrician, admitted the spell had not worked and instead he would be thrown in jail.</p>
      <p>The confession footage was released as grieving mother Elena Savenkova - herself a nursery school teacher - spoke about how her son Kirill was killed when he and other children were having a midday nap.</p>
      <p>“The teacher on the phone was crying ‘We have an emergency, come in and find out’,” she said.</p>
      <p>“I thought maybe my son fell down and broke his leg…I ran towards the door and at first they did not let me in.</p>
      <p>“I almost flew inside the bedroom and he was lying all in blood there. I was told it was too late."</p>
      <p>When the heartbroken mum made it inside the classroom she was met with a disturbing sight.</p>

      <p>“When I came in, all other kids had been taken out already," she continued.</p>
      <p>“Only my child was lying on the floor, he was covered with a blanket.</p>
      <p>“His pillow was all in blood. The bloody blanket was on some other bed."</p>
      <p>According to Mrs Savenkova the teachers were in another room drinking tea when the attack happened.</p>
      <p>The mum called her husband Konstantin, a driver, who at first could not register that his son was dead.</p>
      <p>Neither of the devastated parents know the alleged killer.</p>
      <p>They have decided to wait a while before telling their daughter Elena, nine, that her brother is dead.</p>

      <p>It was revealed today that Pozdeev was earlier convicted of posting Nazi symbols and fined 1,500 roubles (£18).</p>
      <p>Questions have been raised about the security at the kindergarten and why the man was allowed to walk in.</p>
      <p>Head of the region Alexander Tsybulsky said: “It is known that an employee of the private security agency electronically opened the door to a stranger at a distance.</p>
      <p>“I have ordered to urgently check the safety of all childcare centres in the city”.</p>
      <p>While an murder investigation into Pozdeev is carried out, the kindergarten is being probed for leaving the children unsafe while they were sleeping and two security guards are facing a charge of negligence.</p>
