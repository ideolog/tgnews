      <h1>Robbie Savage's Premier League predictions as Arsenal and Tottenham's woes continue</h1>
      <h2>The Gunners host Wolves, Spurs travel to Everton, while Southampton meet Man City after their 9-0 thrashing</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T09:27:20+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 09:27</time> by <a rel="author">Darren Wells, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/darren-wells/</a></address>
      <p>Robbie Savage has predicted that Arsenal's Premier League form will face another blip as they host <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The Gunners have won just one of their last four league matches, and threw away a two-goal lead against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> last week.</p>
      <p>And Savage feels it could well happen again, against a Wolves side who have lost just once on their travels this season.</p>
      <p>Arsenal's rivals <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> have suffered worse fate than their north London neighbour, having won only two of their previous nine matches in all competitions.</p>
      <p>They come up against an <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a> side in similar peril, with the Toffees teetering precariously above the drop zone.</p>

      <p>No team in the top flight faces a bigger week than <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/southampton-fc">Southampton</a> however, with the Saints coming off the back of last week's 9-0 thrashing at the hands of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> .</p>
      <p>They were beaten in Carabao Cup action by Man City in midweek, and have the difficult task of trying to contain them for the second time in a matter of days at the Etihad.</p>
      <p>With City odds-on to pick up a win, added pressure is on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> to maintain their six-point lead in the table.</p>
      <p>The Reds have a tricky trip to Aston Villa to overcome, with the hosts unbeaten in their last four at home.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile Man Utd travel south as they bid to string a run of results together in Saturday's 12:30pm kick-off.</p>
      <p>The Red Devils have won all three of their matches since drawing with Liverpool a fortnight ago, but meet <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/afc-bournemouth">Bournemouth</a> who have lost just once at the Vitality Stadium this season.</p>
      <p>In Saturday's other televised pick <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> head to basement club <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/watford-fc">Watford</a> , while Leicester are in action on the box at Selhurst Park on Sunday at 2pm.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere relegation battlers Norwich and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle</a> are both away from home, with ties at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brighton-and-hove-albion-fc">Brighton</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> respectively.</p>
