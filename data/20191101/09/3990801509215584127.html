        <i>Our robot colleague <b>Satoshi Nakaboto</b> writes about Bitcoin <a href="https://partners.etoro.com/B9157_A72407_TClick.aspx">BTC</a> every fucking day.</i>
      </p>
      <p>Welcome to another edition of Bitcoin Today, where I, Satoshi Nakaboto, tell you what’s been going on with Bitcoin in the past 24 hours. As Descartes used to say: Do what you love and you’ll never work another day!</p>
      <h3>Bitcoin Price</h3>
      <p>We closed the day, October 31 2019, at a price of $9,199. That’s a minor 0.03 percent decline in 24 hours, or -$2.87. It was the lowest closing price in five days.</p>
      <p>We’re still 54 percent below Bitcoin‘s all-time high of $20,089 (December 17 2017).</p>
      <h3>Bitcoin market cap</h3>
      <p>Bitcoin’s market cap ended the day at $165,804,227,835. It now commands 68 percent of the total crypto market.</p>
      <h3>Bitcoin volume</h3>
      <p>Yesterday’s volume of $26,583,653,947 was the lowest in six days, 68 percent above the year’s average, and 41 percent below the year’s high.</p>
      <h3>Bitcoin transactions</h3>
      <p>A total of 290,619 transactions were conducted yesterday, which is 13 percent below the year’s average and 35 percent below the year’s high.</p>
      <h3>Bitcoin transaction fee</h3>
      <p>Yesterday’s average transaction fee concerned $0.51. That’s $3.20 below the year’s high of $3.71.</p>
      <h3>Bitcoin distribution by address</h3>
      <p>As of now, there are 13,113 Bitcoin millionaires, or addresses containing more than $1 million worth of Bitcoin.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the top 10 Bitcoin addresses house 5.4 percent of the total supply, the top 100 14.4 percent, and the top 1000 34.5 percent.</p>
      <h3>Company with a market cap closest to Bitcoin</h3>
      <p>With a market capitalization of $166 Billion, China Mobile has a market capitalization most similar to that of Bitcoin at the moment.</p>
      <h3>Bitcoin’s path towards $1 million</h3>
      <p>On November 29 2017 notorious Bitcoin evangelist John McAfee <a href="https://twitter.com/officialmcafee/status/935900326007328768">predicted</a> that Bitcoin would reach a price of $1 million by the end of 2020.</p>
      <p>He even promised to eat his own dick if it doesn’t. Unfortunately for him it’s 92.8 percent behind being on track. Bitcoin‘s price should have been $127,186 by now, according to dickline.info.</p>
      <h3>Bitcoin Energy Consumption</h3>
      <p>Bitcoin used an estimated 200 million kilowatt hour of electricity yesterday. On a yearly basis that would amount to 73 terawatt hour. That’s the equivalent of Austria’s energy consumption or 6,8 million US households. Bitcoin’s energy consumption now represents 0.3% of the whole world’s electricity use.</p>
