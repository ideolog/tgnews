      <p>AONTÚ’S Paul Lawless is kicking off his Dáil campaign next Tuesday (November 5) in the Travellers Friend Hotel at 8 p.m.</p>
      <p>Lawless, who announced his candidacy last month, also ran in the local elections in Mayo in the Claremorris Municipal District.</p>
      <p>Lawless, who has been hugely involved throughout the beef crisis and the Aontú Beef Equitable Pricing Bill, is also holding a farmers meeting on the night.</p>
      <p>Deputy Peadar Tóibín will speak on the beef crisis and the Aontú bill which has passed the first stage in the Dåil and promised cross-party support.</p>
      <p>Alo Mohan, who is widely known in the farming community for exposing corruption in the poultry industry, is a guest speaker, as well as Joe Campbell from Independent Farmers of Ireland.</p>
      <p>Said Lawless: “While the protests may be suspended the issues have not been resolved. The sugar industry disappeared overnight, and the beef will be next unless we stand up and protect it.”</p>
      <p>Lawless is also expected to unveil his plans for the second Mayo cataract bus to Belfast.</p>
      <p>He commented: “Over my local campaign, I learned first hand the issues the people of Mayo are facing, particularly the older generation; none more heart wrenching than those on waiting over three years for 15-minute cataract surgery, while their eyesight deteriorates.”</p>
      <p>“After the campaign, I set about organising a cataract bus to Belfast for those who could no longer wait. Due to the demand, I am organising a second cataract bus to Belfast. Those who are interested in travelling to Belfast under the Cross Border Directive are encouraged to attend the meeting for more information."</p>
