      <p>According to the preliminary version of testimony provided by local law enforcement officers, the woman "was killed by a reptile".</p>
      <blockquote>“She appears to have been strangled by the snake,” Indiana State Police spokesman Sgt. Kim Riley said as quoted by the Journal &amp; Courier. “We do not know that for a fact until after the autopsy.”</blockquote>
      <p>About 140 snakes were found in the house, 20 of which belonged to Hurst. <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/10/31/us/snake-python-death-trnd/index.html">According to CNN,</a> the snake was a reticulated python, which is native to southeast Asia and considered to be the longest snake in the world.</p>
      <p>The building was built as a "reptile house", and belongs to the Benton County Sheriff Don Manson; there aren't any people living there.</p>
      <p>The sheriff said that Hurst’s death was a "tragic accident with loss of human life," and that he was "being fully cooperative with everybody". The autopsy scheduled for Friday will clarify the cause of Hurst's death.</p>
