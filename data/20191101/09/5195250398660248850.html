      <h3>Find out whether the upcoming XSR 155 has what it takes to rival directly against the Bajaj Pulsar NS 160 or not</h3>
      <p>Yamaha could launch the XSR 155 in India towards the end of 2019. The motorcycle was unveiled in Indonesia recently and it became an instant hit because of its retro styling. The XSR 155 is based on the MT-15 (already available for sale in India) and will rival directly against the Bajaj Pulsar NS 160 and the Suzuki Gixxer 150 in India. <b>Here we compare the Yamaha XSR 155 against the Bajaj Pulsar NS 160.  </b></p>
      <h4>Yamaha XSR 155 VS Bajaj Pulsar NS 160: Styling comparison</h4>
      <p>The XSR 155 is the smallest and the least expensive motorcycle that joined Yamaha’s sports heritage lineup. The XSR 155 gets round full LED headlamp at the front with an integrated LED DRL lamp. The XSR 155 features a modern round shaped full digital instrument cluster that offers plenty of information to the rider.</p>
      <p>The XSR 155 has also been fitted with a wider handlebar that definitely will help maneuver the motorcycle easily in tight spaces.
