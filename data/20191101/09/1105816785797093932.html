      <p>“Having just returned from visiting Pakistan, we were horrified and deeply saddened to hear about the tragic fire on the Tezgam train near Rahim Yar Khan,” said a <a href="https://www.royal.uk/message-duke-and-duchess-cambridge-president-pakistan">statement </a>issued by the Kensington Palace.</p>
      <p>At least 74 lives were snuffed out when a blaze ignited reportedly by a cooking gas cylinder blast swept through a passenger train which was en route to Rawalpindi from Karachi on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in their message to President Alvi added, “Our thoughts and prayers are with all the people and families affected by this heart-breaking disaster.”</p>
