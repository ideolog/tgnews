      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 1): Palm oil production in Malaysia is set to drop slightly in 2020 from the 20.5 million tonnes recorded in 2019, said a plantation expert.</p>
      <p>Thomas Mielke of ISTA Mielke GmbH said Malaysia’s competitor Indonesia would also experience a slowdown of production growth by 1.8 million tonnes in 2020 to 45.4 million from the 43.6 million tonnes this year.</p>
      <p>“The consumption of palm oil will increase by 7.7 million tonnes in 2018/2019 with global supply and demand balance expected to tighten in 2019/2020 as production will only be at 78.2 million tonnes while its usage is 80-81 million tonnes,” he said in his presentation at the 15th Indonesian Palm Oil Conference.</p>
      <p><i>Bloomberg </i>reported that the lower production and higher demand would push crude palm oil price higher to trade at RM2,600 per tonne for the first half of next year.</p>
      <p>It said the commodity prices would be “considerably higher” in 2020.</p>
      <p>Mielke also noted that one of the world's largest palm oil consumers, China, was increasing imports of palm oil, [soybean] oil, sun[flower] oil and other oils to compensate smaller domestic production resulting from reduced soybean crushing.</p>
      <p>Mielke was one of the speakers during the three-day event that began on Oct 30.</p>
      <p>Other palm oil experts at the event are Dr James Fry from LMC International Ltd and Dorab Mistry from Godrej International Ltd.</p>
      <p>Themed ‘Palm Oil Industry: Managing Market, Enhancing Competitiveness’, the 15th IPOC convened as the commodity continues to be plagued by low prices and is suffering from a bad image globally, being seen as a major cause of deforestation and following the recent devastating forest and ground fires that have hit the country.</p>
