      <p>A young girl was knocked down by a car that was being <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/firearms">shot</a> at whilst she was out " <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/halloween">trick or treating</a> ".</p>
      <p>The 12-year-old was left injured and “lying in the road” after the car ploughed into her on a Liverpool street shortly before 8pm on <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/halloween">Halloween</a> night.</p>
      <p>The youngster was rushed to hospital with serious injuries, reports the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/girl-out-trick-treating-left-17182007">Liverpool Echo</a> .</p>
      <p>Locals have reported seeing a number of shots being fired at a black VW Golf before it attempted to speed out of the street.</p>
      <p>After the car hit the girl on Sceptre Road, a witness said that the occupants of the car, believed to be three or four males, then ran from the car.</p>

      <p>One man in the area said that a passenger of the car was bleeding from his face and people in the area believe one of the shots hit him through the window.</p>
      <p>He said: “It sound like maybe two or three shots had been fired and then tyres screeching.</p>
      <p>“When I came outside people were screaming and running towards the road but I didn’t know what had happened to held back a bit.</p>
      <p>“It looked like three or four lads got out of the car and ran the opposite way.</p>
      <p>“My neighbour told me that one of them was covered in blood.</p>
      <p>“The poor girl was just lying in the road but thankfully the ambulance got here very quickly. I hope she’ll be OK.”</p>

      <p>Neighbours in the area have slammed those responsible for tonight’s incident.</p>
      <p>Another resident said: “I heard she was trick or treating with her friends.</p>
      <p>“It’s absolutely disgusting they would do this. Especially on a night when so many kids would be out and about.</p>
      <p>“Nobody seems to know what’s gone on with the shooting but a little girl is now laid up in hospital, they should be ashamed of themselves.</p>
      <p>“Absolute cowards.”</p>
      <p>A cordon is currently in place on Sceptre Road with the black VW Golf visible in the middle.</p>
      <p>Forensic officers have also launched their investigation at the scene.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>A spokesperson for Merseyside Police said: “An investigation is underway following reports a male and a female were injured in Croxteth this evening, Thursday 31st October.</p>
      <p>“We were called at 7.50pm following reports that shots had been fired at a black VW Golf as it travelled along Sceptre Road. A short time later the car was in collision with a 12 year-old female pedestrian.</p>
      <p>“Shortly after the incident a male presented at hospital with a facial injury. The injury is not believed to be life threatening.</p>
      <p>“The female pedestrian has also been taken to hospital for treatment for her injuries.</p>
      <p>“Her injuries are described as serious but not life threatening.”</p>
      <p>Chief Inspector Mark Everard said: “This investigation is in its very early stages and enquiries are being carried out to establish exactly what has taken place.</p>
      <p>“I would appeal to anyone who was in the vicinity of Sceptre Road this evening who saw anyone or anything suspicious or captured anything on dash-cam footage to contact us as they may be able to assist with the investigation.</p>
      <p>“Firearms have no place on the streets of Merseyside and we are committed to finding the people responsible for using them and bringing them to justice.”</p>
      <p>In a wide-ranging statement on Thursday evening addressing anti-social behaviour on Halloween, Superintendent Paddy Kelly called the incident "serious".</p>
      <p>He said: "[It] was reported at around 7:50pm that a man had been shot whilst driving on Sceptre Road, Croxteth. A short time later, the car collided with a 12 year old girl who was out trick or treating.</p>
      <p>“This is an extremely worrying incident, where the offender/s have shown no thought for the general public and has resulted in an innocent young girl, who was out enjoying herself, experiencing this traumatic ordeal."</p>
