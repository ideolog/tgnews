      <p>Any other year, we might have said it's been a minute since <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/yelawolf/profile">Yelawolf</a> dropped new music. Yet the Alabama artist is only a few months removed from the release of <i>Trunk Muzik 3, </i>which marked his final release on Shady Records. Now, moving forward with his Slumerican banner held high, Wolf has dropped off a brand new album called <i>Ghetto Cowboy. </i>Though notably more melodic than its hard-hitting predecessor, <i>Ghetto Cowboy </i>highlights a different section of Yela's toolbox, one borne from his country and rock influences.</p>
      <p>Yet hip-hop is part of his DNA, and thus the shades remain here. "Box Chevy 7," which marks yet another chapter in the iconic long-running series, takes a more subdued approach. Heavy synthesizers and pianos combine over up-tempo percussion, while Yela pens a love letter to his longtime vehicular bud. Plus, there's also a moral or two to be found within: "If I get drunk I'ma leave her, pick her up tomorrow, don't get behind the wheel if I'm pickin' up a bottle." Go support Yelawolf and <a href="https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/yelawolf-drops-off-his-new-album-ghetto-cowboy-new-mixtape.119722.html">stream <i>Ghetto Cowboy </i>here.</a></p>

      <p>If I see two Maybachs, I'ma park it in the middle<br/>Throw my keys at the butler and then get 'em<br/>No ID, I'ma walk up through the middle<br/>Candy-coated whip like a pocket full of Skittles<br/>Money in my pocket but I don't know how to act right<br/>Glock in the glove box like a flashlight<br/>Cub in the mop-top in the backlight</p>
