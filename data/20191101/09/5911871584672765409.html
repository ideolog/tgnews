There have been a couple great originals in the bunch: “<a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2040865/lucy-dacus-my-mother-and-i/music/">My Mother And I</a>” for Mothers’ Day, “<a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2048374/lucy-dacus-forever-half-mast/music/">Forever Half Mast</a>” for Independence Day. There have also been a lot of covers: “<a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2030195/lucy-dacus-la-vie-en-rose-2019/music/">La Vie En Rose</a>” for Valentine’s Day, “<a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2060738/lucy-dacus-in-the-air-tonight-phil-collins-cover/music/">In The Air Tonight</a>” for Halloween, “<a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2057963/lucy-dacus-bruce-springsteen-cover-dancing-in-the-dark/music/">Dancing In The Dark</a>” for Bruce Springsteen’s birthday.</p>
      <p>Today Dacus shares the series’ Christmas installment. The <i>2019</i> covers have tended to be frequently covered songs, ones that have become modern standards. That’s certainly true of the yuletide offering, a rendition of Wham!’s regularly recurring “Last Christmas.” There are lots of other Christmas songs I’d rather hear Lucy Dacus sing, but it’s hard to complain about a great artist covering a great tune.</p>
      <p>There’s one more song to be heard from <i>2019</i>, an unreleased original called “Fools Gold” that I guess will be tied to New Year’s Eve. That one will arrive when the full EP drops next Friday. In the meantime, hear Dacus’ “Last Christmas” cover below.</p>
