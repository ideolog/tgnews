      <p>PHNOM PENH (AFP) - The body of a 21-year-old British tourist was found floating in the sea more than a week after she went missing from a Cambodian island, police told Agence France-Presse on Thursday (Oct 31).</p>
      <p>Amelia Bambridge was discovered in waters near the Thai border, said Chuon Narin, police chief of Preah Sihanouk province.</p>
      <p>"We found the body of the missing British woman," Narin said, adding it would be taken to nearby Sihanoukville.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>He did not speculate what happened to her after she disappeared from a beach party on the island of Koh Rong on Oct 24, but earlier this week said she may have drowned.</p>
      <p>Her brother Harry Bambridge confirmed in a Facebook post that he had identified the body.</p>
      <p>"It's my little sister Amelia," he wrote. "There's nothing more I wanted (than) to bring her back alive," he said. "I'm sorry to you Amelia Bambridge the round is on me when we meet again in heaven."</p>
      <p>The discovery brings a tragic end to a <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/cambodian-soldiers-divers-scour-island-for-missing-21-year-old-british-tourist">desperate search</a> involving more than 100 members of the police, army, navy and Bambridge's relatives.</p>
      <p>Bambridge had befriended other travellers, and the alarm was raised after she did not check out of her hostel following a party that went into the early hours on the beach.</p>
      <p>Police later found her bag and phone in the area where she was last seen at around 3.30am.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Her family members scrambled to the island to help with the investigation and have also been active on social media asking travellers for possible clues.</p>
      <p>Divers searched the waters and others combed the jungle, but for days nothing substantive was found.</p>
      <p>The mystery deepened after police <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/six-cambodians-held-as-hopes-fade-for-missing-british-tourist-0">held six men for questioning</a> but they were found not to be involved and released.</p>
      <p>Located in the Gulf of Thailand, Koh Rong is popular with backpackers.</p>
      <p>It is a two-hour boat ride from the coast and draws budget travellers with its cheap accommodation, laid-back beach bars and idyllic sunsets.</p>
      <p>But it has also undergone development in recent years, in keeping with a construction and casino boom in nearby Sihanoukville.</p>
      <p>Cambodia has long been a stop for tourists travelling around South-east Asia.</p>
      <p>Though generally safe, crimes involving foreigners have grabbed headlines in the past.</p>
      <p>This month, a Cambodian court charged three men with<a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/three-charged-with-gang-raping-french-tourist-in-cambodia"> gang-raping a French tourist</a> in the coastal province of Kampot after offering her a ride in their car.</p>
      <p>In 2013, Kampot town was rocked by the discovery of the mutilated body of a 25-year-old Frenchwoman floating in a river.</p>
      <p>A Belgian was charged with the alleged rape and murder of the woman, but released on bail due to a lack of evidence.</p>
