      <p>PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. -- A middle school student in Port Charlotte says a man asked her to get in his car while walking to school.</p>
      <p>It happened Tuesday morning on Kenesaw Street near Castlerock Lane.</p>
      <p>According to a Charlotte County Sheriff's Office report, the child told deputies that she was walking to Murdock Middle School when a maroon SUV pulled up to her. She says the man inside started asking questions and then asked her to get inside the vehicle.</p>
      <p>When the driver appeared to get upset when she refused to get in, the girl ran to the nearby homeless coalition.</p>
      <p>A witness at the coalition confirmed the child's report, and says he saw the SUV circling the area for hours before the incident.</p>
      <p>The suspect is described as a white male with dirty blonde hair and clean shaven face, chubby, wearing a baseball cap with a collared white shirt with tan stripes.</p>
      <p>The vehicle is described as a maroon 2007-2009 Jeep Liberty SUV with an unknown temporary tag.</p>
      <p>Anyone with information on this case is asked to contact the <a href="https://www.ccso.org/ContactUs/directory.cfm">Charlotte County Sheriff's Office</a> .</p>
