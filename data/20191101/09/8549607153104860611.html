        <b>The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision is one of the most important regulators for global banking standards. As per the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/basell-iii.asp">Basel III norms</a>, set by the committee in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, banks are supposed to hold a requisite amount of liquid capital based on the risk of their lending portfolio and assets held. Each type of asset is given a certain risk weight, and <a href="https://in.reuters.com/article/us-basel-banks/global-banking-watchdog-to-study-capital-requirements-for-crypto-assets-idINKBN1XA28I">according to</a> <i>Reuters</i>, the committee is introducing crypto to the mix, November 1, 2019.</b>

      <h3>Managing Liquidity and Risk in Crypto</h3>
      <p>Cryptocurrencies have been broadly classified as “risk assets” with not much resistance from any party. Market participants and businesses in the space <a href="https://btcmanager.com/cryptocurrency-cannabis-risky-investments/">understand</a> this asset class is incredibly volatile and structurally risky.</p>
      <p>The boom in crypto lending has been noteworthy, but there are several risks to loans denominated in or backed by such risky assets.</p>
      <p>Basel III norms dictate certain risk weights for each type of asset held by a bank. The committee proposes a prudent system of risk weighting for banks and lenders holding cryptoassets.</p>
      <p>Genesis Capital’s recent report <a href="https://btcmanager.com/genesis-capital-870-million-q3-loans-centralized-crypto-market/">highlights</a> the extreme demand for crypto loans. In a time where traditional financial institutions are struggling to find a demand for loans, businesses targeting crypto lending have been able to post flabbergasting growth.</p>
      <p>The introduction of Basel III norms will have positive and negative implications. On the positives, banks will be allowed to hold cryptoassets and include them in their mix of risk-weighted assets, depending on the legality of the asset class in their jurisdiction. The main negative is that the committee is likely to hold crypto to a much higher risk weight, which would discourage banks from holding it as it would increase their liquidity requirements.</p>
      <h4>Will Traditional Finance Accept Permissionless Finance?</h4>
      <p>Up till now, the change in financial technology and the political revolutions of Bitcoin have been viewed as challenges, or <a href="https://btcmanager.com/g7-report-stablecoins-risk/">obstacles</a>, to global finance.</p>
      <p>However, with regulators slowly <a href="https://btcmanager.com/european-regulators-stablecoins-warning/">easing up</a> the notion of permissionless money and financial protocols, there may be a fragment of hope for the mainstream embracement of these technologies.</p>
      <p>While this is indeed a far fetched narrative, one thing that can be banked on is the stimulation of retail sentiment for <a href="https://btcmanager.com/open-finance-scalability-ethereum/">open finance</a> protocols.</p>
