      <p>TOKYO (Nov 1): Oil prices were little changed on Friday but set for a slide of about 4% on the week hurt by rising global supply and concerns about future demand.</p>
      <p>Brent crude was down 12 cents, or 0.2%, at US$59.50 a barrel, on track for a drop of about 4% for the week.</p>
      <p>WTI crude had edged up 3 cents to US$54.22 a barrel by 0742 GMT with the US contract was set for a weekly loss of more than 4%.</p>
      <p>Worries over global economic growth, along with oil demand, continue to haunt the market as the United States and China struggle to end a 16-month dispute that has hit trade between the world's top two economies.</p>
      <p>"There's renewed doubts about a US-China trade deal... and at the same time we've had inventory lifts quite a lot more than expected at the crude level out of the US this week," said Lachlan Shaw, head of commodity research at National Australia Bank.</p>
      <p>The market received some respite from a run of poor economic data after an unexpected bounce in a private sector survey of Chinese manufacturing activity on Friday, which contrasted with dour results in an official survey Thursday.</p>
      <p>Japanese factory activity, however, sank to more than a three-year low in October, data showed on Friday, in a fresh warning sign for the world's third-largest economy.</p>
      <p>US crude inventories rose by 5.7 million barrels in the week to Oct 25, dwarfing analyst expectations for an increase of just 494,000 barrels.</p>
      <p>A <i>Reuters </i>survey showed that oil prices are likely to remain under pressure this year and next. The poll of 51 economists and analysts forecast Brent crude would average US$64.16 a barrel in 2019 and US$62.38 next year.</p>
      <p>A <i>Reuters </i>survey found output from Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) recovered in October from an eight-year low, with a rapid recovery in Saudi Arabian production from September attacks on its oil infrastructure offsetting losses in Ecuador and voluntary curbs under an international supply pact.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, US crude production soared nearly 600,000 barrels per day in August to a record of 12.4 million, buoyed by a 30% increase in Gulf of Mexico output, government data released on Thursday showed.</p>
