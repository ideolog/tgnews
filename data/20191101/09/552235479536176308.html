      <p>Westlife will be touring the UK next year with two dates in Scotland - but big cities <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/glasgow">Glasgow</a> and Edinburgh have been missed out.</p>

      <p>The tour, which covers some of the biggest outdoor venues in the UK, will conclude with Westlife’s  first-ever Wembley Stadium show on Saturday, August 22.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The Stadiums in the Summer announcement follows the phenomenal success of  Westlife's  remarkable comeback and comes as the band prepares to release their brand new album ‘Spectrum’ on 15 November.</p>
      <p>The band said: "The reaction to our comeback tour was beyond anything any of us ever imagined so we’re going to do it all over again but this time in some of the largest outdoor venues in the UK.</p>
      <p>"The shows are going to be incredible and will include all our greatest hits. We can’t wait to perform in Falkirk and Inverness."</p>
      <p>Tickets go on sale at 9am Friday November 8, with the Falkirk gig on Saturday, June 27 and Inverness on Sunday, June 28.</p>
