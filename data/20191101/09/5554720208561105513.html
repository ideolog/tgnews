      <h1>#DareArnab trends nationally as ‘pervert’ comment for innocent Delhi man comes to haunt Arnab Goswami</h1>

      <p>Republic TV’s Arnab Goswami has had to face the wrath of the news consuming public for his biases in favour of the BJP. However, this week he faced widespread backlash from hardcore supporters of the saffron party and its Hindutva agenda for calling an innocent Delhi man ‘pervert’ four years ago. This prompted Twitterati to slam Goswami while trending #DareArnab on Twitter.</p>

      <p>Goswami faced social media roasting for holding a media trial of one Sarvjeet Singh and declaring him a ‘pervert’ after a girl, identified as Jasleen Kaur accused him of molestation. Last week, a Delhi court acquitted Singh of molestation charges, triggering angry reactions from activists and social media users with most being the supporters of the BJP.</p>

      <p>Goswami worked for Times Now TV channel as its editor-in-chief. He <a href="http://www.jantakareporter.com/media-virus/arnab-goswami-resigns-times-now/72592/">left Times Now in 2016</a> to launch his own channel Republic TV with the help of BJP’s Rajya Sabha MP Rajeev Chandrasekhar. Many users also dug out his old commentary slamming Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, then a BJP MP. In one of his broadcasts, he had asked Adityanath to go for a mental check-up.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Singh <a href="http://www.jantakareporter.com/entertainment/demands-grow-for-arnab-goswami-to-apologise-after-delhi-court-acquits-man-that-his-tv-channel-dubbed-as-pervert-four-years-ago/270748/">has written</a> a Facebook post informing that one Shikha Khanduja Kaul had written a book on his case. The book, according to him, will be out soon.</p>

      <p>Singh has said on several occasions that the episode adversely impacted his life as not only did he lose his job after Kaur’s allegations but failed to get any job in the future because of being demonsied by Indian TV channels.</p>
      <p>P.S. <i>Janta Ka Reporter too had interviewed Jasleen Kaur soon after her social media post triggered a full-blown controversy. We had also invited Singh for a similar interview, which he had declined. </i></p>
