      <h2>Kids can keep their room tidy with a new Dyson toy cleaner that works like a regular vacuum</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T09:36:54+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 09:36</time> by <a rel="author">Melisha Kaur, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/melisha-kaur/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/christmas">Christmas</a> is coming and the celebrations can require a lot of cleaning.</p>
      <p>Thanks to a new <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/dyson">Dyson</a> vacuum cleaner for kids that actually works, parents will be able to get a helping hand from their little ones over the festive season.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://fave.co/2qapEsD">Dyson Toy Cordless Vacuum</a> is an exact replica of the electronics brand's latest handheld DC59 model (from £229.95, <a href="https://amzn.to/2NqCECs">Amazon</a> ) and even makes realistic noises.</p>
      <p>Online retailer Very is selling it for a reduced price of £17.99 (originally £19.99) - but the kids' cleaner is currently out of stock until November 23rd.</p>
      <p>However, parents can still pre-order the item while it's on offer.</p>

      <p>Little helpers can use the Dyson toy as a either a floor hoover or handheld cleaner, allowing them to get into all those nooks and crannies.</p>
      <p>Once you child has helped you clean around the house, they can empty all the dirt and fluff from the accessible dust compartment.</p>
