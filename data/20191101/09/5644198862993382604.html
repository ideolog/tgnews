      <p>Asian shares fell on Friday in a weak start to the month and off three-month highs struck this week on fresh concerns over Sino-U.S. trade prospects and ahead of U.S. economic data, while the dollar eased against major rivals.</p>
      <p>SHANGHAI: Asian shares scaled three-month highs on Friday as a surprise bounce in Chinese manufacturing activity eclipsed doubts raised by a Bloomberg news report over whether the United States and China can reach a long-term trade deal.</p>
      <p>Shares in Europe were set to follow Asia's lead. Pan-region Euro Stoxx 50 futures were up 0.28per cent, German DAX futures gained 0.34per cent and FTSE futures added 0.19per cent.</p>

      <p>Factory activity in China expanded at its fastest pace in more than two years in October as export orders and production rose, a private business survey showed on Friday.</p>
      <p>The expansion, which beat expectations and contrasted with the dour results of an official survey Thursday, helped to boost Chinese blue chips , which surged 1.6per cent.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong's Hang Seng added 0.65per cent and Seoul's Kospi rose 0.77per cent. The Nikkei underperformed, ending the day down 0.33per cent.</p>
      <p>MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan reversed early losses to touch fresh three-month highs, and was last up 0.4per cent.</p>
      <p>The index's performance reflected a results season that has shown companies to be more resilient than expected, said Jim McCafferty, head of Equity Research, Asia ex-Japan at Nomura.</p>
      <p>"If you look at the micro data supplied by the companies, then it tells you that customers ... are continuing to do business. So I think that we are in a better state than perhaps investors thought we were just one month ago," he said.</p>
      <p>Earlier on Friday, losses had mirrored falls in global stock markets, as MSCI's gauge of equity performance in 47 countries fell from 20-month highs after a report that cast doubt on the likelihood of a U.S.-China trade deal.</p>
      <p>On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.52per cent, the S&amp;P 500 lost 0.30per cent and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.14per cent.</p>
      <p>Efforts by Washington and Beijing to end their bruising nearly 16-month trade war appeared on track as U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday said that the two sides would soon announce a new venue for the signing of a "Phase One" trade deal after Chile cancelled a planned summit set for mid-November.</p>
      <p>Optimism was dampened by a Bloomberg report citing unnamed Chinese officials airing doubts over whether a comprehensive long-term trade deal is possible.</p>
      <p>China's doubts were "not entirely unexpected", Greg McKenna, strategist at McKenna Macro, said in a morning note to clients, noting that the falls in equity markets overnight were relatively small.</p>
      <p>Retreats in the S&amp;P 500 and the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield indicated some technical resistance in the market, he said.</p>
      <p>"Either way, today's deluge of manufacturing PMI's and then U.S. non-farm (payrolls) tonight will be an important factor in where markets head next," McKenna said.</p>
      <p>The Institute for Supply Management is due to release data from its survey of purchasing managers on Friday. A separate PMI survey released Thursday by the Chicago Fed showed a sharper contraction in midwestern manufacturing activity for October.</p>
      <p>The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes was higher at 1.6963per cent compared with its U.S. close of 1.691per cent on Thursday. The two-year yield , sensitive to market expectations of Federal Reserve policy, was at 1.536per cent, up from a U.S. close of 1.526per cent.</p>
      <p>The Fed cut interest rates for a third time this year on Wednesday to help sustain U.S. growth, but signalled there would be no further reductions unless the economy takes a turn for the worse.</p>
      <p>In the currency market, the dollar was down 0.05per cent against the yen at 107.97 .</p>
      <p>The euro was 0.1per cent higher on the day at US$1.1161, while the dollar index , which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was down 0.12per cent at 97.328.</p>
      <p>U.S. crude rose 0.28per cent to US$54.33 a barrel and Brent crude inched up 0.03per cent to US$59.64 per barrel.</p>
      <p>Spot gold eased 0.24per cent to US$1,509.54 per ounce.</p>
