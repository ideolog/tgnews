      <p>A 9-year-old <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southwest/texas">Texas</a> boy has been cleared to go home Friday after undergoing multiple <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/medical-research/surgery">surgeries</a> following a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/pets">dog</a> attack, according to reports.</p>
      <p>This week Austyn Clanton of Beaumont told a reporter what was happening in the moments leading up to the mauling.</p>
      <p>“Me and my big brother were fighting,” Austyn told Houston’s KPRC-TV. “The American bulldog jumped on me. He started biting and scratching.”</p>

      <p>According to Austyn, the dog, named Mattis, was trying to protect his older brother, Trystan.</p>
      <p>"Mattis was trying to protect Trystan and Mattis attacked me," he told Houston's FOX 26. "I got in the house but he still wouldn't get off."</p>

      <p>His father, Brad Clanton, who served as a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/military/navy">Navy</a> corpsman, described the scene inside the family’s home as “chaos.”</p>
      <p>“I’ve seen trauma. I’ve seen chaos,” the father told <a href="https://www.khou.com/article/news/local/memorial-hermann-doctors-save-9-year-old-beaumont-boy-after-family-dog-destroys-his-biceps/285-f32e4f60-7002-451d-91b5-52ca63f7b6cd">Houston’s KHOU-TV</a>. “But it’s different when it’s your child. … When it’s your own kid, you just freeze.”</p>

      <p>Austyn's mom, Vanessa Clanton said the experience was heartbreaking.</p>
      <p>"It makes you feel like you failed your child in some way because there were no signs," she <a href="https://www.fox26houston.com/news/9-year-old-boy-undergoes-several-surgeries-spends-weeks-in-hospital-after-being-attacked-by-family-dog">told FOX 26</a>. "You take a dog from 7 weeks old and you raise it until they're 3 years old, and you think your dog will never do this."</p>
      <p>News photos this week showed Austyn with scratches on his face and his left arm in a cast.</p>

      <p>Medical staff <a href="https://www.click2houston.com/health/8-year-old-boy-undergoes-7-surgeries-after-being-mauled-by-dog">told KPRC</a> that Austyn nearly died when an artery in one of his arms suddenly burst two days after a six-hour operation to repair muscle damage. Luckily, Austyn was still in the hospital.</p>
      <p>“If that tear had happened at home, there’s a potential that he would not have made it – potential that he would have lost his arm, and if the bleeding continued, possible that he would have died,” Dr. Phuong Nguyen said.</p>
      <p>The surgical team had to rebuild the blood vessel, using a microscope and “some veins and arteries nearby” the site of the rupture, Nguyen said.</p>
      <p>Doctors say Austyn also could have lost the arm at one point – but the boy joked he could have gotten a bionic one if that had happened.</p>

      <p>Vanessa Clanton, told <a href="https://abc13.com/9-year-old-almost-loses-his-arm-after-family-dog-attack/5662549/">Houston’s KTRK-TV</a> the family has relied on faith to get them through the ordeal – and was proud of the bravery Austyn has shown.</p>
      <p>“It was really impressive for him to be as chill and calm and just ready,” his father added.</p>
      <p>The dog no longer lives in the family's home, according to FOX 26.</p>
