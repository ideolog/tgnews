      <h1>Binance Enters Korean Market With New Business Entity</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T09:46:37+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 09:46</time> by <a rel="author">William Foxley</a></address>
      <p>Binance may have taken another step toward launching a crypto exchange arm in South Korea.</p>
      <p>Binance’s presence the Korean market <a href="https://www.coindeskkorea.com/60078/">was confirmed</a> Friday by CoinDesk Korea, after the company registered Binance Co. Ltd. with local authorities on Oct 29.</p>
      <p>The new arm – which has Binance CFO Wei Zhou as co-representative – comes on the heels of suggestions that Binance <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/binance-to-open-beijing-office-amid-chinas-renewed-blockchain-push">intends</a> to open a Beijing office, complementing an office in Shanghai, though it’s not to be an exchange due to local regulatory restrictions.</p>
      <p>Operating out of Malta, Binance has local entities in <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/exchange-behemoth-binance-opens-singapore-branch">Singapore</a>, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/binance-targets-eu-uk-traders-with-new-fiat-to-crypto-exchange">Jersey</a> and <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/uganda-africa-binance-crypto-unbanked-traders">Uganda</a>, as well as a partner entity in the <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/new-york-among-13-states-excluded-as-binance-us-opens-for-registrations">United States</a>. Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao also told CoinDesk recently the firm has <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/binance-ceo-russia-is-our-key-market">plans for expansion</a> in Russia, though that may not involve a new exchange branch.</p>
      <p>CoinDesk Korea reached out to Binance to confirm the acquisition of Binance Co. Ltd., a Korean entity opened this past spring by parent firm BXB Inc. The crypto exchange said: “Binance has incorporated corporations in several countries as part of its long-term business plan.”</p>
      <p>This April, CZ told CoinDesk Korea that Binance was looking for a “clear signal” from Korean regulators before moving in. The following month, Korean corporation Binance LLC registered in the country with no known affiliation to the crypto exchange.</p>
      <p>Two months later, the launch of a Korean arm seemed imminent after CZ <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/binance-eyes-launch-of-crypto-exchange-in-south-korea">confirmed conversations</a> with BXB Inc. which was also eyeing the issuance of its own won-pegged stablecoin. At the time, Binance posted a job ad for a South Korean compliance officer.</p>
      <p>With the acquisition, CoinDesk Korea says Binance will soon issue a won-stablecoin under its “Venus” project. The crypto exchange announced its stablecoin program in August.</p>
