      <h1>Steven Gerrard in emphatic Ryan Jack Rangers transfer statement as Ibrox midfielder hits top gear</h1>
      <h2>Rangers manager also paid tribute to Craig Levein as he looked ahead to Sunday's Betfred Cup semi final against Hearts.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T09:22:33+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 09:22</time> by <a rel="author">Fraser Wilson, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/fraser-wilson/</a></address>
      <p>Steven Gerrard has refused to put a price on <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/ryan-jack">Ryan Jack</a> 's head - as he insists the midfielder is going nowhere.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old is in the form of his life and was a standout in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> ' 4-0 win at Ross County on Wednesday, chipping in with two excellent goals.</p>
      <p>Jack himself admits he is playing the best football of his life, guided by midfield masters Gerrard and Gary McAllister.</p>
      <p>But in a week when Celtic boss Neil Lennon slapped a £25million price tag on James Forrest's head, Gerrard was unwilling to do likewise with his Scottish star.</p>
      <p>Former Aberdeen ace Jack has four years left on his contract at Ibrox and Gerrard, previewing Sunday's <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/betfred-league-cup">Betfred Cup</a> semi-final against <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hearts-fc">Hearts</a> , said: "I think Ryan is bringing the best out of himself.</p>

      <p>"He is the one who deserves credit and the staff, as a whole, have all helped. But Ryan is certainly someone who comes in here on a daily basis and tries to be the best training.</p>
      <p>"I'm not interested in Ryan's value, he isn't going anywhere."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Gerrard paid tribute to Craig Levein after Hearts wielded the axe on the under fire boss on Thursday, just three days ahead of the Hampden clash.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The Jambos held Rangers to a 1-1 draw just a fortnight ago. But Wednesday's 1-0 defeat to St Johnstone plunged them back level bottom of the Premiership, throwing them into turmoil ahead of Sunday's semi-final.</p>
      <p>Gerrard reckons it will have no affect on his game preparation as he looks to make up for the dismal defeat to Aberdeen at the same stage of the competition a year ago.</p>
      <p>"I never ever like to see another manager lose their job and I feel for Craig," said Gerrard. "I'm probably surprised a little bit at the timing. It can be a brutal industry at times.</p>

      <p>"It doesn't have an effect on how we prepare, of course, they may do something different with the tactics and formations but we always have that challenge going into every game.</p>
      <p>"There is pressure on Rangers to win every game, of course, a semi-final matters but we are expected to win every match.</p>
      <p>"Last year at Hampden was a blow but I am very much someone who looks forward and not behind, all we can do is control what happens going forward.</p>
      <p>"We have two forwards in great form so we certainly go into this semi-final in better shape but we have to go to our talking on the pitch, Hearts have good players and they will compete and play to their strengths.</p>
      <p>"Tynecastle was a reminder that you have to earn the right to play, you can't just turn up. You have to match the physicality in the opening stages."</p>
      <p>Allan McGregor remains a doubt for Sunday's clash but Borna Barisic will be fit after being taken off against County as a precaution.</p>
