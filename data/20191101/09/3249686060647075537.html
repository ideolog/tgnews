      <p><b>BTS</b> <b>Jimin</b> is well known for his aesthetic and fantasy-like '<b>Serendipity</b>' performance. Out of all <b>BTS Jimin</b>'s '<b>Serendipity</b>' performance, nothing can compared to this side by side video of his '<b>Black Serendipity vs White Serendipity</b>' taken on the first day second day of <b>BTS</b> Love Yourself - Speak Yourself final concert.</p>
      <p><b>BTS</b> <b>Jimin</b> who is also known for his duality during performance gave two different vibes as he looks innocent and pure with his white outfit but looks dangerously sexy with his black outfit. <b>BTS Jimin</b>'s outstanding vocal and flawless dancing skills in both video gained a lot of great reaction from fans around the world.</p>
