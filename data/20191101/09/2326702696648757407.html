      <p>If you’re currently in the market for a brand new <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/category/graphics-card">graphics card</a> that offers solid levels of performance but at a price that’s not too terrible on the bank balance, then it’s hard at present to look past the 1660 or 2060 GPUs from the <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/category/nvidia">Nvidia</a> range.</p>
      <p>As you may have noticed, however, these have been recently given something of an additional boost with the release of the ‘<a href="https://www.eteknix.com/category/super">Super</a>‘ variants. The most recent being the 1660 platform that was treated to this ‘enhanced’ release earlier this week.</p>
