      <h1>What striker Billy Clarke needs to do to force his way into Plymouth Argyle's starting line-up</h1>
      <h2>Pilgrims' boss Ryan Lowe has given his assessment of the recent free agent signing</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T09:42:33+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 09:42</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Errington</a></address>
      <p>Striker Billy Clarke is working hard to try and catch up with the fitness of the rest of his Plymouth Argyle team-mates, according to manager Ryan Lowe.</p>
      <p>The 31-year-old signed as a free agent for <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/all-about/plymouth-argyle">the Pilgrims</a> a fortnight ago after being released by Bradford City at the end of last season.</p>
      <p>Clarke spent a week training with Argyle before Lowe decided to take him on and he has already made four appearances.</p>
      <p>His first start came in the 1-0 Leasing.com Trophy defeat by Chelsea Under-21s at Home Park on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Clarke played for 62 minutes before being replaced by Joel Grant.</p>
      <p>Lowe said: “He’s not where we would like. He’s fit, and I didn’t think he would be as fit as he is, to be honest.</p>
      <p>“When we got him in for a week that’s what we wanted to see.</p>
      <p>“He was sharp but lacking that little bit of instinct, and Bill knows that. He’s working hard every day, including in the gym.</p>
      <p>“When you have a player of his calibre and professionalism he wants to get fit and he will make sure he gets fit.</p>
      <p>“But, ultimately, if you miss July, August, September and a lot of October it’s a long stint.</p>
      <p>“You can be as fit as you want. You can run the roads, you can run the treadmills, you can get the personal trainers.</p>
      <p>“You can do anything you want but football fitness is a total different game.”</p>
      <p>Clarke is one of a number of strikers at Lowe’s disposal, with the others including Grant, Byron Moore, Ryan Taylor, Klaidi Lolos and the hopefully soon-to-be-fit Dom Telford.</p>
      <p>Lowe added: “What I have got is I have got a good selection of players that I feel I can pick from.</p>

      <p>“So if Bill gets picked, he gets picked. If he doesn’t, he has to wait his turn until he gets picked.</p>
      <p>“It’s the same with all the strikers, Bill is no different. The only downfall for him is that he’s just a little bit behind in match sharpness.</p>
      <p>“It was nice to give him that run-out (against Chelsea) and he has been coming on the pitch (as a substitute) and doing well.</p>
      <p>“At some stage he’s going to knock on my door and tell me he’s ready. I will be waiting for that but when he gets the chance it’s up to him to take it.”</p>
