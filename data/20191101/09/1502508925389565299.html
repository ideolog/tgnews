      <h2>Better top-lines numbers come in despite a flattish growth in the firm's US business.</h2>

      <p>Riding on one-off gains, drug major Dr Reddy's Laboratories Limited has reported a 33 per cent jump in profit before tax, at Rs 766.4 crore, while its post-tax profit more than doubled to Rs 1,092.5 crore for the quarter ended September 2019. Th epre- and post-tax profit figures in the corresponding quarter the previous year were Rs 578 crore and Rs 503.8 crore respectively.</p>
      <p>The company has reported a 26 per cent rise in revenues, at Rs 4,801 crore for the quarter under review, from Rs 3,797.8 crore in the year-ago period despite a flattish growth in the US business.</p>
      <p>The company's top-line growth largely hinged on a Rs 722.9-crore license fee received towards the sale its anti-migraine drug to Upsher-Smith Laboratories and the receipt of Rs 345.7 crore from Celgene Company, pursuant to a settlement agreement during the quarter.</p>
      <p>Revenues from global generics in the quarter under review were up seven per cent to Rs 3,281.6 crore from Rs 3053.6 crore a year ago, while those from the pharmaceutical services and active ingredients (PSAI) division rose 18 per cent to Rs 710.7 crore from Rs 602.9 crore in the corresponding previous quarter.</p>
      <p>Sales from the proprietary products division rose nearly five fold to Rs 808.6 crore, from Rs 141.3 crore in the year-ago quarter on account of a Rs 722.9 crore license fee that the company has received on the sale of its Sumatriptan injection and nasal spray to Upsher-Smith Laboratories.</p>
      <p>Dr Reddy's said price erosion and lower volumes, besides the impact of voluntary recall of ranitidine and temporary disruption in supplies due to logistics issues have resulted in a flattish growth in formulations revenues (Rs 1,426.5 crore) in the US, despite the launch of eight products during the quarter.</p>
      <p>The overall growth in the global generics business was led by India and Emerging Markets, which grew by 9 per cent and 10 per cent, tp Rs 751.1 crore and Rs 827.6 crore, respectively, during the quarter under review.</p>
      <p>The company's gross profit margin was up 250 basis points at 57.5 per cent, from 55 per cent a year ago. However, adjusted for one-offs, normalised gross profit margin stood at 51.5 per cent, according to the company.</p>
