      <h1>Apple TV 4K is on sale for an all-time low of $90</h1>
      <h2>AT&amp;T is offering the deal, but you don't have to be a subscriber to take advantage.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T09:47:00+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 09:47</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.engadget.com/editors/christine-fisher" target="_blank">Christine Fisher</a></address>
      <p>For a limited time, you can get the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/09/27/apple-tv-4k-review/">Apple TV 4K</a> for <a href="https://www.att.com/buy/accessories/streaming-tv/apple-tv-4k-32gb-black.html">$90</a> through AT&amp;T. That's an $89 savings, and you don't need to be an AT&amp;T subscriber to take advantage of the sale. This is the lowest price we've seen yet, and you can thank the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/01/apple-tv-launches-today/">launch of Apple TV+</a> for the promotional deal.</p>
      <p>Apple TV 4K has been around for a couple years, and it's still one of our <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/09/21/apple-tv-4k-hands-on/">favorite streaming devices</a>. As you may remember, this was Apple's long-awaited entry into the 4K/HDR world, and the device delivers. 4K video looks stunning, and dark scenes look great thanks to HDR. The biggest <a href="https://www.engadget.com/products/apple/tv/4k/">potential downside</a> is that support for surround sound tops out with Dolby 7.1, meaning it doesn't support <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/01/11/dolby-atmos-vision-ces-2019/">Dolby Atmos</a>.</p>
      <p>Of course, you don't need an Apple device or Apple TV to watch the company's new streaming service. It's also available through the Apple TV app <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/10/15/apple-tv-plus-app-roku/">on Roku</a>, two <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/10/24/apple-tv-app-amazon-fire-tv-stick/">Amazon Fire TV Stick</a> devices and Samsung smart TVs. It should arrive on more streaming devices and TVs soon.</p>
      <p><b>Update 11/1/19 11:40AM ET: </b>This story was updated with additional info on the Apple TV 4K.</p>
