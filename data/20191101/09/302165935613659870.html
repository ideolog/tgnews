      <p>PONTIAN, Nov 1 — The Kukup International Ferry Terminal near here, which has been closed since last September, will be fully operational again on November 6, said Johor Mentri Besar Datuk Dr Sahruddin Jamal.</p>
      <p>He said the terminal was supposed to reopen today, but this was postponed to this Wednesday due to technical issues facing the ferry operators.</p>
      <p>“We have to postpone the reopening to November 6 to allow the ferry operators to handle the process of transferring the ferries from Puteri Harbour as well as insurance matters,” he told reporters after visiting a fish cage farming area near the terminal here today.</p>
      <p>Also present was State Public Works, Transport and Infrastructure Committee chairman Mohd Solihan Badri.</p>
      <p>The Kukup ferry terminal was closed last September 1 after the state government terminated the agreement of its concessionaire, following which the ferry operations shifted to the Puteri Harbour International Ferry Terminal in Iskandar Puteri. — Bernama</p>
