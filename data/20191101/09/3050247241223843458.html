      <h1>‘Smart Money Came In’ After First Bitcoin ETF Rejection — Analyst</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T09:07:00+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 09:07</time> by <a rel="author">William Suberg</a></address>
      <p>Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index">BTC</a>) changed its <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/volatility">volatility</a> characteristics as Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss unveiled the first Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/etf">ETF</a>), new data claims.</p>
      <p>Uploaded to <a href="https://twitter.com/woonomic/status/1190162720122736640">social media</a> by well-known statistician Willy Woo on Nov. 1, a chart of Bitcoin volatility shows a new phase beginning around March 2017. </p>
      <h3>Woo: “Smart money came in” after Winklevoss rejection</h3>
      <p>This, the time at which U.S. regulators <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/breaking-etf-denied-bitcoin-price-drops-from-1350-to-980-within-hours">rejected</a> the Winklevoss’ ETF application, was nonetheless a watershed moment for Bitcoin.</p>
      <p>“My thesis has always been that the 2017 Winklevoss ETF attempt was the first time in Bitcoin's history that it was described as a financial instrument instead of drug money,” Woo summarized.</p>
      <p>He added: </p>
      <blockquote>“It was covered in the WSJ. Smart money came in, the rise of crypto quant funds.”</blockquote>

      <h3>Bitcoin market resilience grows</h3>
      <p>According to Woo’s chart, the ETF denial formed the definitive reversal of lessening volatility which had characterized Bitcoin since 2012. </p>
      <p>Thereafter, volatility increased, albeit not to the extent seen during that year. <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/a-brief-history-of-the-secs-reviews-of-bitcoin-etf-proposals">Further ETF rejections</a> similarly failed to produce the same price impact seen in March 2017.  </p>
      <p>As Cointelegraph <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinbase-ceo-names-three-things-crypto-needs-for-mass-adoption">reported</a>, volatility nonetheless remains a point of reflection for market participants keen to attract more new investment into the cryptocurrency space.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, Brian Armstrong, CEO of cryptocurrency exchange <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/coinbase">Coinbase</a>, highlighted the need to reduce the impact of volatility through the use of instruments such as <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/stablecoin">stablecoins</a>.</p>
