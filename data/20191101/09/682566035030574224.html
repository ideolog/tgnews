      <p>Cape Town - <b>Arsenal</b> midfielder <b>Dani Ceballos </b>wants to repay the faith shown in him after he missed a penalty against <b>Liverpool </b>on Wednesday night.</p>
      <p>The Gunners crashed out of the Carabao Cup after a penalty shootout at Anfield, with Ceballos the only man to miss on Merseyside.</p>
      <p>The two English giants had earlier played out a thrilling 5-5 draw during the 90 minutes with Arsenal twice losing a two-goal lead against Jurgen Klopp's men.</p>
      <p>Lucas Torreira, Gabriel Martinelli, Ainsley Maitland-Niles and Joe Willock all scored inside the 90 minutes for the visitors.</p>
      <p>However, two efforts from Divock Origi ensured Liverpool got the chance to progress into the quarter-finals on penalties.</p>
      <p>Liverpool keeper Caoimhin Kelleher saved Ceballos' strike to ensure the Reds won 5-4 in the shootout.</p>
      <p>Arsenal boss Unai Emery remains under intense pressure but Mesut Ozil's fabulous performance will have given him some hope after a slow start to the season.</p>
      <p>The Gunners have now won just two of their last five matches, and Ceballos took to Twitter to apologise for his part in the defeat.</p>
      <p>He tweeted:<b><i>"I will never stop failing for not trying. I will never hide for fearing a failure. If I would have today the opportunity, I would assume the responsibility without a doubt. I am sorry for my supporters, but I want you to know that I will give my soul for the team."</i></b></p>
      <p>The playmaker will be hoping his error is not enough for him to lose his place in the team for Saturdayâ€™s meeting with Wolves at the Emirates Stadium.</p>
      <p>He has made 10 appearances since joining on a season-long loan deal from Real Madrid but reports also claim the 23-year-old would like to join on a permanent basis in the summer.</p>
      <p>Ceballos could now compete with Ozil for the number 10 role after Emery confirmed the former Germany international is still part of his plans.</p>
