      <h1>Media Prima’s shares close at five-month low after lay-off rumours</h1>

      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 1 — Media conglomerate Media Prima Bhd’s shares fell to 35 sen per unit at market closing today, amid rumours of a new round of downsizing earlier today.</p>
      <p>The share price is its lowest since June this year.</p>
      <p>By comparison, it had opened at 36.5 sen per unit earlier today.</p>
      <p>Media Prima’s shares have not risen above the 40 sen per unit threshold since mid-October, despite hovering near the 48 sen per unit mark between July and early last month.</p>
      <p>The price of its shares fell in mid-October after an announcement on October 9 that Aurora Mulia Sdn Bhd, linked to tycoon Tan Sri Syed Mokhtar al-Bukhary, had gained close to one-third of its stake.</p>
      <p>Earlier today, financial paper <i>The Edge</i> reported that a meeting among heads of departments was called this afternoon to discuss the outcome of a board of director's meeting earlier this morning.</p>
      <p><i>Malay Mail</i> understands the meeting is still ongoing and staff members have not been informed of its decision.</p>
      <p>It is rumoured that the company will axe as much as one-third of its workforce.</p>
      <p>Last year, its subsidiary and TV3 station operator, Sistem Televisyen Malaysia Bhd, retrenched 190 employees by giving them three months' notice, while mutual separation schemes were offered to 43 others.</p>
      <p>In the second quarter of the year, Media Prima posted a net loss of RM8.83 million, as traditional revenue segments, including publishing and television networks, have seen lowered contributions.</p>
      <p>It has seen a string of quarterly losses since the third quarter of 2016, with the exception of the fourth quarter of that year, and the second and fourth quarter of 2018.</p>
      <p>Media Prima owns the New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad, with the newspapers <i>New Straits Times</i>, <i>Berita Harian</i> and <i>Harian Metro</i> under it, as well as four television channels, TV3, NTV7, 8TV and TV9.</p>
