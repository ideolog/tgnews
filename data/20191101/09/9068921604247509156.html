      <p>In the United States, the $49.99 annual subscription provides a savings of $9.89 per year compared to a $4.99 per month subscription, which totals $59.88 in a year. In other words, the annual subscription effectively provides 12 months of Apple TV+ access for the price of 10 months for paying upfront. <br/><br/>To switch to the annual subscription plan on an iOS device, open the TV app, tap on your profile in the top-right corner, tap on Manage Subscriptions, tap on Apple TV+, and select the one-year option. Those with a free one-year trial will not be billed until expiration of that trial on October 31, 2020 or later. <br/><br/>Apple TV+ launched today and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/11/01/apple-tv-plus-launch/">here is everything to know</a>.</p>
