      <h1>UK manufacturing decline slows after new Brexit stockpiling rush: PMI</h1>

      <p>LONDON (Nov 1): A renewed rush to stockpile ahead of another aborted Brexit deadline limited losses for British manufacturers last month, though not by enough to prevent a sixth month of contraction, a survey showed on Friday.</p>
      <p>The IHS Markit/CIPS UK Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) rose to 49.6 from 48.3 in September, its highest level since April and topping all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists that had pointed to a reading of 48.1.</p>
      <p>However, the index still remained below the 50 dividing line between growth and contraction.</p>
      <p>October’s PMI was flattered by manufacturers building stocks ahead of the Oct. 31 date for Brexit that was superseded this week by a Jan. 31 deadline, survey compiler IHS Markit said.</p>
      <p>Britain will also hold an early national election on Dec. 12 as Prime Minister Boris Johnson tries to break the Brexit deadlock.</p>
      <p>Uncertainty around Britain’s exit from the European Union, originally scheduled for March 29, had previously prompted factories to load up on parts at the fastest rate in the 27-year history of the PMI surveys in early 2019.</p>
      <p>That spurred a brief increase in manufacturing output which gave way to a sharp downturn in mid-2019, exacerbated by a slowing global economy.</p>
      <p>The latest official figures show that factory output fell by 1.7% in the year to August, and the Confederation of British Industry said last week that manufacturers reported the bleakest outlook since 2009.</p>
      <p>October’s PMI data showed that new business continued to decline, despite the fastest growth in export orders since December 2018 as EU customers stocked up on parts from British suppliers - a sign that domestic demand was especially weak.</p>
      <p>“The underlying picture looks even darker than even these disappointing headline numbers suggest,” IHS Markit director Rob Dobson said.</p>
      <p>“Output and new orders fell despite short-term boosts from stock-building activity in advance of the October 31 Brexit deadline, which included a rise in exports as clients in the EU sought to mitigate supply risk.”</p>
      <p>Compared with its long-term average, the elevated level of the stocks of purchases index added 0.8 points to the headline PMI.</p>
      <p>IHS Markit said Brexit uncertainty had hurt the investment goods industry hardest as customers postpone or cancel capital spending.</p>
      <p>“With a further Brexit extension confirmed and the prospect of a December general election, it looks as if the specter of uncertainty will cast its shadow over manufacturing for the remainder of 2019,” Dobson said.</p>
