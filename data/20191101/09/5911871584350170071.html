      <h1>Teyana Taylor &amp; Kehlani – “Morning” Video</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T09:53:47+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 09:53</time> by <a rel="author">Tom Breihan</a></address>
      <p>Last year, the R&amp;B singer Teyana Taylor released with the Kanye West-produced album <i><a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2002941/stream-teyana-taylors-new-kanye-produced-album-k-t-s-e/music/album-stream/">K.T.S.E.</a></i>, probably the second-best album of West’s series of Wyoming-produced records. Right now, she’s working on the follow-up. Taylor’s next album, which doesn’t have a release date yet, is called <i>The Album</i>. In August, she teamed up with Diddy’s son King Combs for the extremely ’90s first single “<a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2053464/teyana-taylor-how-you-want-it-feat-king-combs/video/">How You Want It?</a>” Today, she’s come out with another song, and this seems likely to get a whole lot more attention.</p>
      <p>On the new track “Morning,” Taylor teams up with fellow R&amp;B singer-songwriter Kehlani, another gifted performer who gets extremely personal. “Morning” is slow and hazy, and it is a total sex song on every level. Both Taylor and Kehlani get very explicit, and they do it with a slow warmth that never feels raunchy.</p>
      <p>Taylor directed the video herself, and I have a feeling that it’s going to do well. It’s a sultry, noir-influenced clip, and Taylor and Kehlani spent the entire video pretty much all over each other. They get it on in a hot tub and in a darkroom, and they’re the only people onscreen the entire time. You have probably already figured out if this is something you’d be interested in seeing. It’s below.</p>
