      <p><i>“It’s not like an update it’s just like testing some variant,” </i>Steiner said to <i><a href="https://www.racefans.net/2019/11/01/haas-to-test-new-front-wing-after-going-in-wrong-direction-this-year/">RaceFans.</a></i> </p>

        <i>“The rest of the car, we didn’t get it wrong because I mean we still qualify maybe seven, eight races with two cars in Q3. So we didn’t do that wrong. Now as I said, we found out what we did wrong and therefore I’ve got full confidence we can get back there.”</i>
