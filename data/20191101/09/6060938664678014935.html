      <p>WELLINGTON: New Zealand captain <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Kane-Williamson">Kane Williamson</a>'s bowling action was given the all-clear Friday after he was reported during the first Test against Sri Lanka in August.</p>
      <p>The right-handed batsman and occasional off-spinner came under scrutiny in Galle during a Test that Sri Lanka won by six wickets.</p>
      <p>He subsequently underwent a bowling assessment in England last month, where his action met the elbow extension angle permitted under ICC rules.</p>
      <p>"The <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/International-Cricket-Council">International Cricket Council</a> today confirmed that the bowling action of New Zealand captain Kane Williamson has been found to be legal, and he can continue bowling in international cricket," the ICC said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Williamson is not playing in the ongoing home Twenty20 series against England after a recurring hip injury flared up.</p>
      <p>England won the opening game on Friday by seven wickets.</p>
