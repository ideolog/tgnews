      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T09:20:55+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 09:20</time> by <a rel="author">James Rodger, Luke Matthews, https://www.facebook.com/jamesrodgerjournalist</a></address>
      <p>A mum-of-two has sparked a fierce parenting debate - after admitting to putting her kids to bed wearing the NEXT DAY'S clothing.</p>
      <p>Lisa Lamond is a star of Australian renovation show House Rules, and has shed light on her somewhat bizarre trick.</p>
      <p>The mum revealed her rather unusual hack to save time in the mornings.</p>
      <p>Every morning, mums and dads will be rushed for time, trying to feed their kids breakfast, get them dressed - and prepare for work themselves.</p>
      <p>But Lisa revealed she and her husband Adam have devised a canny plan.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/lifestyle/family/mum-puts-children-bed-wearing-20783040">Mirror Online</a> reports the pair share two young daughters, Arabella, 3, and Ruby, 2.</p>

      <p>"My daughters like to dress themselves from head to toe," Lisa told  <a href="https://www.whimn.com.au/love/family/lisa-lamond-on-putting-her-daughters-to-bed-in-tomorrows-clothes/news-story/b192ae4dbba553e16cb857de8a4efb93">Whimn</a>  . "On days I’m working in particular, I don’t have a spare hour while they pull up one sock.</p>
      <p>"So the best piece of advice I’ve been given is to dress your kids the night before in the clothes you want them to go out in."</p>
      <p>The next day she simply wakes them up, changes their nappy, puts on their shoes and they head out of the door, adding: "It works wonders for me and where I'm at in life at the moment."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Lisa also recommends negating the hassle of the weekly shop with two young children in tow by taking advantage of online supermarket delivery and says she always leaves Sunday as a family day to spend quality time together.</p>
      <p>As well as mornings, bath times are often challenging, with Lisa describing them as 'the bane of my existence'.</p>
      <p>Using her negotiating skills, the mum and her offspring came to the agreement she could wash their hair if they were allowed to fill the bath with slime. Seems fair.</p>

      <p>With one of her daughters becoming attached and struggling with having to go to kindergarten, Lisa says she devised a morning and evening routine, printed out with words and pictures to follow along, helping the little one to preempt what's to come when she's feeling anxious.</p>
      <p>She also urged fellow parents not to compare themselves to others, admitting at one stage she wouldn't go out because she thought she couldn't control her daughters and felt embarrassed.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"We all have our own pace and ways of coping," she added. "But I got over it and learned how to diffuse the situation."</p>
