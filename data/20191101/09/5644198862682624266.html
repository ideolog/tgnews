      <p>Asian shares fell on Friday in a weak start to the month and off three-month highs struck this week on fresh concerns over Sino-U.S. trade prospects and ahead of U.S. economic data, while the dollar eased against major rivals.</p>
      <p>SHANGHAI: Asian shares fell on Friday in a weak start to the month and off three-month highs struck this week on fresh concerns over Sino-U.S. trade prospects and ahead of U.S. economic data, while the dollar eased against major rivals.</p>
      <p>Chinese officials doubt that a comprehensive long-term trade deal with Washington and U.S. President Donald Trump is possible, Bloomberg reported on Thursday, citing unnamed sources.</p>

      <p>The latest blow to hopes that the world's two largest economies will reach a deal to end their bruising nearly 16-month trade war comes despite comments from Trump on Thursday that the countries would soon announce a new site for the signing of a "Phase One" trade deal after Chile canceled a planned summit set for mid-November.</p>
      <p>MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 0.09per cent on the day, and about 0.5per cent lower than three-month highs touched Thursday.</p>
      <p>The losses in Asia mirrored falls in global stock markets on Thursday, as MSCI's gauge of equity performance in 47 countries fell from 20-month highs. The index continued to ease on Friday, trimming 0.07per cent.</p>
      <p>Japan's Nikkei slid 0.63per cent in early trade, and Australian shares were 0.12per cent lower.</p>
      <p>News of China's doubts over a trade deal was "not entirely unexpected", Greg McKenna, strategist at McKenna Macro, said in a morning note to clients, noting that the falls in equity markets were relatively small.</p>
      <p>Retreats in the S&amp;P 500 and the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield indicated some technical resistance in the market, he said.</p>
      <p>"Either way, today's deluge of manufacturing PMI's and then U.S. non-farm (payrolls) tonight will be an important factor in where markets head next," McKenna said.</p>
      <p>The Institute for Supply Management is due to release data from its survey of purchasing managers on Friday. A separate PMI survey released Thursday by the Chicago Fed showed a sharper contraction in midwestern manufacturing activity for October.</p>
      <p>The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes was a touch higher at 1.6927per cent compared with its U.S. close of 1.691per cent on Thursday. The two-year yield, sensitive to market expectations of Federal Reserve policy, was at 1.5279per cent compared with a U.S. close of 1.526per cent.</p>
      <p>The Fed cut interest rates for a third time this year on Wednesday to help sustain U.S. growth, but signaled there would be no further reductions unless the economy takes a turn for the worse.</p>
      <p>In the currency market, the dollar was a touch weaker against the safe-haven yen, trimming 0.06per cent to 107.95 .</p>
      <p>The euro was 0.04per cent higher on the day at US$1.1155, while the dollar index , which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was down 0.07per cent at 97.285 on the day. The dollar index has fallen 0.56per cent this week.</p>
      <p>U.S. crude ticked up 0.26per cent to US$54.32 a barrel and Brent crude rose 0.07per cent to US$59.66 per barrel.</p>
      <p>Spot gold eased, trimming 0.04per cent to US$1,512.57 per ounce.</p>
