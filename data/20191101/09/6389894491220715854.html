      <p>The eagerly-anticipated appointment of the new Bank of England governor has been pushed back until after the general election.</p>
      <p>Chancellor Sajid Javid has delayed the announcement of a successor to Mark Carney, who is leaving the role on Threadneedle Street at the end of January next year.</p>

      <p>Javid was originally expected to unveil Carneyâ€™s replacement this autumn, but Treasury sources say he has put the decision on hold due to the sensitive timing around the current election.</p>
      <p>If the current Conservative government wins the 12 December election, it is expected to name its appointment soon after the result.</p>
      <p>The move comes amid BBC reports that Minouche Shafik, the head of the London School of Economics, is the current favourite to take on the top job in banking.</p>

      <p>Shafik is one of several candidates being mooted by the government.</p>
      <p>Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) boss Andrew Bailey, deputy governors Jon Cunliffe and Ben Broadbent, and former BoE lifer Sir Paul Tucker are all understood to have been in the running.</p>
      <p>Santander chair Shriti Vadera is also thought to have made the shortlist.</p>
      <p>The successor to Mark Carney will be taking over the central bank at a pivotal time for the UK economy, as Britain prepares to leave the EU by a newly-extended deadline of 31 January.</p>
      <p>Brits will be heading to the polls before Christmas to vote in a new general election which was agreed in Parliament earlier this week.</p>
