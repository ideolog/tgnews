      <p>CAPE CORAL, Fla. â€“ Cape Coral will be the site of the new Family Initiative Autism Support Center early next year.</p>
      <p>Local leaders joined more than 100 people for the groundbreaking in Southwest Cape Coral on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The center will provide brand new clinical services to children and teens on the autism spectrum. It will also be a support location for families with additional resources.</p>
      <p>The president of the center says new space will help further serve the community.</p>
      <p>"We want this space to be as flexible as possible, so it's going to offer a lot of different opportunities for families. Activity space, space to provide clinical services...I think most important to us, a space to provide education and training and facilitate conversation," said David Brown.</p>
      <p>The building is named after Senator Lizbeth Benaquisto, in honor of her support for the organization.</p>
