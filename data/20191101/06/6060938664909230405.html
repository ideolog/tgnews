      <h1>When Rajkummar Rao waited for 6-7 hours outside Mannat to see Shah Rukh Khan</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T06:07:38+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 06:07</time> by <a rel="author">TIMESOFINDIA.COM</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Rajkummar-Rao">Rajkummar Rao</a> is one of Bollywood’s biggest and brightest stars who has impressed all with his variety of film roles. From playing the romantic hero to the comic caper and even picking up laurels along the way, he continues to prove he still has a lot more to showcase on the big screen. Despite the fame and critical acclaim, Rajkummar’s love for <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Gauri-Khan">Shah Rukh Khan</a> will never die.</p>
      <p>The actor, who has admitted several times that he is a hardcore SRK fan, revealed in a recent chat with Neha Dhupia, that he used to stand outside Mannat – Shah Rukh’s residence, and wait for over 6-7 hours just to get a look at him. Although he never did see the actor then, he seemed pretty elated even to catch a glimpse of <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Gauri-Khan">Gauri Khan</a>.</p>
      <p>A few years down the line, Rao is now “good friends” with King Khan and when not partying it up together, the actor says he knows he can always call or message the superstar.</p>
      <p>Early this year, Rajkummar had his dream come true when he shook a leg with SRK on-stage at the Filmfare awards. Their sweet exchange of words on social media won over fans and quickly made headlines.</p>
