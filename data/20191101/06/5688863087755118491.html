        <b>Rohit Sharma has stated that it is an absoulote honour for him to lead the Indian team, even though it is for one series. The newly-positioned Indian Test opener has also added that he was personally looking forward to the day-night Test against Bangladesh at the Eden Gardens from November 22.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/rohit_sharma">Rohit Sharma</a>'s tactical nous as captain has never been understated for the simple fact that he has led <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/team/mumbai_indians">Mumbai Indians</a> to four IPL titles, and whenever he was given the responsibility of leading India, he delivered. By guiding India to <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/tournament/asia_cup">Asia Cup</a> title in alien conditions of Dubai, Rohit ensured that he had it in him to be the perfect leader of men.</p>
      <p>As India are slated to take on Bangladesh in a three-match T20 series, with <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/virat_kohli">Virat Kohli</a> rested, Rohit Sharma will lead the side once again. On being asked about if the occasional captaincy duties burden him, the stand-in delivered a punchline.</p>
      <p>"These things (captaincy) are not in our hands. One or 100 matches, it is an honour," Rohit said in a promotional event in New Delhi, reported PTI.</p>
      <p>"When we were growing up, it was all about playing for the country. I have captained the team and the experience has been good and I don't think about how long I should be made captain. Whenever I get the chance to captain the team, I try and enjoy that."</p>
      <p>After the completion of T20I series, India will take on Bangladesh in a two-match Test series, with the second Test at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata being a Day/Night One. While there have been quite a few talks surrounding the impact of dew, Rohit brushed aside the fact and stated that he is personally looking forward to it.</p>
      <p>"I am very excited as it is the first time. I can't say about others, but I played one match in <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/tournament/duleep_trophy">Duleep Trophy</a> with the pink ball and it was a good experience. The opportunity has come and will try to do well.Â I always try to do well and for me, the thought is to not stop. My job is to keep performing and I see it that way. Be it Bangladesh or West Indies after that, or when we go to New Zealand," he said.</p>
