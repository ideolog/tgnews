      <p>ZURICH/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Novartis said a trial fell short of producing statistical evidence that its anti-inflammatory drug Cosentyx can beat the world’s best-selling drug Humira in treating a type of arthritis.</p>

      <p>The Swiss pharma giant said on Friday that Cosentyx, used in a trial to treat active psoriatic arthritis, yielded “numerically higher results versus Humira” but the statistical readout was not reliable enough to count as evidence.</p>
      <p>The Swiss group said that Cosentyx, its second-bestselling drug with $2.8 billion in revenue last year, “narrowly missed statistical significance for superiority” over Humira, a drug made by AbbVie..</p>
      <p>Cosentyx is already approved for use in psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis and other conditions, and a clear win over auto-immune disease treatment Humira would have boosted its sales prospects.</p>
      <p>Still, Novartis said it hoped the full trial data on easing symptoms such as tender or swollen joints, to be disclosed later at a medical conference, would convince physicians.</p>
      <p>“We view the results as confirming our vision of Cosentyx becoming standard of care in psoriatic arthritis,” said Eric Hughes, the company’s head of development in immunology, hepatology and dermatology.</p>
      <p>The drugmaker has said it believes its product could achieve peak annual sales of $4 billion to $5 billion thanks to its broad potential.</p>
      <p>Abbvie’s Humira, in turn, chalked up close to $20 billion in sales in 2018, but the drug has come under fire from cheap rivals in Europe and faces a loss of patent protection in the United States in 2023.</p>
      <p>Novartis stock was little changed at 86.14 Swiss francs at 0910 GMT.</p>
      <p>Psoriatic arthritis affects around 50 million people worldwide.</p>
      <p>This week U.S. regulators halted a trial of Novartis’s Zolgensma treatment after an animal study raised safety concerns.</p>
      <p>In other setbacks, Novartis’s heart failure drug Entresto failed a trial in a new use, the Swiss drugmaker said in July, calling into question billions of dollars in potential revenue and taking the shine off one of the company’s biggest growth prospects.</p>
