      <p>The Pharmarcists Council of Nigeria (PCN) on Thursday said 14.4 million Nigerians are currently engaged in illicit drug use.</p>
      <p>The PCN gathered critical stakeholders in Kaduna to brainstorm on alarming statistics on drug use prevalence in Nigeria and the way forward.</p>
      <p>The Registrar, PCN, Elisha Mohammed, said, curiosity and peer pressure were major factors pushing people especially school children and young persons into non-medical drug use.</p>
      <p>The News Agency of Nigeria reports the seminar was on drugs and substances abuse in North-west organised by the PCN and Codeine Control and other Related Matters Working Group.</p>
      <p>It was to provide a platform of interaction to increase awareness on effects of illicit drugs in the zone.</p>
      <p>According to Mr Mohammed, the World Drug Report 2019, has put drug use prevalence in Nigeria at 14.4 per cent, “representing 14.4 million Nigerians aged 15 to 64 years”.</p>
      <p>He said that the figure was comparatively higher than the global prevalence rate.</p>
      <p>Mr Mohammed said the Council was pained by the development, as it affected the country’s productive population.</p>
      <p>Speaking on the topic: Curbing the manace of drug abuse through information, education and communication, Oluwatoyin Odeku said illicit drugs use should be of serious concern to all Nigerians.</p>
      <p>According to her, the use of illicit drugs have led to brain damage which is quite expensive to manage at rehabilitation centres.</p>
      <p>“Drug abuse kills. Drug abuse truncates future. Children please don’t be involved in drug abuse.</p>
      <p>“You have a great future. God has deposited a lot of potentials in you. Drug abuse affect the way your body performs. It affect important part of your body.</p>
      <p>“It changes your brain chemistry. It takes control of your brain because it has affected the brain, some will become repressive or depressive. They look unkept. They engage in strange behaviour.</p>
      <p>“The issue of drug abuse is a a big problem in Nigeria and all of us must come together to come up with the way forward.</p>
      <p>“There should be surveillance on emerging drugs whereby the government will be strategically positioned to know about the emerging drugs with a view to nip it in the bud early enough,” she urged.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Daniel Omokachi, a former football star, in an interview with reporters shortly after the event, said there was need to sensitise young Nigerians on the implications of drug abuse.</p>
      <p>Mr Omokachi said sports should be used to take the youth away from drugs and other social vices.</p>
