      <p>Nintendo has announced that it will begin testing a multiplayer option for its <i>Mario Kart Tour</i> mobile game in December, a step towards the full multiplayer mode that's considered essential to the mobile title's success. <br/><br/>The announcement came on Friday via the Japanese video game giant's official <a href="https://twitter.com/mariokarttourEN/status/1190074083100123137?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1190074083100123137&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.macrumors.com%2F2019%2F11%2F01%2F%2F">Twitter account</a> and explained that access to multiplayer would initially be limited to <i>Mario Kart Tour</i> Gold Pass subscribers. <br/><br/><i>Mario Kart Tour</i> for iOS and Android devices currently lacks the option to race against friends, leaving it shorn of the vital game mechanic that has helped make it one of Nintendo's longest running franchises on console.</p>

      <p>Nintendo's latest smartphone app was downloaded over 90 million times in its first week, according to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/10/03/mario-kart-tour-90-million-downloads-first-week/">Sensor Tower</a>. The number eclipses both <i>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp</i> and <i>Super Mario Run</i>, which were downloaded a respective 14.3 million times and just under 13 million times in their debut week, making <i>Mario Kart Tour</i> Nintendo's biggest mobile game launch to date. <br/><br/>Announced in January 2018, the game was delayed several times before its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/09/25/mario-kart-tour-now-available-for-iphone-and-ipad/">debut</a> in September. The game's optional "Gold Pass" subscription introduces various in-game items and badges and also unlocks the faster 200cc mode. Nintendo is offering a two-week free trial, after which it costs $4.99 a month. <br/><br/><i>Mario Kart Tour</i> is a free download from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/app-store/">App Store</a>, requires iOS 10 or later to play, and officially supports iPhone 5s or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> Air and later devices. A Nintendo Account is also required to play the game. [<a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/mario-kart-tour/id1293634699?mt=8&amp;ign-mpt=uo%3D4">Direct Link</a>]</p>
