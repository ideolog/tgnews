      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Nokia (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/NOKIA.HE">NOKIA.HE</a>) is targeting Malaysian ports in a bid to get a share of the country’s fifth-generation (5G) technology market, as the Southeast Asian country prepares to launch the ultra-fast mobile internet service next year.</p>

      <p>The Finnish company worked with Germany’s Port of Hamburg last year to test the technology in traffic-lights management, data processing from mobile sensors and virtual reality, and is keen to build on that experience in Malaysia, Siva Shanmugam, head of Nokia in Malaysia, told Reuters.</p>
      <p>Nokia’s push comes at a time when it expects to face tough competition from China’s Huawei [HWT.UL], the world’s largest telecoms equipment maker, that has already signed 5G deals with telecoms firms in Malaysia as it battles a U.S. blacklist.</p>
      <p>“Nokia is assessing the type of end-to-end use cases for 5G in Malaysia,” Shanmugam said in an email late on Thursday. “One area we are exploring is applying our global learnings to industrial applications; specifically for port operations.”</p>
      <p>Malaysia is an important shipping center because two of Southeast Asia’s busiest maritime corridors - the Malacca Strait and the South China Sea - run through its waters. The country has seven major federally controlled ports, with Port Klang being the 12th busiest in the world last year.</p>
      <p>Shanmugam said Nokia was also working with three telecoms customers in Malaysia, including U Mobile, on 5G live trials.</p>
      <p>Huawei has already signed an agreement with Maxis (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/MXSC.KL">MXSC.KL</a>), Malaysia’s No.2 mobile network operator by subscribers, to launch 5G services. It also has a preliminary 5G deal with Axiata Group Bhd’s (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/AXIA.KL">AXIA.KL</a>) Celcom.</p>
      <p>Huawei has been facing mounting international scrutiny over the past year amid U.S. allegations that its equipment could be used by Beijing for spying, a concern it has said is unfounded.</p>
      <p>Washington put the Chinese firm on a blacklist in May and has urged its allies to ban Huawei from building 5G networks.</p>
      <p>Asked how Nokia would counter Huawei’s cost-competitiveness, Shanmugam cited its global footprint of 48 5G commercial deals and “unique end-to-end portfolio”.</p>
      <p>“This will enable Nokia to provide significant differentiation of 5G use cases in Malaysia,” he said.</p>
      <p>Nokia, whose other rival in the telecom network equipment business is Sweden’s Ericsson (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/ERICb.ST">ERICb.ST</a>), has hired hundreds of engineers in Finland to speed up its 5G development.</p>
