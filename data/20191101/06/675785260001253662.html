      <h1>McDonald's apologises for 'Sundae Bloody Sundae' slogan on ice-cream promotion</h1>
      <h2>A McDonald's spokesperson said only 'a small number of restaurants' had ran the slogan</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T06:44:42+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 06:44</time> by <a rel="author">Elaine McCahill, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/elaine-mccahill/</a></address>
      <p>McDonald's has apologised for using the 'Sundae Bloody Sundae' slogan on an ice-cream promotion in Portugal.</p>
      <p>Bloody Sunday refers to one of the worst days during the Troubles in Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p>It saw 13 people shot dead by the British Army on the 30th January 1972.</p>
      <p>Another man died four months after the attrocity.</p>
      <p>The ad went viral after an Irish customer posted a picture of it on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> .</p>
      <p>The caption read: "Portugal is cancelled."</p>
      <p>Following the social media backlash, the fast food chain said they did not intend to invoke memories of the Troubles by using the ad to promote their two-for-one offer.</p>

      <p>McDonald's Portugal said in a statement: "When promoting its <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/halloween">Halloween</a> Sundae ice cream, McDonaldâ€™s Portugal developed a local market activation for a small number of its restaurants in Portugal.</p>
      <p>"The campaign was intended as a celebration of Halloween, not as an insensitive reference to any historical event or to upset or insult anyone in any way.</p>
      <p>"We sincerely apologise for any offence or distress this may have caused."</p>
      <p>Sunday Bloody Sunday is the name of a song by Irish rock band U2 which was released in 1982.</p>
