        <b>MILAN, Italy, Nov 1<i> – </i>It is early days in Inter Milan’s pursuit of perennial Serie A pacesetters Juventus, but already the chasers are worrying about flagging.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Inter travel to Bologna on Saturday in the 11th round and can briefly overhaul Juventus ahead of the Turin derby later in the day.</p>
      <p>Third-place Atalanta face in-form Cagliari on Sunday. Roma, in fourth, open the weekend against Napoli.</p>
      <p>The top two flip-flopped in midweek. Inter won 2-1 at Brescia on Tuesday. Juventus, playing with 10 men, regained a one-point lead when Cristiano Ronaldo converted a 90th-minute penalty at home to Genoa on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>After the victory at Brescia, Inter manager Antonio Conte, always a glass-half-empty type, complained that his squad is being asked to do too much.</p>
      <p>“It becomes difficult to talk about the game because we’ve now played our fourth match in nine days with the same players,” he said.</p>
      <p>“We now have to recover because we’re only halfway there, I haven’t seen any other side having to play seven matches in 20 days. Next up it’s Bologna on Saturday and then we’ve got a Tuesday fixture away to Dortmund.”</p>
      <p>Conte reportedly had meetings with Inter management this week to discuss adding one or two midfielders in the winter transfer period.</p>

      <p>“We are pushing the engine to the max,” he said.</p>
      <p>Most of his players had got the message.</p>
      <p>“We’re playing every three days and it isn’t easy. There is slight fatigue,” said Argentine striker Lautaro Martinez, who scored Inter’s opening goal in Tuesday, his fifth of the season.</p>
      <p>There was one dissenting voice.</p>
      <p>“It’s nice to play every few days,” said Dutch defender Matthijs de Ligt. “We footballers live to play games. It’s tiring but we’re happy.”</p>
      <p>Bologna are anchored in mid-table after losing 3-2 away to Cagliari on Wednesday but defender Stefano Denswil promised Inter a tough match.</p>
      <p>“We want to play a great game against Inter in front of our fans,” the Dutchman said.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile Juventus’s weekend opponents are in some disarray. Walter Mazzarri, the Torino manager, received the dreaded vote of confidence ahead of the Turin derby.</p>
      <p>Torino lost 4-0 at Lazio on Wednesday, although all the goals came after defender Nicolas Nkoulou received a second yellow card after 21 minutes.</p>
      <p>Torino president Urbano Cairo was not happy.</p>
      <p>“We have a derby ahead of us but above all a long championship ahead of us: I think it’s right today to examine everyone’s conscience.”</p>
      <p>He added that he had confidence in Mazzarri.</p>
      <p>“I confirm my faith in Mazzarri,” said Cairo. “He’s not under examination.”</p>
      <p>The last thing the former Napoli, Inter and Watford manager needs is Torino’s habitual defeat in the Derby della Mole.</p>
      <p>Torino have only beaten Juventus once in 28 league meetings since 1995. In that time, Juve, despite being briefly relegated, have won 12 Scudetti and a European title. Torino have won a second division title.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Key stats</b>
      </p>
      <p>12: Lazio’s Ciro Immobile has scored 12 goals — four of them penalties — in the first 10 games. The last player to start so fast? Immobile, when he hit 12 in 10 in 2017-18.</p>

      <p>513: On Tuesday, goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon tied with Alessandro del Piero for most Juventus appearances. If he plays on Saturday he will be alone on 514.</p>
      <p>13: Inter have scored in their first 13 matches under Conte. No other Inter coach has managed that.</p>
