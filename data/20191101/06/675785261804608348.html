      <p>A three-year-old girl has been hospitalised after taking prescription drugs she found in her bucket of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/halloween">Halloween</a> sweets.</p>
      <p>Abby Van Der Spuy suddenly became ill while out trick-or-treating with her mum in the suburbs of Melbourne, Australia.</p>
      <p>Abby's mum Tara told the Herald Sun she suddenly noticed her daughter was "zonked and wobbly on her feet".</p>
      <p>It's believed Abby swallowed a drug called Seroquel, which is used to treat depression and bipolar disorder.</p>

      <p>According to local media reports, the little girl found the medicine in a zip-locked bag amongst the sweets in her bucket of treats.</p>
      <p>Two neighbours quickly called emergency services just after 8pm.</p>
      <p>Paramedics rushed to the scene and "were urgent about getting her to hospital".</p>
