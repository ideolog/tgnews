      <h3>A Scary Long Impeachment</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/31/us/politics/house-impeachment-vote.html?module=inline">House Democrats voted on Thursday to approve a resolution</a> setting out rules for an impeachment inquiry into President Trump. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/31/us/politics/house-impeachment-vote.html?module=inline">Republicans resoundingly voted against it</a>.</p>
      <blockquote>“Today is Halloween, and the House of Representatives passed a resolution that formalized the impeachment inquiry into President Trump. In other words: Boo.” <i>— SETH MEYERS<br/></i><br/><br/>“Minutes after the House voted to start the investigation, the White House denounced the process as, ‘a blatantly partisan attempt to destroy the president.’ And then Democrats were like, ‘Yeah, pretty much.’” <i>— JAMES CORDEN</i></blockquote>

      <blockquote>“We’re one step closer to getting Trump out of the White House and sending him home to New York City — oh. Quick! Quick! Somebody lock the Lincoln Tunnel and turn out the lights. Everybody on the floor. We’re not home!” <i>— STEPHEN COLBERT</i><br/><br/><br/>“Now, before you get too excited, please remember that this is just a vote to define the rules for the process of impeachment, all right? They still have to vote on impeachment. Then they vote on the rules for the impeachment trial. Then they vote on whether or not to convict. Yeah, by the time this is over, the Democrats are going to march into the White House, like, ‘Mr. Trump? Wait, where’s Trump? What happened?’ And the woman will be like ‘His term ended 20 years ago.’ ‘Oh, we’re so sorry to bother you, President Kim Kardashian.’” <i>— TREVOR NOAH<br/></i><br/><br/>“Seriously, there’s like so many steps before you can actually punish an American president. Congress impeaches presidents like white parents discipline their kids: ‘Young man, if you don’t listen, I’m going to tell you again. And then if you don’t, I’m going to talk to your father and then we’re going to talk with our therapist.’” <i>— TREVOR NOAH<br/></i><br/><br/>“The House voted today to formalize the impeachment process, which means — I don’t know what it means. It means it’ll go to the Senate. Republicans in the Senate will do nothing about it, and Trump will say he won is probably what it means.” <i>— JIMMY KIMMEL<br/></i><br/><br/>“Quick follow up: The Titanic just hit an iceberg. The captain is saying ‘It was a perfect iceberg; now we can all make Slurpees for everyone,’ and he’s asking you to handcuff yourself to the port-side rail and swallow the keys. Are you all willing to do that?” <i>— STEPHEN COLBERT</i></blockquote>

      <blockquote>“Then later in the morning, Trump tweeted again, this time even more desperate and trying out an even dumber argument. He tweeted: ‘The impeachment hoax is hurting our stock market. The Do Nothing Democrats don’t care.’ That has nothing to do with impeachment. There’s no secret footnote in the Constitution that says ‘the president shall be removed from office for treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors unless it’s bad for the stock market in which case, cool it.’” <i>— SETH MEYERS</i></blockquote>
      <h3>The Punchiest Punchlines (Big Fan Edition)</h3>
      <p>A Washington Nationals fan celebrating the team’s World Series win went viral after sharing his feelings on Trump, during an expletive-laden television news interview on Wednesday night.</p>
      <blockquote>“What did this reporter think was going to happen? She’s interviewing drunk fans. Did she expect a cogent response?<i> [As drunk fan] </i>‘While I’m happy, this victory is somewhat tarnished by the cloud of impeachment hanging over this great nation. If we accept the lowering of constitutional standards, America will cease to be a shining beacon of liberty. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have to go puke into a storm drain! Go Nats!” <i>— STEPHEN COLBERT<br/></i><br/><br/>“He’s not wrong. Also shout out to the producer who was like ‘Yeah, we’re going live to a bar right after the World Series game.’” <i>— DESUS NICE<br/></i><br/><br/>“Save that language for CNN, young man.” <i>— JIMMY KIMMEL<br/></i><br/><br/>“D.C. is so political that even the drunk sports fans get involved as well. Like I wonder if there’s bar fights in D.C. where it’s like, ‘You stepped on my sneaker — I’m going to beat you like Brown vs. the Board of Education, man.’”<i> — TREVOR NOAH</i></blockquote>
