      <p>Washington - <b>Scottie Scheffler</b> bogeyed his final hole but still emerged with a one-stroke lead on nine-under par 62 on Thursday after the first round of the PGA Tour's <b>Bermuda Championship</b>.</p>
      <p>Scheffler, the 2019 Korn Ferry Tour Player of the Year, teed off on the 10th hole at Port Royal Golf Club in Southampton and played his first nine holes in six-under.</p>
      <p>That included an eagle at the par-five 17th. Four more birdies after the turn, including back-to-back birdies at six and seven, Scheffler had a shot at a 59, but he parred the eighth before surrendering a stroke at nine.</p>
      <p>"You think about it a little bit," Scheffler said of a chance to break 60.</p>
      <p>"The eagle putt on seven was pretty close and then on eight, felt like I hit a pretty good putt, just misread it ... kind of lost a little momentum."</p>
      <p>Scheffler, 23, won twice on the developmental Korn Ferry Tour in 2019 and tied for seventh in his first PGA Tour start of the season.</p>
      <p>He had a one-shot lead over compatriot Wes Roach, who had eight birdies and an eagle at the par-five seventh along with two bogeys in a 63.</p>
      <p>Scotland Russell Knox was tied for third on 64 with Rob Oppenheim and Bo Hoag, with Australian veteran John Senden a further stroke back on 65.</p>
      <p>Oppenheim birdied seven of the first eight holes, but parred all of his remaining holes in a seven-under effort.</p>
      <p>Like Oppenheim, Knox was among the four players to post a round without a bogey, jump starting his day with four straight birdies from the second through the fifth holes.</p>
      <p>This year marks the inaugural edition of the US tour's first tournament in Bermuda. It's being played opposite the WGC-HSBC Champions in Shanghai.</p>
