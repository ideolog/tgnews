      <h1>James Forrest the ultimate Celtic throwback as humble hero joins list of Hoops' greatest icons</h1>
      <h2>Celtic winger has eclipsed some of the most famous names in the club's history with his incredible career stats.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T06:00:00+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Michael Gannon, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/michael-gannon/</a></address>
      <p>These days players are all over Instagram if they take a half-decent throw-in.</p>
      <p>But <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/james-forrest">James Forrest</a> is the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> 21st century icon who doesn’t even have a profile pic.</p>
      <p>The Hoops winger is happy to be a humble hero and he doesn’t bother himself with the silly stuff like social media.</p>
      <p>It’s a shame mind you. If he did he would have seen the astonishing lists of his career statistics doing the rounds that put him up alongside the Parkhead greats.</p>
      <p>In a week where he penned a new Celtic deal the incredible numbers went viral.</p>

      <p>Forrest now has the record number of assists for the club since the Millennium, with the 84 goals he’s set up surpassing stars such as Alan Thompson and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/henrik-larsson">Henrik Larsson</a>.</p>
      <p>The medal haul of 17 honours has him with only team-mate Scott Brown, Bobby Lennox, Billy McNeill, Jimmy Johnstone, Bobby Murdoch, Alec McNair and Jimmy McMenemy ahead of him in the all-time major silverware stakes.</p>
      <p>If all those dizzying figures weren’t enough boss <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/neil-lennon">Neil Lennon</a> set the internet ablaze with another one after his goalscoring performance in the 2-0 win against St Mirren on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The gaffer said Forrest was worth £25million following yet another impressive display.</p>
      <p>The 28-year-old could have dipped online to see some of the love but it’s not this lad’s style.</p>
      <p>Forrest said: “The boys joke about it but no, I don’t have Twitter or Instagram. My uncle sends me some of the good stuff but not the bad stuff!</p>
      <p>“It does make you feel good. There are a few who aren’t on it but most people are these days. It’s just not for me.</p>

      <p>“I keep myself away from that. I always want to think of the next game and then add to it.</p>
      <p>“It’s great to hear. It’s good and I do get a buzz off it but you need to stay grounded. The staff are good at keeping the boys humble. Maybe once I finish I’ll look back at things like that and realise what I had.</p>
      <p>“But for now I want to keep working hard and get as much as I can get.”</p>
      <p>Forrest takes the £25m price tag in his stride like it’s a full-back in his slipstream and despite the avalanche of plaudits he still won’t rest on his laurels.</p>
      <p>He added: “It’s nice to hear good things. The manager is good that way.</p>
      <p>“There have been a few different managers over the years and so many different players in my position and good players too, so the competition for places has definitely helped me to keep going.</p>
      <p>“Even though I’ve signed that deal I’m not going to think that’s me here for the next four years. I know I need to work hard at it and it’s so enjoyable to play in this team just now.”</p>

      <p>Celtic fans are so used to Forrest doing the business on a weekly basis they’re almost guilty of taking him for granted. But finally the word is getting around and the songs are coming from the stands.</p>
      <p>The Scotland star shrugged sheepishly again and said: “I have heard a couple of them and it was good to hear.</p>
      <p>“I must be doing something right so I just want to keep it going.</p>
      <p>“No, I’m not embarrassed because it’s good but I’m just not one for social media or being out there.</p>
      <p>“When you play for a club like Celtic it’s worldwide and I think over the years I’ve never taken it for granted how big the club is.</p>
      <p>“I’m delighted with the way things are going but I just want to make sure it continues.</p>
      <p>“That’s the pressure of playing for Celtic and that’s what keeps the players and the staff on their toes.</p>
      <p>“You know that if you don’t have a good game there’s a big squad to deal with it and someone to come in.”</p>

      <p>All this fuss is making Parkhead’s quiet man blush, especially when he hears he is on track for another incredible record this season.</p>
      <p>Forrest has scored in three League Cup finals in a row – to match a feat achieved by the legendary Bobby Lennox – with Hibs blocking the path in the semis this weekend and the chance to make it four.</p>
      <p>He said: “We’ve had goodperformances and good results at Hampden so we’re going in there with a lot of confidence.</p>
      <p>“If you win the three games last week then you don’t come away with three points against St Mirren it doesn’t mean as much so it’s good that you follow up a good result with another one.</p>
      <p>“With Celtic there are so many big games. We have a semi-final on Saturday and then a Europa League game on Thursday and we know we can’t afford to slip up in the league either.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“That’s good and you want to be involved in the big games and contribute. Hopefully I can do that on Saturday.”</p>
      <p>Forrest mentioned Europe but Lennon won’t let his squad’s thoughts wander to Rome.</p>
      <p>The winger said: “I don’t think the manager will let us think about Lazio. Hibs is the big one for us now and we all know it is a great day if we go to Hampden for a final so that’s what we want to do.</p>
      <p>“Everyone’s looking forward to it. We won’t write Hibs off because we’ve had tough games against them.</p>
      <p>“We know it will be a hard game and we’re going to need to play at our best if we want to get to the Final.”</p>
