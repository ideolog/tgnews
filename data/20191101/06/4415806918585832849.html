      <h1>Law to help families of missing people comes into effect</h1>

      <p>Families of people who are missing and presumed dead will no longer face the “hurt and pain” of waiting over seven years to manage their affairs as a new law comes into effect.</p>
      <p>Under the new legislation families will be able to apply to the courts for a presumption of death order, where a death certificate can be issued.</p>
      <p>The previous law stated that a person cannot be declared dead until they have been missing for seven years.</p>
      <p>It left families unable to access their loved one’s estate or drawn down on insurance or mortgage protection.</p>
      <p>Senator Colm Burke, who introduced the Civil Law (Presumption of Death) Bill, said the previous law made it “extremely difficult” for families to obtain a death certificate.</p>
      <blockquote>The immediate effect of a loved one going missing is panic</blockquote>
      <p>He explained that under the new law, which comes into effect today (Friday), a presumption of death order is granted when the court is satisfied that the circumstances in which a person went missing indicates their death is virtually certain or the length of disappearance shows it is highly likely the person is dead.</p>
      <p>Mr Burke said said this is “extremely important” for families as it allows the missing person’s loved ones to try and move on and manage the person’s affairs.</p>
      <p>“Up to now there was no set procedure available dealing with this. This now entitles you to apply to court for the assumption of death certificate,” he added.</p>
      <p>“It’s important for families to have a proper structure in place to deal with issues like this.</p>
      <p>“A process is now in place to allow people to move on. The previous advice was ‘sorry you have to wait seven years’.</p>
      <p>“It could have been simple things like selling the person’s car as you must show documentation you are entitled to sell it.</p>
      <p>“No one thinks about it until they are in that position.”</p>
      <p>There are around 9,000 missing reports filed to the gardaí each year in Ireland and it is believed that many of these are teenagers.</p>
      <p>While most of these people are found, up to 70 cases a year are not resolved.</p>
      <p>Dermot Browne, the chairman of the National Missing Persons Helpline, believes there are more than 400 missing people cases that have not been concluded.</p>
      <p>Mr Browne, who has been chairman of the organisation for 11 years, said the new legislation will make a huge difference to families who are forced to wait years to obtain a death certificate.</p>
      <p>“It takes away half of the hurt and pain that families go through as at least this is one area that they don’t have to go through,” he said.</p>
      <p>“In a family where a husband is the breadwinner and he has gone missing, there are ramifications for the family both emotionally and practically because there is no money coming in.</p>
      <p>“The family can’t draw down on insurance or mortgage protection. But now there is a clear path to getting the presumption of death order.</p>
      <p>“It will make a huge difference to a small amount of families.</p>
      <p>“The immediate effect of a loved one going missing is panic. No one can ever prepare for a loved one going missing.</p>
      <p>“Families then go through despair, guilt and they blame others and themselves.</p>
      <p>“We try and help people through those stages.”</p>
