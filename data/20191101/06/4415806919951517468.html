      <p>Pop star Lizzo “won Halloween” after referencing one of her hit songs for a costume.</p>
      <p>The US singer, 31, dressed up as a DNA test – complete with swab – in a reference to her chart-topping single Truth Hurts.</p>
      <p>She revealed the outfit in a video posted to Instagram. It begins with a friend answering a knock at the door, declaring “finally, my DNA test came in”.</p>

      <p>Then, the opening bars of Truth Hurts chime in and Lizzo appears in the doorway wearing a white board with the words “DNA test” written on it in sparkling letters.</p>
      <p>The front of the outfit opens to reveal the “results” – “100% that bitch”.</p>
      <p>Her single Truth Hurts contains the DNA test line. It was inspired by a meme created by singer Mina Lioness.</p>
      <p>One fan on Twitter told Lizzo: “You won Halloween.”</p>
      <p>Truth Hurts was originally released in 2017 but became a viral hit earlier this year after gaining popularity on the video sharing website TikTok.</p>
      <p>It topped the charts in the US and has become the the longest-running Billboard Hot 100 number one by a solo female rapper.</p>
      <p>Detroit-born Lizzo, whose real name is Melissa Vivianne Jefferson, has enjoyed a stellar year following the April release of her third studio album, Cuz I Love You.</p>
      <p>She is also an actress and appeared in the drama Hustlers alongside Constance Wu and Jennifer Lopez.</p>
