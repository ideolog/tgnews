      <p>Everyone’s favorite secret-not-so-secret hobby of eating raw cookie dough just got even more dangerous—on top of, you know, the whole salmonella thing. Nestlé USA is recalling a slew of its refrigerated ready-to-bake cookie-dough products after rubber was found in some packages.</p>
      <p>Importantly, there have been no reported illnesses or injuries, so it’s not totally clear how Nestlé came to realize it was selling ready-to-bake rubber chip cookies. Furthermore, <a href="https://fox8.com/2019/11/01/nestle-recalls-ready-to-bake-refrigerated-cookie-dough-after-rubber-found-in-products/"><u>as Fox 8 in Cleveland reports</u></a>, this is a voluntary recall, meaning the company is taking responsibility and jumping into action to get any possibly affected items off shelves.</p>
      <p>“Nestlé USA is taking this action out of an abundance of caution after receiving reports of food-grade pieces of rubber in some of these products,” the company said in a statement, <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/nestle-cookie-dough-recall-rubber-pieces-ready-bake-1469117"><u>according to <i>Newsweek</i></u></a>. “We have identified the source of the rubber and have already fixed the issue.”</p>
      <p>To figure out if you’ve got one of these products in your fridge, check to see if your Nestlé ready-to-bake item has a batch code that begins with numbers between 9189 and 9295. Newsweek has a tip if you don’t know where to look for a batch code: It can be found after the “use or freeze by” date and before the number “5753.”</p>
