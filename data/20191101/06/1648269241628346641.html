      <h1>Porsche 944 Rendering Explores Hypothetical Return</h1>
      <h2>A modern-day front-engine Porsche sports car, anyone?</h2>

      <p>A front-engine, rear-wheel-drive <a href="https://www.motor1.com/porsche/">Porsche</a>? That might sound like something we are not going to see anytime soon from the German company but back in the 1980s and 1990s, the <a href="https://www.motor1.com/tag/porsche-944/">944</a> played exactly that role. An alternative to the <a href="https://www.motor1.com/porsche/911/">911</a> with the engine mounted at the front – and honestly, it’s a car we totally adore.</p>
      <p>With Porsche’s current plan of <a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/376144/2020-porsche-taycan-4s-official-debut/">embracing the electrification</a>, we find it virtually impossible to see a new front-engine sports model in production. Not only that, but the automaker now has two sports series, the 911 and Boxster/Cayman, which leave no room for yet another sports car. But hey, that doesn’t mean we can dream, right?</p>
      <p>That’s probably what <a href="https://www.motor1.com/tag/thesketchmonkey/"><i>TheSketchMonkey</i></a> thought when starting his work on the 944 in an attempt to modernize the vehicle for the 21<sup>st</sup> century. Obviously, keeping the proportions and packaging of the original car was crucial for this project and that’s exactly what the digital manipulator did.</p>

      <p>Working on the rear three-quarter angle of the car, he proposes a more minimalistic approach to the design of the 944 with fewer accents at the back and somewhat more restrained sidelines. In contrast, the rear bumper diffuser adds a huge dose of aggression, while the taillights with a LED connecting strip makes the car look visually wider.</p>
      <p>We are not here to judge, of course, but in our eyes, the diffuser is a bit too much. See, the problem’s not that it’s too aggressive, but that it doesn’t have any style connection with the original panel that it replaces. The headlights do a great job of modernizing the rear of the car through, and the new wheels are a fantastic final touch.</p>
      <p>What do you think – would a modernized 944 work for Porsche in 2019? Let us know in the comment section below.</p>
