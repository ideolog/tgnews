      <p>The US State Department told Congress that the White House budget office and National Security Council had decided to withhold the foreign military assistance, Reuters reported, citing the two officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.</p>
      <p>The decision comes just two days after Prime Minister Saad Hariri announced his resignation amid continuing mass protests in Lebanon.</p>
      <p>Earlier, Hariri <a href="https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/201910311077185279-lebanons-hariri-calls-on-supporters-to-refrain-from-holding-protests-after-his-departure/">called on the supporters</a> of his Future Movement party to refrain from holding demonstrations and to work together with the military and security forces. He announced his resignation late on Tuesday, which prompted a stop in the mass protests that rocked Lebanon.</p>
