      <p>REUTERS: Granada missed a chance to extend their fairytale start to the season and return to the top of La Liga on Thursday as they fell to a 3-1 defeat at Getafe.</p>
      <p>The home side went ahead in the 35th minute with a sweeping strike from striker Angel Rodriguez after Granada had given the ball away in midfield.</p>

      <p>They doubled their lead six minutes later when Mauro Arambarri headed home from a corner as Granada goalkeeper Rui Silva miscalculated when he tried to claim the cross into the box.</p>
      <p>Granada winger Antonio Puertas gave the visitors a fighting chance of salvaging a point when he netted on the rebound from close range in the 74th minute but David Timor sealed victory for Getafe in the 88th by hammering a free kick in off the bar.</p>
      <p>Granada had climbed to the top of the standings on Sunday after beating Real Betis 1-0 but they are now third on 20 points from 11 games, one point behind second-placed Real Madrid and two adrift of leaders Barcelona, who both have a game in hand.</p>
      <p>Getafe moved up to ninth with 16 points.</p>
