      <p>UFC fighter Conor McGregor is due to appear in court this morning in connection with an alleged incident at a pub in Dublin.</p>
      <p>The mixed martial arts star is facing a single charge of assault.</p>
      <p>Dublin District Court previously heard that the 31-year-old, of Lady Castle, Straffan, Co Kildare, is accused of assaulting Desmond Keogh at the Marble Arch pub in Drimnagh on April 6, where McGregor was promoting his brand of whiskey.</p>
      <p>CCTV footage from the night emerged last August and had been widely shared on social media.</p>
      <p>The judge remanded McGregor on continuing bail at his last hearing and he is expected to either make a plea or contest the charge when he returns to court later today.</p>
