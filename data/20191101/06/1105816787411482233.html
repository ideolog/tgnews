      <h1>Jennifer Aniston teases the 'Friends' cast is 'working on something' together</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T06:20:05+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 06:20</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/5607/entertainment-desk/" target="_blank">Entertainment Desk</a></address>
      <p>Jennifer Aniston has hinted at a mystery project that she and the rest of the <i>Friends</i> cast are apparently working on. She kept saying that “something is happening” in an attempt to avoid further grilling on what that may be.</p>
      <p>The 50-year-old actor had been speaking on <i>The Late Show with Stephen Colbert</i> on Tuesday evening, reported <i>Daily Mail</i>.</p>

      <p>Aniston was questioned why she had teased fans with news of the potential project on <i>The Ellen DeGeneres</i> show earlier. She admitted that there is indeed something coming in the future, except she just doesn’t know what it is yet.</p>
      <p>“I make noises,” she said playfully. “I just make noises. Just like that. I said, ‘Something is happening.’ I don’t know what something, but I just said, ‘It’s happening.’ Something <i>is</i> happening.”</p>
      <p>“So you can confirm that something is happening?” Colbert queried, to which the actor replied, “Something is happening. But we don’t know what that something is.”</p>
      <p>“Doesn’t matter,” Stephen noted. “Something is better than nothing.”</p>

      <p>Interestingly, the rest of the <i>Friends</i> cast and creators have been adamant about the fact that they’re not remaking the super hit 90s sitcom. But when DeGeneres asked about it, Aniston had said, “Like a reboot of the show? No. Listen, we would love for there to be something, but we don’t know what that something is. So we’re just trying. We’re working on something.”</p>
      <p><i>Friends</i> aired from 1994 until 2004, starring Aniston as Rachel Green, Courteney Cox as Monica Geller, Matthew Perry as Chandler Bing, David Schwimmer as Ross Geller, Matt LeBlanc as Joey Tribbiani and Lisa Kudrow as Phoebe Buffay.</p>
