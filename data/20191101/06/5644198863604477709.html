      <p>AC Milan avoided a Halloween scare by beating lowly Serie A rivals SPAL 1-0 at San Siro on Thursday to give coach Stefano Pioli his first win since replacing the sacked Marco Giampaolo.</p>
      <p>MILAN: AC Milan avoided a Halloween scare by beating lowly Serie A rivals SPAL 1-0 at San Siro on Thursday to give coach Stefano Pioli his first win since replacing the sacked Marco Giampaolo.</p>
      <p>The victory lifted Milan into the top 10 with 13 points from 10 games while Ferrara-based SPAL, who have only beaten Milan once away from home, remained second-bottom with seven.</p>

      <p>After a first half short on incident, winger Suso came on in the 57th and scored six minutes later with a free kick on the edge of the area after Krzysztof Piatek was brought down.</p>
      <p>Milan defender Theo Hernandez had earlier netted off a pass from Lucas Paqueta in the 47th but it was ruled offside.</p>
      <p>Paqueta came close in the 79th when he was thwarted at close range by SPAL's Albania goalkeeper Etrit Berisha.</p>
      <p>Pioli had collected one point from his first two games after replacing Giampaolo on Oct. 9 and made four changes from the side that lost 2-1 to AS Roma at the Stadio Olimpico on Sunday.</p>
