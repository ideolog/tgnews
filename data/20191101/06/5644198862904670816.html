      <p>LOS ANGELES: Firefighters battled several active wildfires on Thursday (Oct 31) in California appearing to make headway against a number of major blazes that have forced mass evacuations and power cuts.</p>
      <p>Two fast-moving infernos broke out early on Thursday in the southern part of the state, burning several homes and forcing people to flee.</p>

      <p>One - the Hillside Fire - was in San Bernardino, some 100 kilometres east of Los Angeles, while the other - the 46 Fire - was in neighbouring Riverside County.</p>
      <p>Hundreds of firefighters backed by water-dropping helicopters were attacking the infernos driven by record so-called Santa Ana winds that have prompted unprecedented warnings of "extremely critical" fire risk - the most severe category.</p>
      <p>"I was asleep and woke up at 2.00am to a strong smell of smoke," recalled Matthew Valdivia, 35, as he stood in front of the remains of his home destroyed by the blaze in San Bernardino.</p>
      <p>Valdivia told AFP he and his wife quickly woke their four kids up and alerted neighbors as the flames closed in.</p>
      <p>"It's devastating," he said. "This was our first home ... I worked 72 hours a week just to live the American dream."</p>
      <p>The National Weather Service said although the red flag warnings would remain in effect through Thursday for much of Los Angeles and Ventura counties, conditions had improved.</p>
      <p>"Winds are somewhat lighter today over most areas, which is good news for our firefighters," it said.</p>
      <p>In northern California, firefighters reported making significant progress against the massive Kincade Fire, which erupted Oct 23 and has ravaged the Sonoma County wine region.</p>
      <p>The blaze, the biggest this season, has destroyed nearly 300 homes and other properties, including several wineries, and burned nearly 31,000 hectares. It was 60 per cent contained on Thursday.</p>
      <p>A mandatory evacuation order was lifted allowing tens of thousands of residents to return to their homes.</p>
      <p>
        <b>'A LOT OF THREATS'</b>
      </p>
      <p>Fire crews meanwhile continued to battle a blaze in the Simi Valley, northwest of Los Angeles, where a fire broke out on Wednesday and came dangerously close to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library.</p>
      <p>About 30,000 people were forced to evacuate as the flames raged into the night, fueled by wind gusts of up to 70 miles per hour.</p>
      <p>The winds were powerful enough to overturn some trucks on a nearby highway.</p>
      <p>More than 700 firefighters were battling the blaze known as the Easy Fire, backed by helicopters and aircraft dumping water and fire retardant.</p>
      <p>"We are still not through this," Ventura County Fire Chief Mark Lorenzen told reporters late Wednesday. "We have another 24 hours of significant weather conditions, and a lot of threats."</p>
      <p>It was unclear what started the fire but Southern California Edison said it began near one of its power lines which had not been cut off.</p>
      <p>The utility, as well as other power companies throughout the state, has been shutting off power to hundreds of thousands of customers in a bid to lower the fire risk.</p>
      <p>The Ventura County Fire Department said the Easy Fire has burned 1,723 acres and has been 10 per cent contained as of Thursday morning.</p>
      <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has declared a statewide emergency because of the fires and secured federal funding to assist agencies responding to the fires.</p>
      <p>The blazes come as California is still reeling from the aftermath of the most destructive wildfire in state history - the Camp Fire, which destroyed the town of Paradise and killed 86 people last year.</p>
      <p>Similar blazes in northern California, including in the Napa and Sonoma wine regions, killed 44 people in 2017 and destroyed thousands of structures.</p>
      <p>Remarkably, there have been no fatalities linked to this year's fires.</p>
