      <p>A seven-year-old girl is in a critical condition after being shot in the chest while trick-or-treating.</p>
      <p>The little girl was out enjoying <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/halloween">Halloween</a> dressed as a bumblebee when she was hit by a stray bullet.</p>
      <p>She was trick-or-treating on the Southwest Side of Chicago at around 5.30pm local time when the gunfire broke out.</p>
      <p>The Chicago Police Department said a group of at least three men opened fire on a 31-year-old man, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/31/us/chicago-shooting-halloween.html?smid=tw-nytimes&amp;smtyp=cur">New York Times</a> reports.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for the fire department said the girl was shot in the upper chest and remains in a critical condition.</p>

      <p>A man in his 30s was also struck on the left hand.</p>
      <p>A witness, Lali Lara, <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/ct-little-village-shooting-20191031-lka6hkboqja7nhgxrljnlzvbqu-story.html">told the Chicago Tribune</a> she heard a man screaming, "My little girl's been shot!"</p>
      <p>However, it's been reported the man and girl were not together.</p>
      <p>Lara told the Tribune she rushed the little girl and her family inside the store, adding "Everybody was in shock.</p>
      <p>“I was pressing on her and calling her name so she won’t close her eyes.</p>
      <p>"She was looking at me, and I was calling her name.</p>
