      <h1>Chile: Death toll in anti-government protests hits 23</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T06:19:35+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 06:19</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/8672/anadolu-agency/" target="_blank">Anadolu Agency</a></address>
      <p><b>BUENOS AIRES: </b>At least 23 people have been killed during protests in Chile against the government’s economic policies.</p>
      <p>In a statement on social media Thursday, the Chilean Prosecutor’s Office said the deaths occurred between Oct 19, when a state of emergency was declared, and Oct 26.</p>
      <p>The statement noted that 16 people lost their lives due to ransom and plundering, five were killed in clashes with security forces and two were killed while in custody.</p>
      <p>The identity of a protestor who was burnt to death has not been determined, but an investigation is underway. The anti-government protests, which began in response to a now-suspended transport fare hike, turned violent on Oct 19.</p>

      <p>During the unrest, 49 subway stations were destroyed and 26 buses were set on fire.</p>
      <p>More than 9,200 people were arrested across the country, according to the Justice Ministry.</p>
      <p>Demonstrators plan to stage more mass protests on the weekend to demand the resignation of President Sebastian Pinera, who replaced eight cabinet members, including his interior and finance ministers.</p>
      <p>On Oct. 18, protesters jumped turnstiles at metro stations in Santiago without paying for tickets in protest against a 4% transport fare hike.</p>
      <p>Pinera also announced concessions, including rolling back the fare increase, an increase in the minimum wage and putting a hike in electricity prices on hold until next year in a bid to contain the strife.</p>
      <p>Half of Chile’s workers make $550 or less monthly, according to the country’s statistics authority.</p>
      <p>Anti-government protests continue across the country, but the participation rate is relatively lower.</p>
