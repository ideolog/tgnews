      <p>Regarding Wonho's allegations of possessing and using the illegal drug marijuana in 2013 before his debut, Starship responded, <i>"It's true that after arriving at the airport in September from MONSTA X's concert in Germany, Wonho underwent a simple liquid and body test; however, the tests proceeded as if they were a part of the airport security check, and so we were not informed otherwise about the specifics of the police investigations. At the time, we had no idea that police were investigation Wonho for allegations of illegal drug use from 2013." </i></p>
      <p>Finally, the label stated, <i>"We feel a heavy weight of responsibility for causing many people concerns due to recent events, and we will do our best to participate in the ongoing investigations diligently.
