      <h1>Daniel James admits he was star-struck meeting Man Utd team-mates and Ryan Giggs</h1>
      <h2>The Wales international joined the Red Devils from Swansea over the summer</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T06:55:32+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 06:55</time> by <a rel="author">Hassan Rashed</a></address>
      <p>Daniel James has admitted he was 'a bit star-struck' when he first met his <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> teammates and Wales boss Ryan Giggs.</p>
      <p>The 21-year-old joined the Red Devils from Championship club Swansea for Â£15million over the summer and has made an impressive start to life at Old Trafford.</p>
      <p>He has also been a regular in the Wales national team under former United legend Ryan Giggs, earning eight caps and finding the net twice.</p>
      <p>And the winger said that he had similar reactions when he first started working with both his international manager and other members of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's squad.</p>
      <p>Asked how he adjusted to working with Giggs, James told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHjUpx8PCws">JD Football's #TalkingTekkers</a> , "At the start you are a bit star-struck. It was the same when I went into United.</p>
      <p>"It was weird being in the changing room at the start because you talk about these players all the time and then you are there.</p>

      <p>"Being a footballer you treat everyone the same. It's the same when people ask you for autographs or pictures and you think you are just a normal person. You can't be too star-struck."</p>
      <p>After three goals in his first four Premier League appearances, James has established himself as a important member of Solskjaer's first team, missing just one game in all competitions.</p>
      <p>And although he has become a regular starter much quicker than many - even himself - expected, James insists his original target of reaching double figures for goals has remained the same.</p>
      <p>"The plan for the season for me was to play as many games as possible," he added.</p>

      <p>"I came to United maybe thinking I could be a fringe player. I wanted to try and get in the team as quick as I could but I thought it may take a bit more time.</p>
      <p>"I got chucked in a lot earlier than I thought. But I was ready for it. I worked hard during the summer. It was about proving people wrong and showing what I can do.</p>
      <p>"But now I have started to play I have to change that. Coming in, I set my goal to get ten goals. I scored three in four and people said to me, 'Are you going to change those goals now?'</p>
      <p>"But I said, 'I haven't reached that yet so I'm not going to change those goals'."</p>
