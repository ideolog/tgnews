      <h1>Sir Alex Ferguson surprises patients and staff at East Kilbride hospice unit</h1>
      <h2>The former Manchester United and Aberdeen boss brightened up the patients' day</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T06:00:00+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Thomson, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/paul-thomson/</a></address>
      <p>Football legend <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/sir-alex-ferguson">Sir Alex Ferguson</a> made a surprise visit to Kilbryde Hospice this week.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/aberdeen-fc">Aberdeen</a> boss dropped by the In-Patient Unit at Hairmyres Hospital on Wednesday afternoon - to the astonishment of patients and staff.</p>
      <p>Sir Alex, who suffered a brain hemorrhage in September last year, showed great compassion as he met with patients and also shared some stories along the way.</p>
      <p>The 77-year-old had an illustrious career in football management, winning two European Cups and 13 league titles with United and guiding the Dons to European Cup Winners' Cup and Super Cup success.</p>
      <p>The man regarded by many as the game's greatest manager also took time out to give a motivational talk to the clinical team at the hospice.</p>
      <p>Govan-born Sir Alex is a high-profile supporter of the hospice due to his long-term friendship with Glasgow businessman James Mortimer, his wife Rena and Lady Susan Haughey.</p>

      <p>The hospice In-Patient Unit is named in honour of Donna Mortimer Ballantyne, who was a director of Kilbryde Hospice before her untimely death due to skin cancer in 2011.  </p>
      <p>Gordon McHugh, chief executive at Kilbryde Hospice, said: "This was a total surprise for us all.</p>
      <p>"Sir Alex has given his time selflessly and the smiles he brought to the patients' faces was just magnificent to see.</p>
      <p>"It has also been a huge boost to all of my team here at Kilbryde."</p>
