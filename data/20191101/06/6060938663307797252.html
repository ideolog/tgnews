      <p>Director Ashutosh Gowariker will be making his comeback with this period drama after his 2016 film 'Mohenjo Daro' starring Hrithik Roshan and Pooja Hegde failed to deliver at the box office. Arjun has put all his effort into the project, from going through heavy workout routines for building his physique and even shaving his head bald.</p>
      <p>Produced by Sunita Gowariker and Rohit Shelatkar, 'Panipat' will hit the screens on December 6 this year. Veteran actress Padmini Kolhapure will also play a pivotal role in the film. Ajay Atul is composing the music for the film and the songs will be written by Javed Akhtar.</p>
