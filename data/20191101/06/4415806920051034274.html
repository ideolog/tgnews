      <p>A seven-year-old girl out trick or treating in a bumblebee outfit has been critically injured after being shot in Chicago.</p>
      <p>The girl, who was shot in the upper chest area, was taken to Stroger Hospital in critical condition, according to Fire Department spokesman Larry Langford.</p>
      <p>A 30-year-old man was shot in the left hand and taken to a nearby hospital in good condition.</p>
      <p>The shooting occurred early Halloween evening as the girl was walking with her family and other trick-or-treaters along a street in the Little Village neighbourhood.</p>

      <p>In a tweet, Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said the girl was believed to be an unintended victim.</p>
      <p>He said members of the community were assisting investigators “but we need more”.</p>
      <p>“We heard the shots… four shots, and I went outside,” said Lali Lara, who works in a nearby mobile phone store, told the Chicago Tribune.</p>
      <p>“The girl’s father was screaming, ‘My little girl’s been shot.'”</p>

      <p>Police said a group of males were chasing another male along the street when someone in the group fired at the intended victim.</p>
      <p>It was not immediately known if the wounded man was with the girl or was the one targeted by the shooters.</p>
      <p>Police say they have no description of the gunman, and no-one has been arrested.</p>
      <p>“This is unacceptable,” said Sergeant Rocco Alioto.</p>
      <p>“A seven-year-old girl that was trick or treating with her family had to get shot because a group of guys want to shoot at another male.”</p>
