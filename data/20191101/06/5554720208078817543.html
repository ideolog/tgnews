      <p>Earlier Kejriwal had blamed the chief ministers of Haryana and Punjab namely Manohar Lal Khattar and Captain Amarinder Singh for forcing farmers in their states to burn their crops. This, according to him, had contributed to the rising level of pollution in Delhi.</p>

      <p>Punjab Chief Minister Singh had lashed out at Kejriwal calling him a liar. “Now that Delhi was reeling under dangerously hazardous levels of pollution, the AAP chief had suddenly decided to turn his attention to the critical issue,” news agency PTI had quoted Singh as saying.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the pollution level in Delhi, which deteriorated to dangerous level post Diwali, continues to wreak havoc with parents demanding the closure of schools for the safety of their children.</p>
