      <h1>Lisa Taddeo: ‘A lot of my lessons in love came from Sex and the City’</h1>
      <h2>‘There’s so much in there that’s real and true’</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T06:00:02+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Olivia Petter</a></address>
      <p>Lisa Taddeo has said she learned a lot about love and relationships from <i>Sex and the City</i>.</p>
      <p>Speaking to<i> The Independent</i>‘s dating and relationships podcast, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/millennial-love">Millennial Love</a>, the bestselling author explained that even though re-watching the hit HBO series today can make it seem outdated, “there’s so much in there that’s so real and true”.</p>
      <p>“Like, ‘he’s just not that into you’. It feels so anti-feminist to say these days,” Ms Taddeo said. </p>
      <p>“Things like that are antiquated but at the same time, there’s a biological reason why that’s true, why older generations have told us that and passed it down.” </p>
      <p>Ms Taddeo was speaking alongside therapist <a href="https://workingonthebody.com/">Sally Baker</a>, who agreed that there’s much to be learned from Carrie Bradshaw and the archetypes represented by her two love interests, Big and Aiden.</p>
      <p>The two characters were largely viewed as opposites, with the former loved for his benevolence while the latter was generally chastised for being egotistical and treating women poorly.</p>
      <p>“I’m married to an Aiden but everything prior to that was a Big,” says Ms Taddeo.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere in the episode, the guests examine Ms Taddeo’s bestselling non-fiction book, <i>Three Women, </i>which was lauded for its astute depiction of female sexuality.</p>
      <p>The book tells the stories of three women, including Maggie Wilken, who claims to have had a relationship with her married high school teacher – he was later acquitted when Maggie took the case to court.</p>
