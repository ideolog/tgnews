      <h1>Trump Should Worry: How Iran Hopes Its Many Missiles Will Help It Win a War</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T06:00:00+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://nationalinterest.org/" target="_blank">Kyle Mizokami</a></address>
      <p><b>Key Point:</b> Iran would use these missiles to hold American forces and bases hostage during a crisis or war.</p>
      <p>Like the rest of the Iranian Armed Forces, the Iranian Air Force was crippled by postrevolution purges. Although numerically and technologically superior to the Iraqi Air Force, Iran was unable to achieve air superiority and unable to accurately strike targets deep within Iraq.</p>
      <p>In response, Iran purchased a number of Soviet R-17 (“Scud B”) short-range ballistic missiles from the Libyan government. These strikes, as well as retaliatory strikes by Iraqi ballistic missiles, constituted the so-called “<a href="http://articles.latimes.com/1988-03-14/news/mn-734_1_iraqi-news-agency">War of the Cities</a>.” The lack of accuracy of the missiles made cities the easiest targets, and both Iranian and Iraqi civilians bore the brunt of the crude missile campaign.</p>
      <p>The wartime need for ballistic missiles, as well as Iran’s historical enmity with Israel, led Iran to develop its own missile industry. The first missiles were copies of existing Scud missiles. The Shahab (“Shooting Star”)-1 missile is based on the Scud-B; the Nuclear Threat Initiative estimates Iran maintains an inventory of two to three hundred missiles. The liquid-fueled Shahab-1 can loft a two-thousand-pound high-explosive or chemical warhead up to 186 miles, but like the original Scud-B, its accuracy is lacking. Just half of the warheads from a Shahab-1 would land within a half mile of the target—the rest landing even farther away. Another version, Shahab-2, has a range of 310 miles. Both versions are likely being phased out in favor of a new generation of solid-fuel rockets.</p>
      <p>A third missile, Shahab-3, is actually a variant of North Korea’s Nodong-1 missile. Also developed from the Scud, the Nodong-1 has its origins in Pyongyang’s desire to hit U.S. bases in Japan from the Korean Peninsula. There are differing claims to the distance the Shahab-3 can deliver payloads. The Nuclear Threat Initiative<a href="http://www.nti.org/learn/countries/iran/delivery-systems/"> states</a> that it has a maximum range of 621 miles, which falls short of the Nodong-1’s range. The Center for Strategic and International Studies<a href="https://missilethreat.csis.org/missile/no-dong/"> states</a> that the Nodong-1 has a range of 932 miles, but credits the Shahab-3 a range of 1,242 miles, a significant improvement.</p>
