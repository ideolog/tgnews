      <h1>Rant and Rave: Reader may have lost rings, but appreciates the help to find them</h1>

      <p><b>RAVE </b>to the Washington State Department of Transportation staff who helped me file a report when I realized I lost my rings at a roadside rest stop along I-90. Your kindness and concern helped more than you know, and I was grateful to hear that a maintenance crew member made a special trip to look for the rings. Sadly, the rings may be lost for good, but you all made a rough time easier for me.</p>
      <p><b>RANT</b> to independent caregivers that soon start drumming the patient’s relatives up for more and more money. Best to deal with agencies. There are real vultures out there.</p>
