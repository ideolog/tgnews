        <i>Citizenship | Equal pay | Steve Bell | Larry the cat | Halloween</i>
      </p>
      <p>Citizenship is thriving in schools across the land (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/27/we-need-to-get-participatory-democracy-back-on-track">Letters</a>, 28 October). The headteacher in our local primary school uses one assembly a week to discuss British values as part of the citizenship curriculum – a Cameron government initiative. And the National Citizen Service – another Cameron initiative – is hugely popular, with increasing numbers of 16- and 17-year-olds spending part of their summer holidays volunteering.<br/><b>Christine </b><b>Raper</b><br/><i>Honnington, </i><i>Shropshire</i></p>
      <p>• Your <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/oct/30/bbc-mounts-defence-in-samira-ahmed-equal-pay-case">report</a> on Samira Ahmed’s equal pay claim (31 October) suggests the BBC thinks it right to pay more for an entertainment presenter dealing with topics in a lighthearted way than for a programme where a journalist deals with them seriously. Surely it should be the other way around?<br/><b>Patrick Wallace</b><br/><i>London</i></p>
      <p>• The Steve Bell cartoon featuring Jo Swinson sitting in the middle of the road waiting to be run over (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/picture/2019/oct/31/steve-bells-if-on-boris-johnsons-reward-for-jo-swinson">If…</a>, G2, 31 October) also implies that if you drive too close to the edge you will end up in the ditch, and that would apply to both of the two main tribes.<br/><b>Peter Baldwin</b><br/><i>North Walsham, Norfolk</i></p>
      <p>• Where is Larry the cat? He has not been seen outside No 10, making his regular TV appearances, for some time now. Has he suffered Boris’s “dead in a ditch” fate? What role has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/sep/02/10-downing-street-gets-new-resident-a-jack-russell-cross-puppy">Dilyn</a> played in all this? I think we should be told – before 12 December.<br/><b>Wolf </b><b>and Linda Gruellich</b><br/><i>Edinburgh</i></p>
      <p>• Unaware until too late that you need to display a pumpkin to have children calling at <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/halloween">Halloween</a> (they came last year), I waited with 38 chocolate bars to see the children’s costumes but had no callers.<br/><b>Helen Evans</b><br/><i>Ruthin, Denbighshire</i></p>
