      <h1>Facebook was also interested in acquiring Fitbit, offering less than Google</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T17:10:51+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 17:10</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5google.com/author/technacity/" target="_blank">Abner Li</a></address>
      <p>Google this morning <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/11/01/google-fitbit-acquisition/">announced</a> that it was acquiring Fitbit for $2.1 billion. Speculation that the company was up for sale <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/09/20/comment-google-buying-fitbit/">started last month</a>, and it’s now emerged that Facebook was also an interested suitor.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/facebook-held-talks-to-buy-fitbit-before-google-struck-deal"><i>The Information</i></a>, Facebook held talks to buy Fitbit. The deal price announced today by Google was $2.1 billion, but the social networking company was interested at around $1 billion, or “roughly half.”</p>
      <p>Currently, Facebook sells the Portal line of video conferencing devices for the home. Form factors include smart displays and a recently announced TV add-on. They also have Oculus virtual reality headsets including the hit <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/05/16/youtube-oculus-quest-vr/">Oculus Quest</a>.</p>
      <p>Longer-term, the company is interested in <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/09/17/report-facebook-smart-glasses/">augmented reality glasses</a> and human-computer interaction technology that interprets brain signals. At the moment, an AR wearable is expected around 2023-2025.</p>
      <p>The possibility of Facebook acquiring Fitbit and this broader push into hardware — which started with ex-Google ATAP head <a href="https://9to5google.com/2016/04/13/atap-facebook-regina-dugan/">Regina Dugan’s Building 8</a> — is driven by CEO Mark Zuckerburg’s desire to “own the next computing platform after smartphones eventually become less relevant,” according to today’s report.</p>
      <p>Fitbit would have been a part of Facebook’s overarching hardware division led by Andrew Bosworth. The most recent acquisition of CTRL-labs cost $750 million, while Oculus was $2 billion in 2012. Facebook acquiring Fitbit would have kickstarted an entrance into wearables and provided a large existing user base of 28 million active users.</p>
