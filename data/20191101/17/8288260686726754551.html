      <p>Tim Hortons has released a full statement after a dramatic blaze outside its premises - sparked by an underground electrical fault.</p>
      <p>Shoppers 'ran screaming' from the coffee shop after the fire and a number of explosions.</p>
      <p>Flames were seen shooting up from the pavement outside the premises, which opened earlier this year.</p>
      <p>A cordon is now in place, with police, fire and ambulance now at the scene.</p>

      <p>“I was first one there. It happened around 4.30pm. There were two or three electrical explosions coming out the drain cover outside Tim Hortons - I saw fire flames sparks coming out of the ground - really terrifying.</p>
      <p>“People inside the store started screaming and running out. It was a good 10 mins before fire engine arrived.</p>
      <p>"Five minutes after the explosion police arrived started moving everyone back and told me I had to leave cab because it was too dangerous.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>West Midlands Fire Service were contacted just after 4.20pm and crews from <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/live-updates-fire-explosions-outside-17187643">Ladywood and Aston</a> are on the scene.</p>
      <p>No one is believed to have been hurt.</p>
      <p>A West Midlands Fire Service spokeswoman said: "We were called to Temple Street at 4.22pm this afternoon. We sent two fire engines from Aston and Ladywood to the scene.</p>
      <p>"There are currently eight firefighters tackling an underground fire. The incident is ongoing."</p>
