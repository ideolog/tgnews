      <p>Paris - <b>Grigor Dimitrov</b> saw off unseeded Chilean Cristian Garin 6-2, 7-5 on Friday to set up a <b>Paris Masters</b> semi-final against either Novak Djokovic or Stefanos Tsitsipas.</p>
      <p>Former world No 3 Dimitrov last reached the semis at a Masters tournament in Monte Carlo in 2018, but has rediscovered his form in recent weeks after heading into the US Open ranked 78th.</p>
      <p>The Bulgarian became the lowest-ranked player to reach a Grand Slam semi-final since 2008 at Flushing Meadows before losing to Daniil Medvedev.</p>
      <p>Dimitrov has now won three consecutive matches in straight sets at Bercy, where he had lost in the third round in each of the previous six years.</p>
      <p>World No 42 Garin, playing in his first Masters quarter-final, served for the second set at 5-4, but the 28-year-old Dimitrov reeled off three straight games to claim an impressive victory.</p>
      <p>He has only won one of nine previous meetings with world No 1 Djokovic, but has never played against Greek star Tsitsipas.</p>
