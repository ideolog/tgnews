      <p>FIREFIGHTERS in Northern Ireland responded to significantly fewer calls on Halloween night this year compared to last.</p>
      <p>Between 6pm on October 31 and 1am today, Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service regional control centre received 77 emergency calls and 51 operational incidents were attended - compared to 127 last year.</p>
      <p>Of these, 10 were bonfire related.</p>
      <p>It was the lowest number of calls on Halloween night since 2013.</p>
      <p>Group Commander, Gerry Lennon, said he was "pleased that it was the lowest number of incidents on Halloween night since 2013".</p>
      <p>However, he revealed there were some safety issues during some call outs.</p>
      <p>"Crews withdrew from three separate incidents for safety reasons as they encountered crowds of youths throwing stones, bottles and fireworks," he said.</p>
      <p>"There were no injuries to our crews".</p>
