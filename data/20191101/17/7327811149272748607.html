      <p>NEW YORK CITY (WABC) -- For ABC News' Amy Robach and her husband, actor Andrew Shue, running a marathon is just the next step in a remarkable journey.</p>
      <p>"This is my very first marathon," Amy said. "And Andrew's never even run a half marathon before. So we've been training together, and it's been an awesome thing."</p>
      <p>"We've run, like, eight half marathons during our training. We have!" said Andrew.</p>
      <p>"I didn't really believe he was going to do it," said Amy. "I was, like, 'Andrew says he's going to run the marathon.' But it wasn't until I actually saw you show up for the training runs that I thought he might actually run this with me."</p>
      <p>Six years ago, Amy received a devastating diagnosis that still serves as a powerful, cautionary tale for other women.</p>
      <p>She was diagnosed with breast cancer after undergoing a mammogram live on Good Morning America.</p>
      <p>"Words I never expected to hear," she said at the time. "I was told I have breast cancer. The whole reason why I walked into that van was to raise awareness for people to get mammograms. And little did I know that I'd be a walking example of how having a mammogram saved my life."</p>
      <p>A mastectomy, chemotherapy and reconstructive surgery were all part of Amy's long road to recovery.</p>
      <p>"It changed everything about who I was and what was important to me. And so every year when that date comes around... it could be a dark day, a day of absolute devastation for me. I've turned it into a celebration because I'm still here! And I'm healthy!"</p>
      <p>"And so last year we climbed Kilimanjaro to honor that milestone," she continued. "As a family, actually. And so this year we're running the New York City Marathon."</p>
      <p>Now a cancer survivor, Amy is thriving - not in spite of her disease, but because of it.</p>
      <p>"I am the strongest I have ever been in my life at the age of 46, and I'm really proud of that," she said. "And I honestly have cancer to thank for it."</p>
