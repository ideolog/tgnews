      <h1>'It would break my heart if Wales went back into the doldrums'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T17:05:41+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 17:05</time> by <a rel="author">Online Editors</a></address>
      <p>Warren Gatland says it would break his heart if Welsh rugby ever returned to the doldrums. Gatland’s twelve-year reign as <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/wales">Wales</a> coach ended with a 40-17 defeat in the World Cup bronze-medal match against <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/new-zealand">New Zealand</a> at Tokyo Stadium.</p>
      <p>Wales won four <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations">Six Nations</a> titles, three Grand Slams, reached two World Cup semi-finals and were briefly world-ranked No1 team under his direction. Gatland’s assistants Shaun Edwards and Robin McBryde are also leaving their posts, with a new coaching team headed by Wayne Pivac taking over this month.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.rugbyworldcup.com/news/531603">When Gatland was appointed in late 2007</a>, Wales had earlier crashed out of that year’s World Cup at the pool stage following a horror defeat by <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/fiji">Fiji</a> in Nantes.</p>
      <p>“I really hope for what we’ve achieved in the last 10-12 years, and we feel we’ve earned respect and put respect back into Wales as an international team, that the new coaches coming in continue to build on that,” Gatland said.</p>
      <p>“Because what we have done, what we have achieved, it would break my heart if Wales went back into the doldrums. I just want them to continue. There’s an opportunity for the new group to come in and build on what we’ve created and to improve on it.</p>

      <p>“It’s not to be too greedy on winning the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations">Six Nations</a> every year, but going out there and performing well in the Six Nations. And to continue to hopefully get a few <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations">Six Nations</a> titles over the way and make sure we are as competitive as we can possibly be against the other top nations.</p>
      <p>“We feel we have done that, and I really want Wales to continue to build on that. <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/news/wales-player-ratings-vs-new-zealand">I want to see these boys be as successful as they possibly can</a>.”</p>
      <p>There was no fairytale finish for Gatland as the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/new-zealand">All Blacks</a> ran in six tries, although Wales replied with touchdowns for wing <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/worcester/players/josh-adams/">Josh Adams</a> and full-back Hallam Amos. Adams’ score took him to seven touchdowns for the tournament, breaking Shane Williams’ Welsh record for one World Cup in 2007.</p>

      <p>Gatland, who will coach the Barbarians against Wales in Cardiff later this month, added: “I had already gone through that process of knowing it was my last game and not trying to get too emotional about it.</p>
      <p>“I had come to a realisation about it a long time ago. It’s something I had prepared myself for and (to) start thinking about the next challenges in life.</p>
      <p>“There will be a good crowd there (for the Barbarians game) and hopefully it gives me a chance to say thank you to the Welsh public and fans and express my sincere thanks in terms of on how much I’ve enjoyed these last 12 years.</p>

      <p>“If you ask them (Wales players) to run through a brick wall, the next question is ‘what do you want me to do when I get to the other side?'”</p>
      <p>New Zealand head coach Steve Hansen, who also steps down after the World Cup, said: “We (Hansen and Gatland) have played 10 times, I think, and it might be eight wins (to New Zealand), one loss, one draw. It’s been competitive, yeah. He’s coaching a team, Wales, I once coached, and he has done a wonderful job.</p>
      <p>“Having him back in New Zealand (at the Chiefs) for a year, I’m not sure how that is going to work because he’s going to do the (British and Irish) Lions after that, so not a lot of continuity for him or the Chiefs, but I am sure he’ll work his way through that.”</p>
