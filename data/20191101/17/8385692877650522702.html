      <p>PlayStation Vue is closing down.</p>
      <p>The service will soon stop accepting new subscribers soon.</p>
      <p>Sony has confirmed PlayStation Vue will end operations completely on January 30, 2020.</p>

      <h3>The end of PlayStation Vue</h3>
      <p>For the past few months there had been much speculation about the future of <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2019/07/playstation-vue-live-tv-2019-price-increase.html">PlayStation Vue</a>. That speculation ended a couple of days ago when Sony confirmed it was shutting Vue down.</p>
      <p>In the announcement Sony confirmed the reason was the slow change of the "<i>highly competitive Pay TV industry</i>." Adding that the company plans to focus on "<i>our core gaming business</i>" going forward.</p>
      <p>Sony has confirmed the final end date for PlayStation Vue is January 30, 2020.</p>

      <p>Existing subscribers will be billed for the last time in December. After which they will continue to have access to the service until the close date.</p>
      <h3>Vue to stop accepting new subscribers</h3>
      <p>While Sony has confirmed when PlayStation Vue will come to an end, the company says nothing is changing in the meantime.</p>
      <p>For example, existing subscribers will retain access to the service and all of the features and perks associated with their streaming package.</p>

      <p>The only exception to this no-change rule is new subscriptions.</p>
      <p>Sony has recently posted a message on the PlayStation Vue <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/network/vue/">welcome page</a> explaining that it will stop accepting new subscribers soon.</p>
      <p>Sony has yet to specify exactly when it will remove the option to sign up, but it's likely to happen in the coming weeks, if not days.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>Evidently, with the service in its final few months, it makes sense that PlayStation plans to discontinue the option to subscribe.</p>
      <h3>What should subscribers do now?</h3>
      <p>Sony is right about the "<i>highly competitive</i>" TV industry. In the wake of live TV streaming, a number of services have launched.</p>
      <p>While this is good news for consumers, it does place additional pressure on services like PlayStation Vue, as well as <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2019/03/android-tv-paytv-operator-growth.html">traditional TV providers</a>.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>If you are a current PlayStation Vue subscriber, you will soon have to start deciding on what to do either before January 30, 2020 or when the service eventually shuts down.</p>
      <p>Currently, there are a number of similar alternative you can opt for. These include <a href="http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-5881789-13803718">AT&amp;T TV NOW</a>, <a href="http://www.fubo.tv/welcome?irad=343747&amp;irmp=334843">fuboTV</a>, <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=6kPwAD1/gQA&amp;offerid=616833.57&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0">Hulu + Live TV</a>, <a href="http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-5881789-13261876">Sling TV</a>, and <a href="https://tv.youtube.com/welcome/">YouTube TV</a></p>
      <p>Similar to PlayStation Vue, all of these services provide access to live TV over the internet.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>All of them also offer a free trial so they are available to test out before having to commit and pay for the service.</p>
