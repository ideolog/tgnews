      <p>"Death is always interesting for people because this is something that is incomprehensible." That's according to the Art Director of The Death Museum in the city of Novosibirsk, Russia.</p>
      <p>The museum houses some 30,000 artefacts collected from all over the world, which tell the story of death and mourning in different human cultures.</p>
      <p>There are several display areas dedicated to exploring funeral and grieving rites, including the Victorian-era practice of "post-mortem photography - the tradition of making photographs of dead relatives.</p>
