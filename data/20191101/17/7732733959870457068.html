      <h4>In brief: Get ready to hook up your gaming rig to your 55- or 65-inch LG. The company just started rolling out G-Sync firm to its current year OLED models. Now that HDMI 2.1 comes with variable refresh rate support standard, we may starting seeing platform agnostic active-sync in many newer TVs.</h4>
      <p>We told you it was <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/81824-lg-2019-oled-tvs-soon-receive-g-sync.html">coming</a> back in September and now it is here.</p>
      <p>On Friday, LG <a href="http://www.lgnewsroom.com/2019/11/lg-oled-tvs-to-receive-nvidia-g-sync-upgrade-starting-this-week/">announced</a> that it is sending out G-Sync firmware to its compatible 2019 OLED televisions. Sets that will be getting the update include 65- and 55-inch E9, C9, and B9 models. The firmware updates will start rolling out in North America this week. Other regions will be receiving the G-Sync firmware before the end of the year.</p>
      <p>As you might know, G-Sync is Nvidia's <a href="https://www.techspot.com/article/1454-gsync-vs-freesync/">solution to screen-tearing</a> and stuttering. The technology uses a variable refresh rate that synchronizes with the GPU's frame rate. So every frame is correctly rendered in time with a refresh of the screen. AMD's version of the tech is called FreeSync.</p>
      <p>Of course, you will need an Nvidia GeForce RTX 20-series or GTX 16-series GPU to take advantage of the new firmware.</p>
      <p>Aside from gaming, some might be thinking, "Why would I have my PC hooked up to my TV?" Others might already be enjoying computing on a 55-inch screen.</p>
      <p>I started using my 55-inch 4K Visio for work two years ago and haven't looked back. In fact, I become irritable when, for whatever reason, I have to use a smaller monitor.</p>
      <p>If you have never considered using a large 4K TV as a PC display, you should read our <a href="https://www.techspot.com/article/1439-using-4k-tv-as-desktop-pc-monitor/">write-up</a> on the hows and whys.</p>
