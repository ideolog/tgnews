      <p>A clerical staffer at a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/louisiana">Louisiana</a> medical clinic was arrested after being accused of selling doctor’s notes that high school students would use to skip class.</p>
      <p>Belinda Fondren’s <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/walls-of-jericho-drummer-arrested-marijuana">arrest</a> on a false record charge was announced this week by the Vernon Parish Sheriff’s Office.</p>
      <p>The case against the 52-year-old Evans woman stemmed from complaints that she was “selling medical excuses to students at local high schools,” the office said.</p>
