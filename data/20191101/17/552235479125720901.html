      <p>Jeremy Corbyn welcomed the announcement.</p>
      <p>In a tweet the Labour leader said: “This is a once in a generation election.</p>
      <p>“So it’s welcome that Boris Johnson has accepted our challenge of a head to head TV debate.</p>
      <p>The choice could not be clearer: Boris Johnson’s Conservatives protecting the privileged few or a Labour government on the side of the many.”</p>

      <p>Johnson also took to Twitter to comment on the debate.</p>
      <p>"Looking forward to making the positive case to the country that we should £GetBrexitDone &amp; deliver on the people's priorities - £OurNHS, schools, tackling crime &amp; the cost of living," he said.</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister was accused of running scarred from TV debates by rival Jeremy Hunt during the race to take over the Tory Party after the departure of Theresa May.</p>
      <p>Johnson did take part in two one-on-one debates during the battle for the Tory crown, but not before Mr Hunt and others placed him under great pressure to do so.</p>
      <p>Confirming the tussle ITV press tweeted: “ITV will show the first head-to-head debate between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn on 19th November.</p>
      <p>“Details of further multi-party debate and comprehensive general election coverage in due course”.</p>
