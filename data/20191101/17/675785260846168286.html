      <p>Kim Kardashian has treated us to not one but two <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/halloween">Halloween</a> looks this year, proving she does not do spooky festivities by halves.</p>
      <p>After wowing fans with her <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/kim-kardashian-transforms-elle-woods-20783315">Legally Blonde homage</a> - that included a full recreation of the Harvard Law School video from the movie - Kim has returned to social media a day later with her second stab at fancy dress.</p>
      <p>This time Kim, 39, had her whole family transform into The Flinstones.</p>

      <p>Kim shared snaps on insta of her rocking the iconic blue mini dress and cropped black wig made famous in the cartoon by Betty Rubble.</p>
      <p>The reality star also roped in her four children and even husband <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/kanye-west">Kanye West</a> to help complete the look.</p>
      <p>Her eldest daughter North donned a white dress, red wig and rock necklace to become Betty's pal and neighbour Wilma Flinstone.</p>

      <p>While Kim's youngest daughter Chicago also got into the Halloween spirit as she dressed as the Flinstones' baby Pebbles.</p>
      <p>If that wasn't enough, Kim shared even more snaps that revealed her son Saint dressed as lead character Fred Flinstone while baby Psalm was a very adorable Bamm Bamm Rubble.</p>
      <p>And there were no prizes for guessing who Dino the dinosaur was.</p>

      <p>Step forward, Kanye West who was hiding inside an incredible giant purple bodysuit.</p>
      <p>But there was one person who wasn't too impressed with Kanye's outfit.</p>
      <p>Kim revealed her daughter Chicago had to be Photoshopped onto the family picture because she was too frightened to stand beside her dinosaur daddy.</p>

      <p>Kim explained: "This family pic was such a challenge because Chicago was so scared of Dino! LOL We tried to explain and show her that it was just daddy but she didnâ€™t get the concept yet!</p>
      <p>"So shout out to the photographer for editing her in &amp; making our family Flinstones dreams come true!"</p>
      <p>Yabba Dabba Doo!</p>
