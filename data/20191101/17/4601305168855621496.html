      <h1>Report from a massive Chinese surveillance tech expo, where junk-science "emotion recognition" rules</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T17:04:34+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 17:04</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://boingboing.net/author/cory_doctorow_1" target="_blank">Cory Doctorow</a></address>
      <p>Sue-Lin Wong is the <i>Financial Times</i>'s South China reporter; this week, she attended the China Public Security expo, the country's largest surveillance tech show, held biannually in Shenzhen.</p>
      <p>In a ghastly and fascinating <a href="https://twitter.com/suelinwong/status/1190194625572569093">Twitter thread</a>, Wong provides a tour of a few of the most noteworthy elements of the expo (though <a href="https://twitter.com/suelinwong/status/1190194692270346245">she notes</a> that "The expo was utterly overwhelming, I must have only seen a fraction of it").</p>
      <p>A major trend from the show is "emotion recognition" -- a <a href="https://boingboing.net/2019/07/20/resting-counterintuitive-face.html">junk-science infused</a> buzzword that is heavily marketed by "AI" companies both inside and outside China.</p>
      <p>My other big takeaway from Wong's writeup is that surveillance tech has found niches in every domain of human life: from street-level surveillance to education to the electric grid to health to criminal justice.</p>
      <p>I was also <a href="https://twitter.com/suelinwong/status/1190195713470164992">fascinated by Wong's photos</a> of tiny surveillance cameras, including some hidden in the bridges of glasses.</p>
