      <p>Australian party-starting electro-pop collective <b>Haiku Hands</b>, who played one of the <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/the-15-best-sets-we-saw-at-sxsw-2019/">15 best sets we saw at SXSW 2019</a>, signed to Mad Decent for their debut album, which is due out in 2020. They’ve also shared a dancefloor-ready new single produced by Mad Zach, “Onset,” which you can listen to below.</p>
      <p>The group’s Claire Nakazawa says:</p>
      <blockquote>“Onset” is the kind of track that you can listen to while walking down the street and feel like you own it. To me it’s a power track, about owning your power, sharing and enjoying it. Classic rap braggadocious with a conscious tip. Feeling the good vibes and not sweating the small stuff. The beat references classic genres. Mad Zach’s musical knowledge shines through as he incorporates sounds and elements from old school 80’s &amp; 90’s hip hop, rave and electro and combines them with contemporary, new school electronic production. The result being a fresh, nostalgic, head banging track that you’ve never heard before. Onset is colourful, wild and rude. Get into it.</blockquote>
