      <p>On the eve of meeting Southampton for the second time in the space of four days, Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola says he agreed with Liverpool counterpart Jürgen Klopp that there are too many games for top-flight players.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, Klopp threatened to forfeit a Carabao Cup quarter-final tie unless 'an appropriate date to play' was found as the original fixture clashes with a Club World Cup game for Liverpool in Qatar.</p>
