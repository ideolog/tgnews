      <p>Pakistan's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth has slowed down to 3.3 per cent in the financial year 2019 to date — a 2.2 percentage point decline compared to the previous year — due to the stabilisation measures undertaken by the authorities,<a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/pakistan/overview"> as per the World Bank</a>.</p>
      <p>However, the Pakistan government has maintained its focus on internationalising the Kashmir issue ever since the abrogation of its special status by the Indian Parliament.</p>
      <p>A recent survey has reflected that Pakistani citizens have a different outlook on the most significant challenges to their country. They shared that inflation and unemployment are bigger problems and not Kashmir.</p>
      <p>The <a href="http://gallup.com.pk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/29th-October-2019-English.pdf">survey conducted by Gallup International</a> in all four provinces – Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab and Sindh – of the cash-strapped country has also listed the water crisis, corruption and political instability as problems.</p>
      <p>According to data from the State Bank of Pakistan, the total debt of Pakistan rose by Rs. 7,509 billion ($48.1 billion) during the first year of the Imran Khan-led government.</p>
      <p>In July, Pakistan received a <a href="https://sputniknews.com/business/201910021076944331-6-billion-imf-loan-may-be-last-for-pakistan-countrys-central-bank-chief-warns/">$6 billion bailout package</a> under a 39-month extended arrangement from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).</p>
      <p>Thousands marched towards the capital Islamabad on Thursday as part of a protest against the current government's economic failure. The Azadi March was organised by Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam Fazl (JUI-F) and led by Maulana Fazlur Rehman. </p>
