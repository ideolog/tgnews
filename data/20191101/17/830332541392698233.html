      <p>MADISON, Wis. - Officers were called to East High School in Madison after several fights broke out in the cafeteria during lunch.</p>
      <p>East High's school resource officer called for backup around 12:20 p.m. Thursday, according to Joel DeSpain, a spokesman for the Madison Police Department. Ten officers responded to the school.</p>
      <p>Officers said an initial fight, involving three students, sparked a couple of other confrontations.</p>
      <p>The parents of one student involved were also part of the conflict, DeSpain said, but it is unclear if either were physical with anyone.</p>
      <p>One student involved suffered a medical emergency and was taken to the hospital as a precaution, DeSpain said.</p>
      <p>The school resource officer is reviewing surveillance video and speaking to witnesses.</p>
      <p>No arrests have been made, but the investigation is ongoing, DeSpain said.</p>
