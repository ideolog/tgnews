      <p><b>BERLINÂ (AP)</b> - Workers have hoisted a rainbow-colored net of 100,000 streamers - many with messages of love and peace - in front of Berlin's iconic Brandenburg Gate as part of next week's commemoration of the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall.</p>
      <p>The installation, called "Visions in Motion," is the work of Los Angeles artist Patrick Shearn, who has created similar moving sculptures elsewhere in the world.</p>
      <p>Shearn told The Associated Press on Friday that he wanted to convey the sense of a dynamic world by stringing 20,000 square feet of ripstop nylon sailcloth that moves with the wind. He hoped it would reflect the widespread desire for peace.</p>
      <p>Among the 30,000 handwritten notes were messages such as "Love wins," ''Revolution" and "I hope the wall in (people's) heads disappears too."</p>
