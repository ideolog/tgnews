      <p>The man escorted out of Stellenbosch University's library for allegedly masturbating has been cleared of any wrongdoing after he submitted documentation to the institution denying any inappropriate behaviour.</p>
      <p>"The man in a social media video seemingly committing an inappropriate act in the Stellenbosch University (SU) library on October 29, 2019, has submitted a sworn statement, supported by a medical certificate, denying any inappropriate behaviour.</p>
      <p>"An examination by a doctor at SU campus' health services confirmed the diagnosis which is consistent with his account of events," university spokesperson Susan van der Merwe said in a statement on Friday. No further details were given. </p>
      <p>In October, News24 reported that the man was captured on video allegedly masturbating under a study desk.</p>
      <p>The clip, posted by a Stellenbosch student, showed the man sitting with papers spread on the desk in front of him and his right hand moving under the furniture, News24 reported.</p>
      <p>Another clip shows him with his hands behind his back being escorted out of the library by campus security guards.</p>
      <p>Following the incident, counselling was provided to affected students, and the institution's security and equality units undertook to investigate the incident.</p>
      <p>A case of public indecency was not reported with the Stellenbosch police at the time.</p>
