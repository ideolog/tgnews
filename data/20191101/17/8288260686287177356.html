      <p>West Bromwich Albion could be set to lose star loanee <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/grady-diangana">Grady Diangana</a> in the January transfer window.</p>
      <p>That's according to <a href="https://www.footballinsider247.com/exclusive-west-ham-plot-january-player-exchange-with-west-brom/">Football Insider</a> , who claim West Ham United will recall the winger who has racked up four goals and three assists in his first 12 games with <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/west-bromwich-albion-fc">Albion</a> .</p>
      <p>The forward has wasted no time winning over fans at The Hawthorns, helping his loan club to the top of the Championship table.</p>
      <p>But just like when Harvey Barnes was recalled by Leicester in January of last season, <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/west-bromwich-albion-fc">West Brom</a> 's promotion hopes could be dealt a significant blow.</p>
      <p>Football Insider claim West Ham are planning on recalling <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/grady-diangana">Diangana</a> in the winter window..</p>

      <p>But they are, if the report is to be believed, going to soften the blow by sending young winger Nathan Holland to <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/west-bromwich-albion-fc">West Brom</a> to take <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/grady-diangana">Diangan</a> a's place.</p>
      <p>The report claims a West Ham source has described the exchange as a 'live' option.</p>
      <p>Holland is a 21-year-old wide man who has been with West Ham since 2017, when he arrived from Everton.</p>
      <p>The youngster was also an England under-19 international. He is yet to register a senior appearance in professional football.</p>
