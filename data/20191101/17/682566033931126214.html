      <p>Cape Town -<b> Highlands Park </b>coach <b>Owen da Gama </b>has slammed <b>Tshegofatso Mabasa's </b>tackle on <b>Lindokuhle Mbatha </b>in the <b>1-0</b> defeat to<b> Orlando Pirates </b>on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Mabasa was extremely lucky to escape with a yellow card as Mbatha had to receive an injection at half-time but is still set for a lengthy spell on the sidelines.</p>
      <p>Da Gama was seen in animated conversation with Mabasa after the game and the Lions of the North tactician has revealed exactly what he said to the Buccanneers striker.</p>
      <p>"I told him, I said, 'Boy, you cant play like that. You canâ€™t tackle people with two-footed tackles. You will end people's careers'," Da Gama told <a href="https://www.kickoff.com/news/articles/south-africa-news/categories/news/premiership/owen-da-gama-reveals-what-he-said-to-tshegofatso-mabasa-after-tackle-on-lindokuhle-mbatha/666527">KickOff</a>.</p>
      <p>"He said, 'No he (Mbatha) jumped'. I said it doesn't matter if he didn't jump it would have broken his leg.</p>
      <p>"That should have been a red card. Two-footed tackle. Mbatha had to get an injection at half-time. He never recovered from that. He is still in pain. I don't know if he will play again."</p>
      <p>Highlands next turn their attention to a Telkom Knockout quarter-final clash with Maritzburg United on Friday night.</p>
      <p>Kick-off is at 20:00.</p>
