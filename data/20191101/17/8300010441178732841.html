      <p>A USC student program called the Trojan Shelter is offering free housing, meals and resources for students experiencing homelessness.<br/><br/>Organizers say homelessness is a mostly invisible issue on campus, but some people are consistently sleeping in cars, libraries and on friends' couches because of the lack of affordable housing in Los Angeles.<br/><br/>The <a href="https://www.trojanshelter.org/">Trojan Shelter</a> will be located at St. Mary's Episcopal Church on South Mariposa Avenue. The grand opening ceremony was scheduled for Friday. Doors will open officially on Nov. 15.<br/><br/>The university says its students were inspired by UCLA's Bruin Shelter.<br/><br/><i>Watch Eyewitness This for more stories making headlines.</i></p>
