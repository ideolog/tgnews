      <p>The design website Core77 has a weekly feature called <a href="https://www.core77.com/posts/91032/The-Weekly-Design-Roast-23">Design Roast</a>, devoted to making fun of bad industrial design. My "favorite" this time around is a portable leather chess board with rubber pieces that you are meant to wrap around stones you gather before you can play.</p>
      <blockquote>This is a leather chess board that comes with silicone bands delineating the pieces; you're meant to find and gather rocks to tie the bands around, in order to complete the pieces (I'm not kidding). I'd like to see a Checkers variant of this--it would come with the board, a sausage, a zucchini, and a chef's knife.</blockquote>
