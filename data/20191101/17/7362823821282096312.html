      <p>People generally run <i>away</i> from Godzilla in the movies, but a new <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel/general/theme-parks">theme park</a> attraction in Japan is hoping to have the opposite effect.</p>
      <p>The Nijigen no Mori theme park, located on Awaji Island just south of Kobe, is planning to debut a whole new Godzilla-themed area, complete with what the park is calling a 'life-size' likeness of “dragon-like” kaiju at the center.</p>

      <p>Set to debut in 2020, the Godzilla area — to be called “Godzilla Interception Operation Awaji,” per the park’s website — will feature a zip line that will “rush into the body of Godzilla” as well as shooting galleries for allowing guests to take aim at Godzilla’s radioactive cells.</p>
      <p>The attraction also comes with its own backstory, according to a <a href="http://nijigennomori.com/category/news/">press release</a> issued by the theme park. As per the story, Godzilla attacked Awaji Island long ago, and when he returned, the government tripped him up with explosives and shoved a drugged missile into his mouth.</p>
