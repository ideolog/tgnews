      <p>A charity has shared a heartbreaking photo of a little girl in a princess dress queueing for food on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/halloween">Halloween</a> night.</p>
      <p>Feed Our Homeless in Dublin, Ireland, posted pictures of people lining up to get a meal at their food station yesterday evening.</p>
      <p>Huge queues of homeless people waited in the lashing rain for hot food - as well as support from the charity.</p>
      <p>Among those waiting, a young girl was photographed in what appears to be a fancy dress princess gown with a coat over the top.</p>
      <p>Next to her stood an even younger boy also looking to be fed.</p>
