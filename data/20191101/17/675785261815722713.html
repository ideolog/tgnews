      <h2>Gemma Collins will be the centre of attention as she makes a dramatic return to Dancing On Ice's Christmas special</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T17:20:38+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 17:20</time> by <a rel="author">Verity Sulway, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/verity-sulway/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/gemma-collins">Gemma Collins</a> is set to star in a the biggest role in the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/dancing-on-ice">Dancing On Ice</a> Christmas special in December.</p>
      <p>The reality star competed in the show earlier this year, where she suffered a nasty fall during one of her performances.</p>
      <p>She also became embroiled in a bitter row with judge Jason Gardiner over his harsh criticism of her, often relating to her weight.</p>
      <p>But Gemma, 38, is putting all that behind her and will be coming back to perform on the show's Christmas special, alongside Ray Quinn and Jake Quickenden.</p>
      <p>This will also be a chance for Gemma to showcase her incredible new figure, after she shed three stone this year.</p>
      <p>Her weight loss was kick started by her ice-skating, and assisted by controversial appetite-suppressing injections.</p>

      <p>A source told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/">The Sun</a> : Gemma is chomping at the bit to get back on the ice as she knows it's her safe place and will take her mind off her Arg drama.</p>
      <p>"Bosses are ready to make Gemma the star of the show again.</p>
      <p>"She wants to be the showstopper for the Christmas special, and is proving to producers she is ready for it.</p>
      <p>"She'll be giving a jaw-dropping performance when she returns to the rink alongside Ray Quinn and Jake Quickenden."</p>

      <p>MirrorOnline has reached out to a representative for Gemma for comment.</p>
      <p>Gemma was incredibly popular when she appeared on the show in January, with 1.9million fewer viewers tuning in the week after she was eliminated.</p>
      <p>It's a particularly exciting time for The GC, who recently filmed scenes for her return to The Only Way is Essex, and also signed a whopping £1.1million contract to be the face of Poundland's new homeware range.</p>

      <p>This will reportedly see herplugging Poundland's range of cleaning products and soft furnishings in one of the biggest ever endorsement deals the brand has signed.</p>
      <p>Gemma, 38, is already believed to be worth around £2.7 million, and will be laughing all the way to the bank after this latest cheque cashes.</p>
      <p>Gemma also owns two clothing stores, has brought out a Boohoo line, released a perfume, two books, and is bringing out a Christmas single this year.</p>
