      <h1>Arsenal are toxic again... they could copy post-Sir Alex Ferguson Man Utd</h1>
      <h2>Arsenal fans are starting to turn on Unai Emery, Granit Xhaka has lashed out at supporters and there is a clamour for Mesut Ozil's return</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T17:15:00+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 17:15</time> by <a rel="author">Robbie Savage, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/robbie-savage/</a></address>
      <p>Whether or not Granit Xhaka captains Arsenal again, a toxic atmosphere at the Emirates is by far the bigger picture.</p>
      <p>Apart from Xhaka being jeered off by his own supporters last weekend, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang was accosted by idiots and abused as he drove away from the 2-2 draw with Crystal Palace... although he is probably the Gunners’ best player.</p>
      <p>And manager Unai Emery was serenaded by fans calling for the return of playmaker Mesut Ozil.</p>
      <p>If Arsenal are not careful, they will be back in a cycle where unrest among the fans could force out the manager, like Emery’s predecessor Arsene Wenger.</p>
      <p>And they could end up going down the same path as Manchester United’s decline since Sir Alex Ferguson retired.</p>

      <p>The situation with Xhaka is an unhappy scenario, but you have to say Emery contributed to it.</p>
      <p>Being captain of a massive club like Arsenal should not be decided by a popularity contest, and holding a poll of the players, because every dressing room has its cliques.</p>
      <p>I captained four clubs in the Premier League, and to wear the armband I believe you have to be one of the best players and worth your place in the side every week.</p>
      <p>If they had been popularity contests, maybe I wouldn’t have captained all four.</p>
      <p>Is Xhaka the Gunners’ best player? Not in the eyes of most people.</p>

      <p>Is he worth a place in their starting XI every week? That’s highly debatable.</p>
      <p>What is definitely not acceptable is for trolls on social media to make death threats against his wife or wish that his little daughter gets cancer.</p>
      <p>That sort of abuse is way below the belt. And scapegoating never looks pretty.</p>
      <p>And as the captain who sets an example, Xhaka was wrong to behave the way he did when he was hooked against Palace - but he is only human, and as he said in his statement on Thursday night, he reached “boiling point.”</p>
      <p>Clearly Xhaka has the respect of his team-mates, if not the fans, but his fate as skipper is not Emery’s only problem – not by a long chalk.</p>

      <p>He has spent £205 million in three transfer windows now, and he appears no closer to establishing an identity for his team.</p>
      <p>The fans pay good money to watch, and they are entitled to their opinion, although booing one of your own players can never be right in my book.</p>
      <p>It seems to happen mainly at home – there seems to be more unity between the away supporters and their team.</p>
      <p>Aaron Ramsey, scorer of two FA Cup final winners, went through a difficult period a few years ago, and now he has gone to Juventus, suddenly the supporters wish he was still in north London.</p>
      <p>But for Emery, the rumbles of thunder seem to be growing louder.</p>
      <p>As one inspired Gunners supporter, @laythy29, observed:</p>
      <p>Emery’s Arsenal is a pressing team that can’t press.</p>

      <p>He has a side that wants to play out from the back but they can’t.</p>
      <p>It’s a team packed with talented players who can’t function.</p>
      <p>He picked a captain to lead the side who isn’t worth his place.</p>
      <p>His defenders can’t defend.</p>
      <p>And his most creative player can’t create because he was being frozen out – until the game on Wednesday, when Ozil shone against Liverpool’s kids.</p>
      <p>Ouch – that’s not a great tribute when you have spent £200m.</p>
      <p>I thought Arsenal should have finished in the top four last season, when they blew it by losing at home to Palace on the run-in, and although they reached the Europa League final, their defeat by Chelsea in Baku was embarrassing.</p>
      <p>And after losing to United in the FA Cup, and Tottenham in the EFL Cup, I have to ask: Does Emery’s Arsenal produce the goods often enough in the big games?</p>
      <p>Look, I think he deserves at least one more transfer window, and he should be judged at the end of this season.</p>
      <p>If he delivers an improvement on last year’s fifth place, and wins a trophy, he can justifiably claim the club has progressed on his watch.</p>
      <p>Or do Arsenal want to go down the same road as United? They have spent £900m at Old Trfford since Fergie stepped down, and they are already on their fourth manager since 2014.</p>
      <p>My take is that Arsenal should stick with Emery – a proven winner at Sevilla – and that the supporters should be careful what they wish for.</p>
      <p>If they come unstuck against Wolves this weekend, there will be an air of mutiny.</p>
      <p>But what will the fans achieve if they drive Emery out, just as hammering Xhaka and Aubameyang will achieve nothing positive?</p>
      <p>Currently, Arsenal are above United and Tottenham in the Premier League, and the four-point gap to Chelsea is not insurmountable.</p>
      <p>If the Gunners finish above those three clubs in May, in my book that would be a huge success.</p>
