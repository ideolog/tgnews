      <p>Kelly Clarkson fans have been waiting for a moment like this: The singer is getting her very own Las Vegas residency.</p>
      <p>The original "American Idol" winner made the announcement Friday on her daytime talk show.</p>
      <p>"It's not an April Fools' joke, but it does debut April 1," Clarkson said.</p>
      <p>The Vegas show, titled "Invincible" after one of Clarkson's songs, will run to September 2020 at Zappos Theater at Planet Hollywood Resort and Casino. A list of dates was posted to Clarkson's official website.</p>
      <p>The announcement comes as Clarkson is almost two months into her talk show.</p>
      <p>Since debuting in September, "The Kelly Clarkson Show" is ranking fourth among syndicated daytime talk shows, according to Nielsen data.</p>
      <p>"When I launched this show, I heard from fans everywhere who were worried I'd stop putting out new music and touring," Clarkson said. "Well, don't worry. I got you."</p>
      <p>Clarkson gave a pair of tickets to every member of her audience while making the announcement, plus accommodations and a dinner.</p>
      <p>"It's a full experience," she said.</p>
