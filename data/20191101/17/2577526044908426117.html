      <p>The weekend is for baking a cake. I think I could stand to eat a whole cake.</p>
      <p>I haven’t got very far in <i>The Outer Worlds</i>, so I’d like to spend more time with that. I’ve also been playing a lot of <i>Lonely Mountains</i>, which is so fun, even though I spend most of my time crashing.</p>
      <p>What about you? What are you playing?</p>
