        <b>A man in Connecticut has been arrested after children’s trick or treat snacks were spiked with razor blades.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Jason Racz was arrested on Thursday after multiple parents complained their kids had found blades in their baskets of sweets.</p>
      <p>Shakira Santiago was one of the mothers who made the heinous discovery. She took to Facebook to warn other parents what their children may be about to find.</p>
      <p>‘Wow Parents BEWARE! WATERBURY Hopeville neighborhood!!’ she wrote. ‘Found two razors in my sons basket. I feel like going back to each house we went to, wasn’t many either.’</p>

      <p>She continued: ‘Lucky he didn’t cut his finger and I checked everything. People are so malicious.’</p>
      <p>Fortunately, no one was reported to be injured as a result of a spiked sweets, according to <a href="https://www.wkrg.com/top-stories/man-arrested-after-razor-blades-found-in-halloween-baskets/"><i>WKRG’</i></a>.</p>
      <p>After being arrested, 37-year-old told police the blades had been accidentally spilled into the candy bowl he had been using.</p>
      <p>After investigating, police determined a three-year-old who was living in the house had access to the sweets, however they’re yet to reveal whether they believe the toddler was to blame.</p>

      <p>One of the people found a blade and cut their finger while sorting through their sweets. They were forced to go to hospital for stitches. Fortunately, no one else reported injuries.</p>
      <p>Both of the people who found the blades had gone trick or treating in the same neighbourhood in the Cincinnati suburb, according to reports in <a href="https://edition-m.cnn.com/2019/11/01/us/razor-blades-ohio-candy-halloween-trnd/index.html"><i>CNN</i></a>. While they know what area the tampered candy came from, they were unable to decipher which house it could’ve been.</p>
      <p>Police are now urging parents and children to be mindful of the potential risks of picking up less than savoury ‘tricks’ while out trick or treating this year.</p>
