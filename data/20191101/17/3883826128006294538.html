        <b>Red Bull's Max Verstappen led Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel in an unrepresentative first practice session at the United States Grand Prix.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The order was mixed after many drivers spent time trying out a 2020 Pirelli development tyre.</p>
      <p>Verstappen's quickest time was set on the standard 'soft' tyre, while Vettel ran the test tyre for his best lap.</p>
      <p>Lewis Hamilton, poised to clinch his sixth world title this weekend, was down in eighth place in his Mercedes.</p>
      <p>Hamilton, who was 1.382 seconds off the pace, will win the championship this weekend as long as team-mate Valtteri Bottas does not win the race and the Briton finish lower than eighth.</p>

      <p>Vettel's team-mate Charles Leclerc set second fastest time but had it deleted for exceeding track limits at Turn 19.</p>
      <p>That was on the 'standard' soft tyre and the 22-year-old was left to rely on his best lap on the 2020 tyre for his sixth place.</p>
      <p>Leclerc was behind Toro Rosso's Pierre Gasly and Renault's Daniel Ricciardo and ahead of the Racing Point of Lance Stroll and the second Toro Rosso of Daniil Kvyat.</p>
      <p>A number of drivers complained about the bumps on the Circuit of the Americas.</p>
      <p>Hamilton, who says it is one of his favourite tracks, said: "This must be the bumpiest track in the world." And Haas driver Kevin Magnussen described "a jump - not a bump - at Turn Nine", which was causing part of his hybrid system to cut out.</p>
