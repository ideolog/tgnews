      <p>Earlier this year WhatsApp introduced Face ID and fingerprint unlock for iPhone users. Now it has bestowed biometric security on Android as well.</p>
      <p><a href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/10000663/Introducing-Fingerprint-Lock-for-Android">WhatsApp announced</a> the rollout on a blog post overnight, stating that supported Android devices would now allow for Fingerprint ID.</p>
      <p>You can toggle it one by going to <b>Settings &gt; Account &gt; Privacy &gt; Fingerprint Lock</b>.</p>
      <p>You also have a number of options to choose from when it comes to locking the app - immediately, 1 minute and 30 minutes. After your chosen lock time has passed you'll need to scan your fingerprint again to unlock the app.</p>
      <p>There is also an option to show content in notifications.</p>
      <p>Fingerprint unlock is available on compatable Android devices from today. It's unclear when Face ID for WhatsApp will be coming to Android devices. [<a href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/10000663/Introducing-Fingerprint-Lock-for-Android">WhatsApp</a>]</p>
