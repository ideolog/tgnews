      <h1>A TV Show Based On Tamora Pierce's Books Is Finally Happening</h1>

      <p>If you love the Arya and Sansa storylines in <i>Game Of Thrones, </i>have I got some good news for you: On Friday, Deadline announced that a <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/lionsgate-little-women-producer-playground-plot-fantasy-world-with-tamora-pierces-tortall-universe-series-1202771376/">TV show based on Tamora Pierce's Tortall Universe</a> is coming soon. The news comes nearly five years after Pierce told <a href="https://www.themarysue.com/tammy-pierce-books-on-screen/">The Mary Sue</a> that her novels would likely never be brought to the screen, much to fans' disappointment. Stories from the Tortall Universe have largely focused on young heroines defying gender-based expectations, and thus have been incredibly influential to generations of writers and readers alike.</p>
      <p>The first peek readers got at the Tortall Universe came in 1983, when Tamora Pierce published <i>Alanna: The First Adventure</i>. The story of a young girl who disguises herself as a boy in order to become a knight, <i>Alanna</i> kicked off the Song of the Lioness, a four-book series that was completed with <i>Lioness Rampant</i> in 1988.</p>
      <p>Pierce wasn't done with Tortall after that, however. She went on to write five more series of three and four books each, the most recent of which, <i>Tempests and Slaughter</i>, landed on shelves in 2018. In addition to main-series titles, Pierce has published two other books set in the Tortall Universe: <i>Tortall and Other Lands: A Collection of Tales</i> and <i>Tortall: A Spy's Guide</i>.</p>
      <p>Two production companies optioned the rights to all 22 books set in Pierce's created world, and I've picked out the six you should read first below. There's no word yet on which books, exactly, the Tortall Universe TV show will cover, however. I've got the lowdown on the six opening books to the various Tortall series below, listed in in-universe chronological order, so you can <a href="https://bookriot.com/2017/03/03/reading-pathways-tortall-universe-tamora-pierce/">pick a place to begin with Tamora Pierce's fantasy world</a>.</p>
