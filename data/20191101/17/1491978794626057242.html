      <p>Authorities in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/jamaica">Jamaica</a> say a member of the women’s national soccer team has been stabbed to death.</p>
      <p>Police said Friday that 20-year-old Tarania Clarke was killed during a fight with another woman over a cellphone. The stabbing occurred late Thursday in the capital of Kingston.</p>
      <p>Officials say the unidentified woman has been detained.</p>
      <p>Clarke, a midfielder who was also captain of the Waterhouse FC in Jamaica’s Women’s League, had just made her senior international debut for the Reggae Girlz in September, scoring a goal in a 12-1 win over Cuba in an Olympic qualifying match.</p>
      <p>Michael Ricketts, president of Jamaica’s football federation, said he was “deeply saddened” in a statement.</p>
      <p>“This was a young lady who has shown much potential and was very pleasant, warm and had real potential to make it at the highest level,” Ricketts said. “She was very much a part of the Reggae Girlz squad during the recent Olympic qualifiers and did make an impact.</p>
      <p>“I offer condolences to the family and friends of young Clarke.”</p>
      <p>Xavier Gilbert, Clarke’s coach at Excelsior high school, told Jamaica-based cable TV station SportsMax that she was planning on moving to the United States in January to attend university in Florida pending the completion of her paperwork.</p>
      <p>“We were very close. She was captain for the last three years and was a wonderful leader, a wonderful person,” he told the network. “It hurts right now. It’s really sad. She did not deserve this. This really rough right now.”</p>
