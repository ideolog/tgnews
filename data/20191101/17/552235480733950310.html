      <h2>The Scotland international saved three spot-kick as City book their place in the last eight</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T17:16:41+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 17:16</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Thomson, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/paul-thomson/</a></address>
      <p>Lee Alexander was the hero for Glasgow City last night after her penalty saves sent the club into the Champions League quarter-finals.</p>
      <p>The 28-year-old goalkeeper, who grew up in Stewartfield, was in top form as she denied Brondby three times from the spot in a nail-biting 3-1 penalty shootout victory.</p>
      <p>The Danish side had trailed 2-0 going into the second leg at Petershill Park, but they drew level on aggregate after 90 minutes and the sides couldn't be separated during extra-time.</p>

      <p>Alexander made a string of top stops during the match to keep Brondby at bay and in the shootout she denied Julie Tavlo-Petersson, Freje Abilda and Louise Kristiansen, allowing Jo Love to fire home the winning penalty for City.</p>
      <p>That sparked jubilant scenes in front of a delighted home crowd, as manager Scott Booth celebrated with his players on the pitch.</p>
      <p>It's the second time City have reached this stage of the elite competition, having faced Paris Saint Germain in the 2014/15 season, and Alexander said: "It's up there with one of the best moments in my career.</p>
      <p>"I think this seems like a bigger achievement second time around with way that football has progressed across Europe in the last five years with regards to money. <br/><br/>"We are an amateur team competing against teams that will have five-times the budget we have, but again we have shown that we deserve to be at this level."</p>

      <p>Asked if she felt her display was her best in a City shirt, Lee added: "I’m 28 now so I’m probably hitting the peak of my career.</p>
      <p>"I’m very fortunate to have had similar experiences to last night that helps in pressure moments.</p>
      <p>"We are quite an experienced team in terms of some of the players have played at this stages quite a few times but last night was different.</p>
      <p>"We showed on the pitch for the last hour that we can compete at this level and just delighted for everyone involved."</p>

      <p>The Scottish champions, who wrapped up a 13th league title in a row last week, are now in the hat for next Friday's draw alongside giants Wolfsburg, Lyon, Barcelona, PSG, Arsenal, Atletico Madrid and Bayern Munich.</p>
      <p>"I'm not looking too far ahead with regards to the draw, " said the Scotland international.</p>
      <p>"We know the calibre of teams that are left at this stage of the competition.</p>
      <p>"And we are under no illusions that we will be the underdogs in this next tie, but we look forward to the next round."</p>
