      <p>“So surreal to look over at my wife as she watches her dad, @schwarzenegger reprise his role as the baddest robot on the planet, tears streaming down her face, hanging on the edge of her seat,” Pratt said.</p>
      <p>“Priceless. Way to go Arnold! The movie is fantastic! I’m calling you Carl now,” he added.</p>
      <p>Arnold recently <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/terminator-arnold-schwarzenegger-son-in-law-chris-pratt">gave his thoughts</a> on Pratt and had nothing but praise for his “<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/marvel">Guardians of the Galaxy</a>” actor son-in-law.</p>

      <p>"Maybe, we haven't talked about it. But I respect him very much," Schwarzenegger, 72, told <a href="http://www.etonline.com/arnold-schwarzenegger-on-if-hell-star-in-a-movie-with-son-in-law-chris-pratt-exclusive-135141">Entertainment Tonight</a>. "I think he's a very dedicated actor and he trains really hard, he's in good shape physically, and he's talented."</p>
      <p>"But besides all of that, he's great with my daughter," he noted, "and that's the most important part."</p>
      <p>Katherine, 29, tied the knot with Pratt in June after dating the actor for a year. Still, the “Jingle All the Way” star said he was impressed with the man Pratt, 40, showed himself to be.</p>

      <p>"He's just a nice man," Schwarzenegger said of his daughter’s husband. "It's always great when someone is successful and someone has a vision and someone is driven and knows where to go in their life. But if you're not kind and if you're not a real mensch, you know, then you don't have much. He is a real kind person, and he's terrific with her."</p>
