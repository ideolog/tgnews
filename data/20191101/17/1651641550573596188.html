        <b>Epic Store users, begrudgingly or not, rejoice! The Epic Store October update has overhauled the storefront to add some necessary features.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Epic Games’ proprietary storefront is always at the center of some controversy, <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/epic-games-tim-sweeney-blames-valve-for-shenmue-3-kickstarter-controversy/">whether that’s the acquisition of exclusive titles like Shenmue 3 or not</a>, the storefront has indeed lacked basic features.</p>
      <p><a href="https://mspoweruser.com/epic-games-store-development-roadmap-removes-feature-release-dates/">With the removal of Epic’s developmental roadmap, alongside a delay of upcoming features</a>, many wondered when the company would implement much-needed additions to the store.</p>
      <p>The Epic Store October update focuses on the discoverability of games. With 187 games now available on the digital store, it <i>was</i> becoming harder to find interesting titles outside of big acquisitions. This update fixes that.</p>
      <p>With new discoverability tabs for new releases, free games, top sellers and more, it’s easier to find games on the Epic Store. It’s a big deal. With a more optimised backend to alleviate high traffic periods, the store is also more stable.</p>
      <p>Of course, this update will be followed with the addition of more features. While <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/epic-store-cloud-saves-humble/">cloud saves are thankfully already a thing</a>, the development team is also working on some more essential features.</p>
      <p>Wishlists are coming in the future, allowing customers to get a price drop notification for titles of their choosing. An updated library is in the pipeline – <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/steam-library-update/">take that, Steam</a> – alongside <a href="https://opencritic.com/outlet/704/mspoweruser">OpenCritic</a> implementation.</p>
