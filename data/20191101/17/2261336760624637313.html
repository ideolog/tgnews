      <p>Earlier today, Conor McGregor appeared in court and pled guilty to assault for <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/8/15/20806826/video-ufc-conor-mcgregor-allegedly-punches-man-in-pub-over-proper-12-whiskey-spat-mma-crime-news">punching a man at a pub in Drimnagh, Ireland earlier this year</a>.</p>
      <p>McGregor, the former UFC featherweight and lightweight champion, is reported to have apologized to the victim, Desmond Keogh, for his actions but Keogh did not attend the court hearing. ‘The Notorious’ was fined $1,116.68 and promised to never repeat his actions.</p>
      <p>“What I did was very wrong and I’d like to apologize again to the injured party and today before the court and assure you that nothing of this nature will happen again,” McGregor said at the court hearing in Dublin, <a href="https://www.thejournal.ie/mcgregor-assault-4874806-Nov2019/?utm_source=twitter_short">per The Journal</a>.</p>
      <p>Although the victim was not present in court, it’s reported that Keogh accepted McGregor’s apology but chose not to release a formal statement.</p>
      <p>McGregor, 31, is expected to return to the UFC in January to face either Donald Cerrone or Justin Gaethje. The Irishman hasn’t fought since his headlining lightweight bout with Khabib Nurmagomedov at UFC 229, which saw McGregor submitted in the fourth round with a neck crank.</p>
