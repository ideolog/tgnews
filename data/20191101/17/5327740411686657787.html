      <p>Two Surrey men have been arrested and charged in relation to a string of break-and-enters in South Surrey.</p>
      <p>Surrey RCMP announced the arrests of the men, who they describe as prolific offenders, in a release issued Friday morning.</p>
      <p>Bradley Richards, 33, and Michael Reeves, 41, have been charged with fraud offences relating to credit cards stolen during the break-and-enter occurrences.</p>
      <p>Following an ongoing investigation into a recent increase in break-and-enters in the South Surrey area, the RCMP Property Crime Target Team and Community Response Unit executed a search warrant on Oct. 23, at a residence in the 13100-block of 24 Avenue.</p>
      <p>The search yielded a number of items associated to the break-and-enters and thefts in South Surrey.</p>
      <p>The investigation is ongoing and currently includes additional suspects, with further charges being considered, the release states.</p>
      <p>“To have your home broken into by someone can negatively affect a family and their peace of mind,” said Insp. Mike Hall, Surrey RCMP proactive enforcement officer.</p>
      <p>“Our hope is that those affected can take some solace from knowing the investigation has yielded positive results.”</p>
      <p>Anyone with information regarding the break-and-enter or fraud offences is asked to call Surrey RCMP at 604-599-0502 or, to make an anonymous report, contact Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-TIPS or <a href="https://www.solvecrime.ca/">www.solvecrime.ca</a></p>
