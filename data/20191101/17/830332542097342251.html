      <p>(CNN) - Stocks are rallying Friday, with the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite both on track for another record day.</p>
      <p>Both indexes opened at all-time intraday highs, after a better-than-expected jobs report boosted investor sentiment.</p>
      <p>It would be the S&amp;P's third record close of the week. The Nasdaq stands to surpass its July high. The indexes both traded 0.8% higher around midday.</p>
      <p>The Dow is rallying too, but it is further away from its record high. The Dow was up 230 points, or 0.9%, Friday.</p>
      <p>"Solid October jobs data shows the engine of the US economy is humming along despite elevated global uncertainty, a good sign for future growth as improving hiring conditions fuel consumer spending and confidence," said Ryan Detrick, Senior Market Strategist for LPL Financial.</p>
      <p>All three indexes are on track for an increase this week. For the S&amp;P and the Nasdaq it stands to be the fifth-straight week of gains.</p>
      <p>Investors shrugged off another round of weak manufacturing data from the Institute of Supply Management, which showed the third monthly contraction in a row.</p>
