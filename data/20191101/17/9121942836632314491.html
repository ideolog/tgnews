      <p>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — A principal and teacher in Utah have been suspended after a student at their school dressed as Hitler for a Halloween parade.</p>
      <p>After a picture of the costume circulated on social media, Davis County School District spokesman Christopher Williams said Friday that the district put the principal and teacher on paid administrative leave.</p>
      <p>Online photos show the boy wearing a swastika on the sleeve of a long-sleeve dark brown shirt.</p>
      <p>Williams apologized for what happened and said the school district “does not tolerate speech, images or conduct that portray or promote hate in any form.”</p>
      <p>He says the northern Utah school district is investigating the incident. He declined to answer additional questions, including the name and location of the school or if the student was suspended.</p>
