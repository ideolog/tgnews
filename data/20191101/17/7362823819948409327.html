      <p>Philina Cha visited a Starbucks in Northeast Portland on Nov. 6, 2017, where she ordered a hot <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/starbucks-customer-nut-allergy-almond-milk-lawsuit">coffee</a> and cup of hot water. She claims she was given hot water that did not have a properly secured lid, according to the lawsuit. The water spilled down her leg and into her boot, causing severe burns that required skin grafts and left scarring.</p>

      <p>Starbucks has faced lawsuits over its beverage temperatures in the past. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/woman-wins-100000-from-starbucks-in-hot-coffee-lawsuit">In May 2017</a>, the coffee chain paid $100,000 to a Florida customer after a hot coffee left her physically scarred.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/woman-suing-starbucks-claims-hot-tea-killed-her-dog-scalded-her">In September of that same year</a>, a Denver woman sued Starbucks, claiming the scalding hot tea she was served spilled through an unsecured lid and left her with burns, and killed her dog.</p>
