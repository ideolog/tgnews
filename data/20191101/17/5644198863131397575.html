      <p>NEW DELHI: Schools in the Indian capital will be shut until Nov 5, the city government said on Friday (Nov 1), as residents breathed the season's worst air for a third straight day. </p>
      <p>As farm fires from New Delhi's neighboring states sent swathes of smoke into the capital, the city's chief minister Arvind Kejriwal ordered schools to be closed, the minister said in a tweet he posted in Hindi.</p>

      <p>Earlier on Friday, a government-appointed environment panel declared Delhi's air pollution a public health emergency, according to report by Reuters partner ANI that quoted a letter from the Environment Pollution Control Authority.</p>
      <p>"This is a public health emergency as air pollution is now hazardous and will have adverse health impacts on all particularly the children," ANI quoted the letter.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Government-monitored indices that track air pollution hit 500 in several parts of the capital, the maximum recorded by the government's Central Pollution Control Board.</p>
      <p>The index measures the levels of PM 2.5, tiny particulate matter that goes deep into the lungs.</p>
      <p>Levels above 400 indicate severe conditions that put people with healthy lungs as well as those with respiratory illnesses at risk.</p>
      <p>The government will also restrict the number of private vehicles in the city from next week under an "odd-even" scheme based on the number plates.</p>
