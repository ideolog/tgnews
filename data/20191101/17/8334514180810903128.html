      <p>(Reuters) - Elon Musk is going offline from Twitter (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/TWTR.N">TWTR.N</a>) after questioning “the good” of the social networking site.</p>
      <p>“Not sure about good of Twitter,” the Tesla Inc (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/TSLA.O">TSLA.O</a>) Chief Executive Officer tweeted on Friday, following up with “going offline.”</p>
      <p>Musk’s Twitter account was not deactivated as of 1730 GMT.</p>
      <p>“Reddit still seems good,” he said.</p>
      <p>The eccentric billionaire has a history of being playful with his Twitter account, one of corporate America’s most-watched.</p>
      <p>In June, he said he deleted his Twitter account, while also changing his Twitter display name to “Daddy DotCom”.</p>
      <p>Musk has previously been accused by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for disclosing misleading corporate information about Tesla on Twitter.</p>
