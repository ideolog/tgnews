      <h1>Facebook reportedly was in talks to buy Fitbit before Google was</h1>
      <h2>But Google offered twice as much</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T17:25:00+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 17:25</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/chaim-gartenberg" target="_blank">Chaim Gartenberg</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20943318/google-fitbit-acquisition-fitness-tracker-announcement">Google just bought Fitbit</a> today for $2.1 billion dollars, but apparently the search giant wasn’t the only tech company circling — Facebook was purportedly also in talks to buy the fitness tracking firm before Google, <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/facebook-held-talks-to-buy-fitbit-before-google-struck-deal">according to a report from <i>The Information</i></a>.</p>
      <p>It’s not entirely clear what happened with Facebook’s talks, but it’s likely the money played a big part. According to <i>The Information</i>’s report, Facebook was offering Fitbit roughly half of what Google ended up paying, which seems to have swayed the decision in Google’s favor.</p>
      <aside>Facebook has shown interest in fitness tracking before</aside>
      <p>Facebook’s interest in Fitbit may seem odd at first, but it tracks with the company’s recent forays into hardware. Between its Oculus virtual reality headsets, Portal smart speakers, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/25/20883706/facebook-ar-glasses-prototypes-live-maps-announce-oc6">planned AR glasses</a>, the company has a fairly large hardware portfolio that’s widely centered around wearable technology. And it’s easy to imagine a world where Fitbit smartwatches and fitness trackers would work as an accessory to a future AR or VR headset.</p>
      <p>The company has also shown a particular interest in fitness tracking before: back in 2014, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/4/24/5647084/facebook-acquires-moves-fitness-app">Facebook acquired Moves</a>, a then-popular fitness app for Android and iPhone. Facebook would go on to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/2/17528896/facebook-tbh-moves-hello-shut-down-low-usage">shut down Moves</a> four years later due to both a lack of users and a lack of ongoing development.</p>
