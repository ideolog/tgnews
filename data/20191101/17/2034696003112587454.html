      <p>Walt <a href="http://nme.com/tag/disney">Disney</a> Studios co-chairman Alan Horn has claimed <a href="http://nme.com/tag/marvel">Marvel</a>‘s huge appeal will never wane, as long as the films retain the “heart and humour” of previous releases.</p>
      <p>Horn, who also serves as the House of Mouse’s chief creative officer, was asked whether he thought there was a certain time limit on how long Marvel could continue to pull in millions of viewers per movie.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>“The answer is no,” he told <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/hollywood-reporter-executive-roundtable-7-major-studio-chiefs-1250718"><i>The Hollywood Reporter</i></a>. “If the film has a compelling storyline, if it has heart and humor, two things that I insist on, and it’s terrifically well executed, I think there is an audience. But who knows?”</p>
      <p>Reminded by the interviewer that Marvel’s 23 film streak could prove difficult to repeat, Horn doubled down on his comments.</p>

      <p>“It is long,” he began. “But Kevin Feige is working away. He will be making three or four a year. And they are very different from one another, so we’ll see.”</p>
      <p>Disney’s latest Marvel blockbuster, <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/movie/avengers-endgame-review"><i>Avengers: Endgame</i></a>, became the highest grossing movie of all time earlier this year. Currently sitting on $2.78bn (£2.148bn) globally, the final chapter in the superhero team-up series helped the US entertainment giant claim six of the top 10 biggest films in 2019 (so far).</p>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>However, it’s not all gone Disney’s way recently. Their partnership with Sony – which allowed them to include Spider-Man in Marvel’s Cinematic Universe (<i>Avengers: Endgame </i>included) – ended and a compromise failed to materialise.</p>
      <p>Eventually, a solution was reached and Tom Holland’s Spidey is scheduled to return to the MCU.</p>
      <p>Now, in Horn’s new interview with <i>THR</i>, he has revealed that <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/apparently-tom-hollands-spider-man-was-never-really-going-to-leave-the-mcu-2563016">Spider-Man’s exit from the MCU was never really on the cards</a>.</p>
      <p>“The fan base, which is important to all of us, seemed to really respond to what Tom and his folks have done before with our people,” said Horn.</p>
      <p>“They like the fact that the <a href="https://www.nme.com/tag/marvel-cinematic-universe">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a> and Kevin Feige were involved [in the two <i>Spider-Man</i> films]. We heard feedback out there that suggested that joining forces once again was probably really a good idea.”</p>
