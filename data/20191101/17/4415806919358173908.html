      <h1>Anger as cheapest room in new student accommodation in Cork to cost €228 per week</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T17:20:00+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 17:20</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/kevin-oneill/" target="_blank">By Kevin O'Neill</a></address>
      <p>The cost of renting new student apartments in Cork city centre has been criticised by UCC Students' Union (UCCSU).</p>
      <p>Naoise Crowley, welfare officer at UCCSU, criticised the price of the new Lee Point development on the former Beamish &amp; Crawford Brewery site, with some apartments setting students back close to €10,000 for a 38-week academic term.</p>
      <p>For the cheapest available room, a standard en suite, students would be shelling out €228 per week or €3,876 for a 17-week term starting in January 2020.</p>
      <p>The option of booking for 38 weeks, from August 28, 2020, to May 21, 2021, is available too, with the room increasing in cost to €237 per week, or €9,006 for the 38 weeks.</p>
      <p>The ground floor room comes with "loads of storage space, a double bed and well-equipped lounge/kitchens", according to the ad on unineststudents.ie.</p>
      <p>At the top of the scale is the premium-plus room. For students moving in for 18 weeks from January 10, this will cost €247 per week or €4,446 for the term. For those moving in for the 38-week period starting on August 28, 2020, it is €256 per week or €9,728 for the 38 weeks.</p>
      <p>These rooms for a minimum of €247 per week are the biggest available and are part of an apartment with "five or six bedrooms".</p>
      <p>A statement issued by Uninest Student Accommodation said:</p>
      <blockquote>The all-inclusive rates cover all utilities, high-speed broadband, events, security, access to various amenities and an excellent support network.</blockquote>
      <p>UCCSU said it is disappointed to see more high-cost student rentals appearing in the city.</p>
      <p>"The proliferation of this trend towards accommodation that is unaffordable to the vast majority of the students we represent is massively concerning. We recognise that there is a significant shortage in student accommodation in Cork, however, this accommodation isn’t a feasible option for most students," said Ms Crowley.</p>
      <blockquote>Unaffordable student accommodation is pushing our students out into what can only be described as a ‘dysfunctional private rental sector’, with Cork rents increasing by 7.1% between July 2018 and July 2019.</blockquote>
      <p>"Again, this crisis has knock-on effects on student financial hardship, mental health and ultimately access to education."</p>
      <p>The criticism came just days after UCCSU launched a food bank to help students who are struggling to make ends meet.</p>
