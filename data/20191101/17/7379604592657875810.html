Barry Gardiner dismissed the US President as being on the side of the “super rich” and said the Labour boss would focus on Europe if he reached No10. He ranted to the BBC: “The importance would, I think, be with Europe in the first place. 'We need to establish the future relationship that we have with Europe and therefore I would imagine that certainly in the first 12 months, our focus would be on the European Union. 'We are not talking about Jeremy Corbyn wanting to go over to America.” Labour's trade chief Mr Gardiner furiously hit back at Mr Trump after the <u><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/politics/10253903/trump-jeremy-corbyn-nhs-deal/">President said Corbyn in No10 would be "so bad" for the UK.</a></u></li>

Mr Francois, deputy chair of Conservative Eurosceptic group – the ERG, said: “I think Nigel screwed it up. “If you genuinely want to work with another political party, you don’t go on live national television and call them liars, which is what he did. “If that was meant to be to be an olive branch, Nigel completely cocked it up.”</li>

He said: “A vote for Farage risks letting Jeremy Corbyn into Downing Street via the back door – and the country spending 2020 having two referendums on Brexit and Scottish independence. “It will not get Brexit done – and it will create another gridlocked Parliament that doesn’t work.”</li>

He told reporters: “We're going to announce all of that in the next few days.”</li>
