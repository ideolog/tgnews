      <p>Vauxhall Bridge was closed in both directions amid reports of a 'suspicious vehicle'.</p>
      <p>Pedestrians were being stopped from crossing the major bridge in south London due to a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/metropolitan-police">police</a> incident.</p>
      <p>A vehicle was found abandoned just before 4pm and has been examined by specialist detectives.</p>
      <p>The car was left positioned very close to the MI6 building and had its hazard lights on, <a href="https://www.mylondon.news/news/south-london-news/vauxhall-bridge-closure-police-shut-17187696">My London reports.</a></p>
      <p>A nearby theatre - 'Above The Stag' - has also been evacuated 'due to a suspect package' on the bridge.</p>
      <p>South Western Railway said trains were not stopping at Vauxhall due to the incident near the station.</p>
      <p>The scene has been described by a witness as "worrying," adding that the area is "swarming with police". </p>
      <p>Police have since confirmed the vehicle has been deemed as non-suspicious following their investigation.</p>
