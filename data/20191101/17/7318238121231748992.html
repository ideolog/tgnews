      <p>Google will buy Fitbit for almost 2 billion euros, trying to take on Apple and Samsung in the market for fitness trackers and smart watches.</p>
      <p>First and foremost the news raised concerns over data privacy and protection</p>
      <p>Fitbit, which helped pioneer the wearable devices, said: "The company never sells personal information, and Fitbit health and wellness data will not be used for Google ads."</p>
      <p>Google echoes the statement, adding that: "We will give Fitbit users the choice to review, move, or delete their data."</p>
