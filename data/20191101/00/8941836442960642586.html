      <h1>Hintz scores twice, Stars beat Avalanche 2-1</h1>

      <p>DENVER (AP) - <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/roope-hintz/">Roope Hintz</a> has found his stride. So has Anton Khudobin. So have the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dallas-stars/">Dallas Stars</a>, for that matter.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/roope-hintz/">Hintz</a> scored twice, including a short-handed goal in the second period, and the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dallas-stars/">Stars</a> beat the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/colorado-avalanche/">Colorado Avalanche</a> 2-1 on Friday night.</p>
      <p>“A great win by everybody, by the team,” Khudobin said.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/roope-hintz/">Hintz</a> notched his second two-goal game of the season. And Khudobin turned back 38 shots, including one with a second remaining.</p>
      <p>Just like that, the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dallas-stars/">Stars</a> have gone 5-1 since a dismal 1-7-1 start.</p>

      <p>“I thought we came out and had a lot of purpose and intent to our game,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dallas-stars/">Stars</a> coach Jim Montgomery said. “It was just effort. … It was a good hockey game and we were able to come away with a victory.”</p>
      <p>Nathan MacKinnon scored a second-period goal to give him at least a point in all 13 games. It’s the longest stretch to begin a season since Henrik Zetterberg recorded a point in 17 straight for Detroit in 2007-08.</p>
      <p>Philipp Grubauer had 27 saves as Colorado finished 0-2-1 on its three-game homestand.</p>
      <p>“We move on and we have to make sure we get the next one,” Grubauer said.</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p>It’s a quick turnaround with both teams playing again Saturday - Colorado in Arizona and Dallas hosting Montreal.</p>
        <p>“Play the same way we played today,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/roope-hintz/">Hintz</a> said.</p>
        <p>One of Khudobin’s top saves in the final period came when his right skate kept out a wrap-around try from J.T. Compher. The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dallas-stars/">Stars</a> clamped down over the final 1:35 after Colorado pulled Grubauer for an extra skater.</p>
        <p>Grubauer kept it a one-goal game midway through the third by stopping four rapid shots down low, including three back-hand attempts by Alexander Radulov.</p>
        <p>For Colorado coach Jared Bednar, this game got away early with the team’s “lack of focus and execution.”</p>
        <p>“We weren’t mentally engaged in the game,” Bednar insisted. “You’re not going to win if you don’t play 60 minutes. I don’t care who it’s against.”</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dallas-stars/">Stars</a> jumped out a 2-0 lead as they carried over the momentum from a big comeback win. On Tuesday, they scored six straight goals in a 6-3 win over Minnesota.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/roope-hintz/">Hintz</a> got his first goal of the game with 1:54 remaining in the first period when he gathered up his own rebound and lined it through the pads of Grubauer. His short-hander was early in the second as the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/colorado-avalanche/">Avalanche</a> made a sloppy line change.</p>
        <p>He has a team-leading nine goals.</p>
        <p>“I don’t know if I’m doing anything different. Just trying to shoot,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/roope-hintz/">Hintz</a> said. “Today, it went in.”</p>
        <p>MacKinnon’s power-play goal in the second made it 2-1 and arrived moments after a wild sequence. The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/colorado-avalanche/">Avalanche</a> thought they scored when Nazem Kadri dove to knock in a puck. Just before it went in, though, Compher and Andrew Cogliano collided to knock the net off its anchor. The official ruled it a goal, only to overturn the call on replay.</p>
        <p>Cogliano was sent to the penalty box for hooking and MacKinnon capitalized. He now has eight goals and 10 assists.</p>
        <p>Colorado remains without captain Gabriel Landeskog (out indefinitely with a lower-body injury) and forward Mikko Rantanen (week-to-week with a lower-body ailment). Gone with those two are a combined eight goals and 11 assists.</p>
        <p>“It’s tough,” rookie defenseman Cale Makar said. “At the end of the day, we have so much depth. I don’t think anybody’s really worried.”</p>
        <p>NOTES: <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dallas-stars/">Stars</a> D Andrej Sekera missed a second straight game after slamming into the boards behind the net last weekend. … Avs D Ryan Graves replaced Mark Barberio in the lineup. … F Colin Wilson (lower body) was a scratch. … Kadri picked up assist No. 200 in his NHL career. … Broncos pass rusher Bradley Chubb, who’s recovering from a torn ACL, was in attendance. … The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/colorado-avalanche/">Avalanche</a> posted on their Twitter account that Landeskog’s wife gave birth to a daughter earlier in the day.</p>
