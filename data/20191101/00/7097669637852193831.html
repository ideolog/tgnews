      <h1>Trump declares himself resident of Florida in move that could help him pay less tax, says report</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T00:31:31+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 00:31</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/" target="_blank">Andrew Buncombe</a></address>
      <p>The Queens-born <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a> - who has always prided himself as the ultimate <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/new-york">New Yorker</a> - is said to be declaring himself a <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/florida">Floridian</a> and possibly doing so for <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/taxes">tax reasons</a>.</p>
      <p>A report said papers filed with the Palm Beach county circuit court, revealed Mr Trump was switching his primary residence from Manhattan to Palm Beach.</p>
      <p>While Mr Trump long operated out of his Trump Tower penthouse as both a reality television star and a political candidate, since becoming president he has spent much more time at as Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.</p>
      <p>The <i>New York Times</i> said both Mr Trump and first lady Melania Trump, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/31/us/politics/trump-new-york-florida-primary-residence.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage">filed</a> a “declaration of domicile” saying Mar-a-Lago will now be their permanent residence.</p>
      <p>“If I maintain another place or places of abode in some other state or states, I hereby declare that my above-described residence and abode in the state of Florida constitutes my predominant and principal home, and I intend to continue it permanently as such,” said the filing.</p>
      <p>“I formerly resided at 721 Fifth Avenue.”</p>
      <p>It said he listed under “other places of abode”, 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, the address for the White House, and his private golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey.</p>
      <p>Since becoming president, he has spent a reported 99 days at Mar-a-Lago, and just 20 at Trump Tower.</p>
      <p>The White House did not immediately respond to enquiries on Thursday evening.</p>
      <p>The <i>New York Times</i> said the move may be being done for tax reasons.</p>
      <p>It said Florida, which does not have a state income tax or inheritance tax, “has long been a place for the wealthy to escape the higher taxes of the northeast”.</p>
      <p>It said the president had also been angered by efforts of officials in New York state to obtain copies of his tax returns.</p>
