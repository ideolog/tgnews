      <p><b>Topline: </b>Apple entered the streaming wars with much fanfare on Friday, announcing the launch of Apple TV+ as the first “<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-media-apple-appletv-idUSKBN1XB3TE">all-original</a>” streaming service, with a slate of high-budget new shows that it hopes can compete with rivals like Amazon, Netflix and Disney.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Apple TV+ <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-media-apple-appletv-idUSKBN1XB3TE">launched</a> in over 100 countries and territories on Friday, debuting four new TV series and several other offerings, with new programming to be added each month.</li>
        <li>At $4.99 per month, Apple has deliberately priced its service cheaper than other competitors—and anyone who purchased an Apple product after September 10 can get a free one-year subscription.</li>
        <li>With its early bet on a few original series, Apple is <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/dawnchmielewski/2019/10/31/apple-has-one-more-thing-to-add-to-its-product-mix--no-charging-required/#37335e7c689b">relying on big star power</a> to attract subscribers: One of its most heavily promoted programs, <i>The Morning Show</i>, stars Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon and Steve Carell.</li>
        <li>Other content released on Friday <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-media-apple-appletv-idUSKBN1XB3TE">includes</a>: <i>For All Mankind</i>, a science fiction drama imagining a world in which the Soviet Union wins the space race; <i>See</i>, a drama set in a dystopian future starring Jason Momoa; and <i>Dickinson</i>, a reimagining of poet Emily Dickinson in her teenage years.</li>
        <li>Apple TV+’s lack of library content <a href="https://apnews.com/165d8109c0c0444192c49f9880ceca5d">might put it at a disadvantage</a>, however: Unlike Netflix and the upcoming Disney+, Apple doesn’t have rights to a back catalog of TV shows and movies, making Apple TV+’s offerings slimmer than other online streaming  services.</li>
        <li>Apple will need to maximize its original content in order to compete with the wide offerings of rival services like HBO Max—which has rights to classics like <i>Friends</i> and <i>South Park</i> but also new spinoffs like the <i>Game of Thrones</i> prequel, <i>House of the Dragon</i>—and Disney+, with its vast library of popular franchises like <i>Star Wars</i>, Marvel and new spinoffs like <i>The Mandalorian</i>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Tangent:</b> A <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/danafeldman/2019/10/29/tv-time-uta-streaming-wars-study-6-new-services-exceeds-consumer-demand/#2262112b1fb0">recent study</a> of the new streaming landscape found that after Disney+ (88%), Apple TV+ had the highest levels of consumer awareness (63%), followed by HBO Max (37%)—slated for release in Spring 2020, and NBCU’s Peacock (28%)—releasing in April 2020.</p>
      <p><b>Big number: </b>In a recent note, Morgan Stanley analysts see big potential for Apple TV+, estimating that it could generate <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/23/apple-tv-will-become-a-9-billion-business-by-2025.html">$9 billion per year</a> in revenue by 2025—and that’s if just one out of every ten Apple users subscribes to the new service.</p>
      <p><b>Crucial quote:</b> “It’s a gift to our users and, from a business point of view, we’re really proud of the content,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said after the company’s <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2019/10/30/apple-earnings-beat-expectations-showing-recovery-from-trade-war-pressures/#1dffd20c1dc0">third-quarter earnings report</a> on Wednesday. “We’d like as many people as possible to view it. This allows us to focus on maximizing subscribers, particularly in the early going. We think it’s a bold move.”</p>
