      <h1>Yes, Mitt Romney's Grandson's Dressed as 'Pierre Delecto' For Halloween</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T00:27:57+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 00:27</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://time.com/author/abby-vesoulis/" target="_blank">Abby Vesoulis</a></address>
      <p>Political enthusiasts had some scary-good Halloween costumes this year, but the most “delectable” among them might have been that of Sen. Mitt Romney’s grandson, Thomas, who dressed as Pierre Delecto.</p>
      <p>Romney’s eldest son, Tagg Romney, took to Twitter Thursday morning with pictures of his son Thomas’s version of the look. The costume included a tuxedo, beret, mustache, sunglasses and a name-tag that read “Pierre Delecto” directly underneath a crossed-out “Mitt Romney.”</p>
      <p>Pierre Delecto was the name of the ‘private’ Twitter account Romney had, for years, been using for social media snooping and self-promotion, before it was recently uncovered by <i>Slate</i> reporter <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/10/mitt-romney-has-a-secret-twitter-account-and-it-sure-looks-like-its-this-one.html">Ashley Feinberg</a>. After the Utah Republican dropped hints about the account’s existence to the <i>Atlantic’s </i>McKay Coppins, Feinberg was able to identify the alias by parsing through the accounts Delecto followed (specifically, Romney family members with only a small Twitter presence themselves), as well as how often the account said nice things about Romney.</p>
      <p>Sen. Romney confirmed the account was his soon after <i>Slate</i>‘s exposé. “C’est moi,” he <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/10/mitt-romney-middle-impeachment-fight/600373/">told</a> Coppins.</p>
      <p>He seemed to find the costume as funny as the rest of the Internet did. “Out of the will!” Romney tweeted about Thomas in jest.</p>
      <p>As President Donald Trump is ensnared in a formal impeachment inquiry, and a record number of Democrats seek their party’s nomination for the 2020 presidential election, there were plenty of costume alternatives for those outside of the Romney bloodline: a Sen. Kamala Harris campaign staffer <a href="https://twitter.com/KamalaHarris/status/1190025342934769666">dressed as</a> her 2020 rival Sen. Cory Booker, <a href="https://twitter.com/jefflash/status/1189893607181950976">many donned whistles to represent</a> the government employee who filed an anonymous complaint that jumpstarted Trump’s impeachment woes, and one Pete Buttigieg staffer <a href="https://twitter.com/cmarinucci/status/1188272844985135104">used</a> a red peacoat and gavel to impersonate House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.</p>
