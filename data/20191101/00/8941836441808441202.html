      <h1>Tatum jumper lifts Celtics to 104-102 win over Knicks</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T00:00:00+00:00">01 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">DOUG ALDEN</a></address>
      <p>BOSTON (AP) - <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jayson-tatum/">Jayson Tatum</a> made a big play at a big moment for the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/boston-celtics/">Boston Celtics</a>.</p>
      <p>Then he made it sound very routine.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jayson-tatum/">Tatum</a> hit a turnaround jumper with 1.3 seconds remaining, and the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/boston-celtics/">Celtics</a> beat the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-york-knicks/">New York Knicks</a> 104-102 on Friday night for their fourth straight victory.</p>
      <p>“It feels great, but I don’t want to get too excited,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jayson-tatum/">Tatum</a> said. “The guys that I look up to in this league, they’ve do things like this all the time.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jayson-tatum/">Tatum</a> finished with 24 points. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kemba-walker/">Kemba Walker</a> scored 23 of his 33 points in the second half, and Gordon Hayward had 13 points and nine boards.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kemba-walker/">Walker</a> called <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jayson-tatum/">Tatum</a>’s basket “a huge, big-time shot.”</p>
      <p>“I’m happy we went to him,” he said. “Hopefully that keeps him confident. That can really just get something going for us. That was an unbelievable play.”</p>
      <p>Unlike a 118-95 rout at Madison Square Garden the previous Saturday, Boston was pushed by New York until the very end of a game that featured 24 lead changes and 10 ties.</p>
      <p>Marcus Morris, who played the last two seasons with the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/boston-celtics/">Celtics</a> before signing with New York as a free agent, led the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-york-knicks/">Knicks</a> with 29 points. Morris made four foul shots in the final minute, and then hit a tying 3-pointer with 4.7 seconds left.</p>

        <p>“We stayed locked in all game long,” said <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-york-knicks/">Knicks</a> rookie RJ Barrett, who finished with 15 points and seven rebounds. “The whole fourth quarter we was fighting, and that’s the identity of our team. We did that tonight.”</p>
        <p>After Morris’ late 3, the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/boston-celtics/">Celtics</a> called timeout and Marcus Smart inbounded the ball to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jayson-tatum/">Tatum</a> in the corner. He caught the pass, turned around and pulled up for a shot from the corner that was initially called a 3-pointer. It was quickly overturned during the timeout, but it didn’t matter. The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/boston-celtics/">Celtics</a> broke up a long inbound pass and the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-york-knicks/">Knicks</a> didn’t get off another shot.</p>
        <p>Morris congratulated his former teammate after the game.</p>
        <p>“It was good to see him get his first one (game-winning shot),” Morris said. “I wish it could have been against somebody else, but hey - it’s the NBA.”</p>
        <p>WELCOME WALKER</p>
        <p>It was the third straight game with 30-plus points by <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kemba-walker/">Walker</a>, who scored 32 in the previous two and finished with his best game since signing with the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/boston-celtics/">Celtics</a> as a free agent.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kemba-walker/">Walker</a> also hit all 14 of his foul shots and added five assists and six rebounds.</p>
        <p>“We stuck with the game,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kemba-walker/">Walker</a> said. “It came down to a last-second shot, but (we’ll) take wins any way you can get them.”</p>
        <p>LONG BALL</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-york-knicks/">Knicks</a> led 50-49 at halftime and opened the third quarter with a 3-pointer by Frank Ntilikina, starting a period full of shots from beyond the arc. Both clubs hit five 3-pointers in the quarter before the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/boston-celtics/">Celtics</a> carried a 75-74 lead into the fourth.</p>
        <p>The back-and-forth continued in the final period. Boston regained the lead on a three-point play by <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kemba-walker/">Walker</a>, putting the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/boston-celtics/">Celtics</a> up 87-86 with 5:19 remaining.</p>
        <p>Hayward followed with a 3-pointer and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jayson-tatum/">Tatum</a> hit a pair of foul shots to stretch the lead to 92-86 with 4:14 left to play. The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-york-knicks/">Knicks</a> pulled within a point at 92-91, then again at 95-94 on a 3-pointer by Morris, but the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/boston-celtics/">Celtics</a> answered with a pair of free throws by <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kemba-walker/">Walker</a> and a 3-pointer by <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jayson-tatum/">Tatum</a> with 1:50 remaining, giving Boston a 99-94 lead.</p>
