      <p>WASHINGTON (AP) - Two days after winning their first World Series title, the Washington Nationals declined a $4 million mutual option for 2020 on backup first baseman <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/matt-adams/">Matt Adams</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/matt-adams/">Adams</a> gets a $1 million buyout and becomes a free agent following Friday’s decision.</p>
      <p>The 31-year-old hit .226 with 20 homers and 56 RBIs in 111 games during the regular season.</p>
      <p>He had just four plate appearances in the postseason and his only World Series action was a walk as a pinch hitter in Game 3. His pinch single off Adam Wainwright sparked a two-run rally in Game 2 of the NL Championship Series.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/matt-adams/">Adams</a>, 31, is an eight-year big league veteran with St. Louis (2012-17, ‘18), Atlanta (2017) and Washington (2018, ‘19).</p>
