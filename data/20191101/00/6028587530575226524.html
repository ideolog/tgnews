      <p><b>Topline:</b> Almost 80% of Chinese shoppers said in a new survey that they will boycott American goods during Singles’ Day—the world’s largest online shopping event—on November 11, as the ongoing U.S.-China trade war increasingly gives rise to nationalistic sentiment that is trickling into the retail industry.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Up to 78% of Chinese shoppers said they would avoid buying American brands and instead opt for Chinese products, according to a <a href="https://www.alixpartners.com/media/13567/singles-day-report-china-2019.pdf">recent survey</a> from global consulting firm AlixPartners that was <a href="https://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/3035584/chinese-shoppers-say-they-would-shun-american-brands-during">first reported</a> on by the <i>South China Morning Post</i>.</li>
        <li>More than half of the 2,000 respondents cited “patriotism” as the main reason for doing so, according to AlixPartners’ survey, showing a <a href="https://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/3035584/chinese-shoppers-say-they-would-shun-american-brands-during">rise in nationalistic attitudes</a> amid the backdrop of the U.S.-China trade war.</li>
        <li>Singles’ Day, or Double 11, is a 24-hour online shopping festival on Alibaba’s Taobao, Tmall and AliExpress platforms; it is the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/alibaba-singles-day-2018-biggest-online-shopping-day-2018-11">biggest e-commerce event</a> in the world, larger than Amazon Prime Day, Black Friday and Cyber Monday combined.</li>
        <li>If shoppers do boycott American goods as expected, that would primarily hurt U.S. consumer brands like Nike, Tapestry Inc., Ralph Lauren, Capri Holdings and Tiffany &amp; Co.</li>
        <li>While most respondents said they would pass up American brands, they <a href="https://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/3035584/chinese-shoppers-say-they-would-shun-american-brands-during">won’t be discouraged</a> from choosing other foreign brands from places like Europe, Japan and South Korea, according to the survey.</li>
        <li>Despite the effects of the trade war, Chinese consumers in big cities are expected to spend 54% more year-over-year on Singles’ Day, according to the survey.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Big numbers:</b> In 2018, Black Friday sales amounted to $6.2 billion, Cyber Monday sales hit $7.9 billion and shoppers spent <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-07-19/amazon-prime-day-shopping-topped-4-billion-analyst-estimates">roughly $4.2 billion</a> on Amazon Prime Day—but <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/black-friday-cyber-monday-vs-singles-day-sales-2018-12">none of those come close</a> to the $30.8 billion of transactions (in gross merchandise volume) spent on Alibaba’s Singles’ Day last year.</p>
      <p><b>Crucial quote:</b> “Chinese consumers … prefer local brands, and the recent rise in pro-China feeling has only pushed this further,” AlixPartners’ director Jason Ong <a href="https://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/3035584/chinese-shoppers-say-they-would-shun-american-brands-during">said</a> in the <i>South China Morning Post</i>.</p>
