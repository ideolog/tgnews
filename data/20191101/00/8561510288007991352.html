      <h1>The Life Expectancy for American Men Keeps Falling</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T00:00:00+00:00">01 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Dan Robitzski</a></address>
      <p>The life expectancy of American men appears to have peaked, and is now steadily declining.</p>
      <p>The difference is modest — the average life expectancy declined a total of about four months since 2014, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/life-expectancy-for-american-men-drops-for-a-third-year/">according to <i>CBS News</i></a>. But while the actual difference is small, the fact that it’s <a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/us-life-expectancy-birth-drops-second-consecutive-year">declined every year</a> between 2014 and 2017 — the latest year for which data is available — is a troubling sign.</p>
      <p>According to <i>CBS</i>, the rising mortality rate is explained in part by rising death rates from drug overdoses, deaths by suicide, and alcohol-related diseases like cirrhosis.</p>
      <p>The life expectancy change isn’t hitting everyone equally — previous research suggests college graduates are <a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/life-expectancy-educated-americans">actually living longer</a> than before.</p>
      <p>And because some people are living longer, the small shift in the life expectancy actually masks the scale of the problem. <i>CBS</i> reports that the percent of adult American men who die from drug overdose doubled over the ten years between 2007 and 2017.</p>
      <p>The distinction is likely linked to class — earning a degree doesn’t magically give anyone a clean bill of health. Because American health care can be prohibitively expensive, <i>CBS</i> reports, an increasing number of poor Americans are delaying or skipping medical checkups and treatments.</p>
