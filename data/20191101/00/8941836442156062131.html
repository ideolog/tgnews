      <h1>Beto O’Rourke’s dashed White House dreams trolled by NRA:</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T00:00:00+00:00">01 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/staff/douglas-ernst/" target="_blank">Douglas Ernst</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/national-rifle-association/">National Rifle Association</a> wasted no time on Friday trolling Beto O’Rourke’s failed presidential dreams by referencing his “Hell yes!” response on the idea of AR-15 confiscations.</p>
      <p>“Beto O’Rourke has dropped out of the 2020 presidential race. That makes it two failed campaigns in one year!” the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/national-rifle-association/">NRA</a> tweeted after Mr. O’Rourke ended his campaign. “Let this be a lesson: Running on destroying the Second Amendment and stripping Americans of their firearms is never a good idea. #ByeBeto.”</p>
      <p>The gun rights organization’s tweet also included an image that read “Hell yes. Beto Fails,” with the former Texas representative giving a “thumbs up” sign.</p>
      <p>Mr. O’Rourke captured national headlines in September when he exclaimed, “Hell, yes, we’re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47,” on a Texas debate stage with  his fellow presidential hopefuls.</p>
      <p>“We’re not going to allow it to be used against our fellow Americans anymore,” the Democrat said.</p>

      <p>Mr. O’Rourke’s campaign exit was punctuated by a call to “fearlessly champion the issues and causes that brought us together,” and to end an “epidemic of gun violence” and “structural racism.”</p>
