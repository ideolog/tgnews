      <p>Coal Minister Pralhad Joshi onÂ November 1 asked mining major <a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/mining-minerals/coalindia/CI11">Coal India Ltd</a> to fast track its ambitious one billion tonne production target and look to achieve the goal by 2023-24.</p>
      <p>The state-owned company had earlier said it would meet the target by the fiscal 2025-26.</p>
      <p>"You (CIL) will have to fast track the one billion tonne target to 2023-24, as the current growth is not enough. There is no question of 2025-26. I will ensure all support to CIL in this endeavour," Joshi said.</p>
