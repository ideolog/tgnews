      <h1>Not The Best Deal: Albemarle Pays $1.3 Billion For A Lithium Asset— And Closes It</h1>

      <p>Too much lithium and not enough demand for the battery-making material have hit the Australian expansion plans of U.S.-based specialty chemical maker Albemarle Corporation which effectively acquired, and closed, a new mine on the same day.The deal to buy a stake in the Wodgina lithium mine in Western Australia was first negotiated 12 months ago, a time when lithium prices were higher and demand for the electric vehicles which use it in their batteries was forecast to be stronger than it is.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Celebrations Turn Sour</b>
      </p>
      <p>Rather than celebrating the deal today turned into commiserations with the workforce sent home and the almost new mine put in mothballs.</p>

      <p>As a warning about the slow uptake of electric vehicles (EVs) the Wodgina experience is a prime example of getting business priorities in the correct order which, in this case, mean make sure you can sell what you propose to produce.</p>
      <p>Located in the remote Pilbara region of Australia, Wodgina is a mine once best known for producing tantalum which is used in electronic appliances such as cell phones, with lithium originally treated as a nuisance until demand grew from battery makers.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately for Albemarle and its Australian partner in Wodgina, a company called Mineral Resources, they plunged into a joint venture at a bad time, just before the price of lithium started to collapse.</p>
      <p>Because it is sold in multiple forms the market for lithium is opaque but as a guide the price of a widely-traded material called lithium carbonate has fallen by more than 60% since the start of the year, from $22,000 a ton to $8500/t.</p>
      <p>While other mines and lithium processing plants have also closed or slowed output the Wodgina experience is unique in that it is the heart of a deal designed to cement Albemarle’s leadership in the Australian lithium industry where it already has a half-share in the high-class Greenbushes mine.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Closed Until The Market Improves</b>
      </p>
      <p>The chief executive of Albemarle, Luke Kissam, said in a statement that a decision had been made to idle the Wodgina mine until market conditions improve.</p>
      <p>The irony of Kissam’s statement is that it started by announcing the closure of the transaction with Mineral Resources that has two stages, firstly a cash payment of $820 million to the Australian company for 60% of the mine and secondly the transfer of a 40% interest in two lithium hydroxide conversion trains to Mineral Resources which took the total value of the transaction up to $1.3 billion.</p>
      <p>But the next comment was the Wodgina closure.</p>
      <p>“Based on current market conditions, the Wodgina mine will idle production until market demand supports bringing the mine back into production,” Albemarle said.</p>
      <p>Albemarle’s share price on the New York Stock Exchange has fallen by $4.50 over the past week to $60.74, and is down by $44.70 (42%) since this time last year.</p>
