      <h1>South Dakota H.S. football team wins 103-0, legislature might get invo</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T00:00:00+00:00">01 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/staff/christopher-vondracek/" target="_blank">Christopher Vondracek</a></address>
      <p>An undefeated high school team from Pierre, South Dakota, posted a hundred points against a playoff opponent — in football. Now a state legislator says the public wants action.</p>
      <p>“People walking in my office want legislation to fix the @<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/south-dakota-high-school-activities-association/">SDHSAA</a> so another blowout Pierre/Spearfish 103-0 football game doesn’t occur,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/fred-deutsch/">Rep. Fred Deutsch</a>, a Republican, tweeted Friday morning.</p>
      <p>On Thursday’s playoff quarterfinals for 11AA, Spearfish High School brought its 0-9 record to undefeated Pierre T.F. Riggs High School, which bested the team 72-0 just a month earlier. By halftime, Pierre led 75-0, ultimately winning 103-0.</p>
      <p>The number of 11-man high school students playing football in South Dakota has fallen by 15% over the last decade, according to national tracking data, but the number of divisions has ballooned to seven, including four groupings for 11-man football and three for 9-man. By comparison, neighboring Wyoming has five divisions.</p>
      <p>More classifications has meant fewer teams per classification — and, critics charge, lopsided competition. Only 10 teams comprise South Dakota’s 11AA division.</p>

      <p>In a response on Twitter, the executive director of the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/south-dakota-high-school-activities-association/">South Dakota High School Activities Association</a> dismissed <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/fred-deutsch/">Mr. Deutsch</a>’s call for legislative action, saying he’d instead look to implement a mercy rule and reconsider current classifications.</p>
