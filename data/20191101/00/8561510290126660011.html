      <h1>ACLU Sues FBI For “Dystopian Surveillance Technology” Info</h1>

      <h3>ACLU Lawsuit</h3>
      <p>In January, the American Civil Liberties Union submitted a Freedom of Information Act request to the Justice Department (DOJ), the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), and the FBI asking for any policies, contracts, or records related to the agencies’ use of surveillance tech, such as facial recognition software.</p>
      <p>None of the agencies have turned over that information willingly — so the ACLU is now suing them for it.</p>
      <h3>Fess Up</h3>
      <p>The ACLU filed a <a href="https://www.aclu.org/legal-document/aclu-v-doj-face-recognition-surveillance-complaint">lawsuit</a> in Massachusetts on Thursday, asking a federal court to force the agencies to hand over the information.</p>
      <p>“This dystopian surveillance technology threatens to fundamentally alter our free society into one where we’re treated as suspects to be tracked and monitored by the government 24/7,” Kade Crockford, a director at the ACLU office in Massachusetts, wrote in a <a href="https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/aclu-challenges-fbi-face-recognition-secrecy">post</a> announcing the lawsuit.</p>
      <p>Both the DEA and the FBI <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/10/31/aclu-sues-fbi-doj-over-facial-recognition-technology-criticizing-unprecedented-surveillance-secrecy/">told <i>The Washington Post</i></a> they “don’t comment on pending litigation,” while the DOJ declined to comment.</p>
      <h3>Known Unknown</h3>
      <p>The ACLU has been one of the most <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/amazon-rekognition-falsely-matched-congresspeople">vocal critics</a> of facial recognition tech, but it’s far from alone in opposing its use. <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/oakland-ban-facial-recognition">Three U.S. cities</a> have already prohibited their law enforcement agencies from using the tech, and presidential candidate Bernie Sanders has called for a <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/bernie-sanders-ban-police-facial-recognition">full federal ban</a> on it.</p>
      <p>Still, while we know at least a few places where facial recognition tech isn’t being used, we don’t know for sure everywhere that it is — and hopefully, this ACLU lawsuit will clear up that mystery.</p>
