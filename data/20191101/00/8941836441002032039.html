      <p>SINSHEIM, Germany (AP) - Hoffenheim defeated struggling Paderborn 3-0 at home to stretch its winning run in the Bundesliga to four games on Friday.</p>
      <p>Robert Skov opened the scoring with a free kick in the second minute and was involved in the buildup as Pavel Kaderabek made it 2-0 in the 15th. Kaderabek then set up Jürgen Locadia for the third in the 28th.</p>
      <p>Paderborn made two changes at the break but labored to break through with Hoffenheim content to defend its lead.</p>
      <p>Paderborn, promoted after finishing second in the second division last season, looks set for a swift return with eight defeats from its opening 10 games.</p>
      <p>Hoffenheim, which kicked off its winning run with a 2-1 away victory over defending champion Bayern Munich, moved to fifth ahead of the rest of the 10th round.</p>
