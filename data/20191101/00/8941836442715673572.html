      <p>MEXICO CITY (AP) - The Mexican state of Baja California Sur will start charging a tax equivalent to about $18.50 for each foreign tourist who visits.</p>
      <p>The state is home to resort cities like Cabo San Lucas, San Jose del Cabo and La Paz.</p>
      <p>The state government said Friday it will begin charging the tax starting Nov. 9.</p>
      <p>Other Mexican cities charge tourists indirectly through hotel or airport-use taxes.</p>
      <p>But the Baja Sur tax will be charged directly to tourists and will be payable at kiosks located at airports.</p>

      <p>The state said the tax is for “use of Infrastructure” and will be used for “social service works.”</p>
