      <p>HILO, Hawaii (AP) - The latest version of proposed administrative rules for the Big Island summit where a giant telescope is planned to be built have been released.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/hawaii-tribune/">Hawaii Tribune</a>-Herald reports Friday that the new proposal was released along with a meeting plan.</p>
      <p>The rules for Hawaii’s Mauna Kea have been a point of contention for some Native Hawaiians, including those opposed to the construction of the new telescope.</p>
      <p>The University of Hawaii, which manages the land, says the rules are meant to “provide for the proper use, management and protection of cultural, natural, and scientific resources.”</p>
      <p>Some who oppose the proposed rules say they could impede Hawaiian cultural practices and access to the summit. Protesters have been blocking telescope construction for months.</p>

      <p>The Board of Regents will consider the proposal next week.</p>
