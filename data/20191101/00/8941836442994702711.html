      <p>TOKYO (AP) - Fire and police investigators are inspecting the burned-out ruins of Shuri Castle on Okinawa to determine the cause of the fire that nearly destroyed the site that is a symbol of the Japanese island’s cultural heritage and history of struggle.</p>
      <p>The fire Thursday burned down the castle’s three main halls and four nearby structures. It took firefighters 11 hours to extinguish the fire.</p>
      <p>More than 130 investigators were inspecting the site Friday. Fire officials believe the fire started inside the Seiden, the castle’s centerpiece, around 2:30 a.m. when nobody was around.</p>
