      <p>DAYTON, Ohio (AP) - Authorities say a joint task force in Ohio has seized a quantity of suspected fentanyl large enough to kill the state’s population “many times over.”</p>
      <p>A Montgomery County sheriff’s news release says law enforcement recently confiscated over 20 kilograms, or more than 40 pounds, of suspected fentanyl. Investigators also seized quantities of suspected methamphetamine and heroin, firearms and more than $30,000.</p>
      <p>Authorities say three Dayton men face charges including possession with intent to distribute 400 or more grams of fentanyl.</p>
      <p>Vance Callender, Homeland Security Investigations special agent in charge for Michigan and Ohio, said 20 kilograms of fentanyl is “enough to kill the entire population of Ohio, many times over.”</p>

        <p>Republican Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost said that much fentanyl amounts to “chemical warfare and a weapon of mass destruction.”</p>
