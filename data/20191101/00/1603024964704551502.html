      <p>The country's largest car maker <a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/auto-cars-jeeps/marutisuzukiindia/MS24">Maruti Suzuki India</a>Â saw its October sales rise 4.5 percent year-on-year led by compact and utility vehicle segments, while month-on-month growth was pretty high at 25.4 percent driven by festive season sales and heavy discounts.</p>
      <p>The company sold 1.53 lakh units during October against 1.46 lakh units sold in same month last year. However, the number came in lower than Nomura's expectation of 1.7 lakh units.</p>
      <p>In fact, the growth was strong compared to a decline seen in the past several months due to weak demand.</p>
