      <p>ROANOKE, Va. (AP) - Nearly 5,000 acres (2,023 hectares) of woodlands in northern Botetourt County is to become part of the Jefferson National Forest.</p>
      <p>The Roanoke Times reports the U.S. Forest Service used money from the federal Land and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/water-conservation-fund/">Water Conservation Fund</a> to buy the property in what it calls one of the largest purchases for conservation in Virginia.</p>
      <p>The $5 million purchase was made possible earlier this year by a vote in Congress to reauthorize the Land and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/water-conservation-fund/">Water Conservation Fund</a>, a $900 million program that uses royalties from offshore oil and gas drilling to pay for protection of unspoiled lands.</p>
      <p>The land, which includes 14 freshwater springs, borders Craig Creek and also includes the Grace Furnace, a historic pig iron facility that likely provided iron ore for munitions during the Civil War.</p>
