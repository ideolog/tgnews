      <p>Violence in Ethiopia began last week with <a href="https://sputniknews.com/africa/201906241076035527-it-has-africas-most-thriving-economy-but-could-ethnic-tensions-shatter-ethiopia/">protests against Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed</a> and quickly turned into ethnic clashes. Protests broke out in the capital, Addis Ababa, and in much of Ethiopia’s Oromia region after a Facebook post by activist Jawar Mohammed. He accused security forces of trying to conspire an attack against him at his home – a claim that police officials denied.</p>
      <p>Abiy is the country's first leader representing the Oromo group, the largest ethnic group in Ethiopia. Earlier this month, he <a href="https://sputniknews.com/world/201910111077020146-ethiopia-prime-minister-2019-nobel-peace-prize/">won the Nobel Peace Prize</a> for his role in ending the 20-year war between Ethiopia and Eritrea.</p>
      <p>Mohammed, who also represents the Oromo group, stated that the minister acted like a dictator while implementing the major institutional reforms and policies since April 2018.</p>
