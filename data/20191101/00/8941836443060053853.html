      <p>TOKYO (AP) - United States hooker Joe Taufete’e is a surprise inclusion on the six-man shortlist for World Rugby’s Player of the Year award for 2019.</p>
      <p>Taufete’e became the most prolific try-scorer in international history by a front-row forward, his hat trick against Uruguay in March taking him to 18 in his first 21 in tests - beating the record held by Ireland hooker Keith Wood. He was also the top try-scorer in the Americas Rugby Championship, with six.</p>
      <p>Three players who will take the field for the Rugby World Cup final on Saturday, England flanker Tom Curry and South Africans Cheslin Kolbe and Pieter-Steph du Toit, are also up for the award, as are Wales lock Alun Wyn Jones and New Zealand flanker Ardie Savea.</p>
      <p>The winner will be announced in Tokyo on Sunday.</p>
