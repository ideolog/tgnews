      <p>(CNN) - More than 600,000 four-wheel drive trucks and SUVs are being recalled by General Motors because a software error could trigger the braking system and increase the likelihood of a crash, The Associated Press reported Thursday.</p>
      <p>Covered are the 2014-2018 Chevrolet Silverado 1500, the 2015-2020 Chevrolet Suburban, the 2015-2020 Chevrolet Tahoe, the 2014-2018 GMC Sierra 1500 and the 2015-2020 GMC Yukon models.</p>
      <p>GM said more than 650,000 vehicles worldwide are potentially affected, the AP reported. No accidents have been reported.</p>
      <p>The failure of a wheel-speed sensor can activate the braking software, leading to unintended braking on the opposite wheel, the AP said, causing the vehicle to pull to one side.</p>
      <p>The risk can be eliminated by driving in two-wheel drive mode until the recall repair is made, GM told the wire service.</p>
      <p>The reprogramming of the vehiclesâ€™ software will be done by GM free of charge.</p>
