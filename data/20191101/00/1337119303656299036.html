      <h1>Netflix plans to release its first scripted podcast</h1>
      <h2><i>The Only Podcast</i> Left comes out November 7th</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T00:10:00+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 00:10</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/ashley-carman" target="_blank">Ashley Carman</a></address>
      <p>Netflix is branching out beyond scripted video and nonfiction podcasts to create fictional podcasts. The company <a href="https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/netflix-daybreak-podcast-1203388868/">said today</a> it’s planning to release a show called <i>The Only Podcast Left </i>as a fictional companion to its new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20921033/daybreak-review-netflix-series-apocalypse-teen-comedy-zombies-colin-ford-launch-date">apocalyptic zombie show <i>Daybreak</i></a>. The podcast takes place in <i>Daybreak</i>’s universe and tells the story of a group of teens who make a podcast during the apocalypse. It’ll exclusively be available through Spotify until December 12th, which is when it’ll be released on other platforms.</p>
      <p>Netflix already produces companion podcasts for some of its content, including a behind-the-scenes show about <i>Stranger Things</i>, and another called <i>You Can’t Make This Up</i> about how Netflix filmmakers create their true crime dramas. Other video content platforms are also dabbling in podcasts. HBO <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/23/18714335/the-chernobyl-podcast-hbo-peter-sagal-craig-mazin-wait-wait-dont-tell-me-interview">created a companion show for <i>Chernobyl</i></a>, for instance, and CBS Studios plans to release a <i>Star Trek </i>companion show.</p>
      <p>The big idea with these programs so far has been a bit of fan service and in some cases giving people a place to learn more about the process behind their favorite shows. With this newest show, however, Netflix is expanding a proprietary narrative universe. Podcasts are cheaper, easier, and less time-intensive to produce than video content, so it makes sense studios would try them as a strategy to further bring people into their world. It’s low-risk, high-reward.w</p>
