      <p>TUALATIN, Ore. (AP) - District officials say three Tualatin High School students were recently diagnosed with whooping cough.</p>
      <p>Those cases add to one at <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/northeast-portland/">Northeast Portland</a>’s Grant High School, where a student was diagnosed with the illness earlier this week.</p>
      <p>Washington County has seen 36 confirmed or suspected cases of the illness so far this year, county health department spokeswoman Wendy Gordon told The Oregonian/OregonLive.</p>
      <p>Whooping cough, or pertussis, causes severe, violent coughing and spreads easily in groups.</p>
      <p>Other signs include cold-like symptoms like a runny nose but usually no fever.</p>
