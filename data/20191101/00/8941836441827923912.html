      <p>MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) - The Latest on the dispute within Alabama’s Democratic Party (all times local):</p>
      <p>6:25 p.m.</p>
      <p>A Montgomery judge has blocked a meeting of a faction of the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/alabama-democratic-party/">Alabama Democratic Party</a>’s executive committee that’s scheduled to hold leadership elections Saturday.</p>
      <p>The Montgomery Advertiser reports Circuit Judge Greg Griffin wrote in an opinion delivered about 5 p.m. Friday that the court is satisfied plaintiffs have at least a reasonable chance of prevailing upon, at a minimum, the key question of which set of bylaws constitute the current and valid bylaws.</p>
      <p>Barry Ragsdale, an attorney for the faction seeking to hold the election, said in an email Friday that they would file an appeal and a request an emergency stay with the Alabama Supreme Court.</p>

      <p>SDEC members are set to begin their meeting at 8 a.m. Saturday. Ragsdale argued in court Thursday that granting the injunction would violate his clients’ First Amendment rights to assembly.</p>

      <p>The chairman of the Democratic National Committee is backing plan to elect new leadership for Alabama’s beleaguered Democratic Party.</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p>A statement filed in court by the head of the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/alabama-democratic-party/">national party</a>, Tom Perez, says a party meeting planned for Saturday to elect new leaders complies with rules.</p>
        <p>The current chair of the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/alabama-democratic-party/">party</a>, Nancy Worley, and others have filed suit to block the meeting. They contend it would be improper.</p>
        <p>A judge is considering their request following a hearing.</p>
        <p>Insurgents seeking new leadership are aligned with Alabama’s only Democratic statewide officeholder, Sen. Doug Jones. Jones says he’s supporting state Rep. Chris England for chair.</p>
        <p>Perez’s statement says Alabama likely won’t get to send representatives to the Democratic National Convention next year without changes approved by the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/alabama-democratic-party/">national party</a>.</p>
