      <h1>Bitcoin Price Slides 2% After Deribit, Coinbase Flash Crash</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T00:37:35+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 00:37</time> by <a rel="author">Sebastian Sinclair</a></address>
      <p><b>Update (Nov. 1, 15:03 UTC): </b>Deribit will <a href="https://twitter.com/DeribitExchange/status/1190047067365953536?s=20">reimburse</a> over $1.3 million in losses from the BTC index calculation data issue witnessed at 21:00:00 UTC on October 31, 2019.</p>

      <p>Another flash crash has occurred for bitcoin (BTC), this time appearing on the Coinbase Pro and Deribit exchanges.</p>
      <p>At 19:55 UTC on Oct. 31, BTC’s spot price dipped from $9,260 to $9,055 in quick succession on Coinbase’s exchange for professional traders.</p>
      <p>An hour later, Deribit, a futures and options exchange for BTC, saw futures prices drop from $9,150 to $7,720 before bouncing back above $9,000 within minutes.</p>
      <p>The move caught traders unawares as multiple orders were executed in the process.</p>
      <p>Crypto trader @Crypto_boy1 took to Twitter to <a href="https://twitter.com/Crypto_Boy1/status/1190032448236793857?s=20">slam</a> Deribit for telling customers that trades would not be rolled back and that they should manage positions accordingly.</p>
      <p>“It’s over. I would withdraw all funds and never use this exchange again If I was a user” he said.</p>

      <p>As seen above, BTC dropped to a low of $7,720 on Deribit, sending shock waves throughout the derivatives market. Liquidations shot through the roof on Bitmex, for example.</p>

      <p>However, in an <a href="https://twitter.com/DeribitExchange/status/1190038937542283270?s=20">official response</a> on the same thread, Deribit said it would attempt to rectify the incident by changing the price of stop-loss trades to a fixed BTC level, depending on the product.</p>
      <p>“Equity will be brought back to the pre-incident level, around index price $9,160,” the exchange said.</p>

      <p>An hour before Deribit’s incident, Coinbase Pro users also experienced problems as stop-loss orders were “deleted” right before BTC’s sharp drop from $9,260 to $9,055.</p>
      <p>According to a user of CoinDesk’s <a href="https://stocktwits.com/r/CoinDeskDojo/">Dojo</a> trading forum who goes by the handle Radyohead, the price dropped below their stop-loss order, yet no sale was executed:</p>
      <blockquote>“Coinbase crashed as far as I can see. And it deleted my Stop Loss as it happened, nothing sold for me despite the price being lower than where my stop was.”</blockquote>
      <p>Prices have since rebounded, currently changing hands for $9,145, while the issues on both exchanges appear to be <a href="https://status.pro.coinbase.com/incidents/t8h1h46npdmd">resolved</a>.</p>
