        <b>ANALYSIS/OPINION:</b>
      </p>
      <p>America’s economy saw the addition of 128,000 jobs this past October, a figure that <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm">surpassed</a> expectations of 75,000. And unemployment came in at 3.6%. And all the Democrats went — oh crap.</p>
      <p>This is why impeach, impeach, impeach is such a must-be, must-have, must-do for the left.</p>
      <p>Even the normal spinmeisters in the media can’t spin away the positives of the President <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Donald Trump</a> economy.</p>
      <p>“The U.S. added 128,000 jobs in October, topping dour forecasts,” CNN Business <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/01/economy/october-jobs-report/index.html">wrote</a>, in a headline above a story that went so far as to clarify, truthfully, why the unemployment rate rose a bit in recent weeks.</p>
      <p>“[T]he unemployment rate rose slightly to 3.6&amp;, but it was for good reason: 325,000 Americans started looking for work,” CNN Business reported.</p>
      <hr/>
      <hr/>
      <p>What? No crowing about a rising unemployment rate? No squawking of this depressed and depressing <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a> economy?</p>
      <p>“Overall,” the outlet went on, “the report was far stronger than expected, beating economists’ forecasts for a gain in 89,000 jobs.”</p>
      <p>NBC News, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/economy-added-128-000-jobs-october-beating-expectations-75-000-n1074816">put</a> the good news this way: “Economy added 128,000 jobs in October, beating expectations of 75,000.”</p>
      <p>Where’s the snark, guys?</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p>Where’s the bark?</p>
        <p>From the Los Angeles Times: “U.S. employers <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2019-11-01/october-jobs-report">added</a> a solid 128,000 jobs in October.”</p>
        <p>From ABC: “U.S. <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Business/us-adds-higher-expected-128000-jobs-october/story?id=66686572">adds</a> a higher than expected 128,000 jobs in October.”</p>
        <p>From Bloomberg: “U.S. Hiring Resilient With 128,000 Gain, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-01/u-s-hiring-resilient-with-128-000-gain-despite-strike-census">Validating</a> Fed Pause.”</p>
        <p>Of course, there was still this, from The Washington Post — Old Reliable on the Ding Trump Front: “U.S. economy <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/11/01/us-economy-added-jobs-october-gm-strike-displaced-workers-jobless-rate-ticks-up-percent/">added</a> 128,000 jobs in October, despite the GM strike. The jobless rate ticked up to 3.6 percent.”</p>
        <p>But that’s predictable.</p>
        <p>There always has to be one, right?</p>
        <p>Fact is, the economy’s chugging — it’s been chugging, since exit, stage left, Barack Obama days — and contrary to what Democrats would like believed, it’s only on a steady path to continue chugging.</p>
        <p>So what’s a desperate campaigner of the left to do?</p>
        <p>Climb aboard the impeachment train. Choo, choo, that’s what the left’s got to chug into 2020.</p>
        <p>“Public’s 2019 Priorities: Economy, Health Care, Education and Security All Near Top of List,” Pew Research Center <a href="https://www.people-press.org/2019/01/24/publics-2019-priorities-economy-health-care-education-and-security-all-near-top-of-list/">wrote</a> in January.</p>
        <p>Before that, it was this from Gallup, in 2018: “Healthcare, the economy and immigration top a list of issues that voters <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/244367/top-issues-voters-healthcare-economy-immigration.aspx">consider</a> important to their vote for Congress.”</p>
        <p>Poll Democrats by themselves, though, and the priorities shift a bit.</p>
        <p>FiveThirtyEight, in a September survey that <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-issues-should-the-2020-democratic-candidates-be-talking-about/">asked</a>, “What Issues Should The 2020 Democratic Candidates Be Talking About?” — found: “Democrats are most concerned about defeating President <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a> — nearly 40 percent of respondents said this was their top issue. For reference, the next-most-common top issue — health care — was picked by just 10 percent voters.”</p>
        <p>That means Democrats care more about booting <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a> than keeping an economy that’s obviously working well for the country.</p>
        <p>Impeach, impeach, impeach.</p>
        <p>The better the economy booms, the more positive the job numbers turn, the louder, wilder, crazier and frantic the impeachment calls will grow.</p>
