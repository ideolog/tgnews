      <p>It’s been a while since we’ve heard a proper new Miguel song. The R&amp;B singer’s most recent album is 2017’s <i><a href="https://www.stereogum.com/1972869/album-of-the-week-miguel-war-leisure/franchises/album-of-the-week/">War &amp; Leisure</a></i>. Earlier this year, he put out a <a href="https://music.apple.com/au/album/te-lo-dije-ep/1458039938">new EP</a> featuring Spanish-language versions of some of the tracks off of that album, but otherwise he’s been quiet outside of <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2058517/alicia-keys-show-me-love-feat-miguel/music/">a collaboration</a> with Alicia Keys that came out in September.</p>
      <p>But tonight Miguel has returned with a brand-new track called “Funeral.” It’s a quick one, but does a good job at getting you hyped for whatever Miguel might have in the pipeline. “Send my regards to the mother and father/ ‘Cause somebody’s daughter I just fucking slayed,” he sings in the grim chorus. “Blood on the carpet, it came from my heart/ Once I start, I can’t stop it, and now we are prey.”</p>
