      <h1>Ellen Burstyn talks women in film, Pacino interview, #MeToo</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T00:00:00+00:00">01 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">JOHN CARUCCI</a></address>
      <p>NEW YORK (AP) - <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ellen-burstyn/">Ellen Burstyn</a> hoped her Oscar-winning performance in the 1974 film in “Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore” would lead to more Hollywood stories told from a woman’s perspective.</p>
      <p>It didn’t happen quickly, but over the past couple of years there’s been an increase in female-driven films and women’s voices in the wake of the #MeToo movement that has put a spotlight on sexual misconduct.</p>
      <p>The 86-year old actress and long advocate for women calls the impact of the #MeToo movement “a long time coming” and says boundaries of what’s acceptable creatively still need to be worked out.</p>
      <p>Recently, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ellen-burstyn/">Burstyn</a> spoke with The Associated Press about changes in Hollywood, highlights of her seven-decade career, #MeToo, bad behavior and her turn as a host for the rebooted “Inside the Actor’s Studio.”</p>
      <p>An episode airs Sunday in which she interviews Al Pacino.</p>

      <p>“When we did the interview, he was - he was Al. He’s a genius. He’s unpredictable and deep and profound and funny and there’s nobody like him,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ellen-burstyn/">Burstyn</a> said.</p>
      <p>Pacino had appeared on the show with host James Lipton in 2006, but <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ellen-burstyn/">Burstyn</a> says she was able to relate to him on a different wavelength.</p>
      <p>“Jim was a very skilled interviewer,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ellen-burstyn/">Burstyn</a> said. “But Al and I have had the same training with the same teacher (Lee Strasberg) and almost the same number of years of career. And so, I can appreciate him in a different way. And it affected the kinds of questions I asked him.”</p>
      <p>She did leave one thing out - the show’s iconic final segment.</p>

        <p>“You know we didn’t do the 10 questions. Somehow, we just didn’t get to it. It was a freewheeling kind of event, and it had its own structure, so I never got to ask him his favorite swear words,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ellen-burstyn/">Burstyn</a> said.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ellen-burstyn/">Burstyn</a> has had roles in iconic films “The Exorcist” and “The Last Picture Show.” She starred in “Requiem for a Dream,” and “Resurrection.” She saw the Martin Scorsese-directed “Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore” as a gateway to changing attitudes on how women see the world. In the movie, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ellen-burstyn/">Burstyn</a> played a widowed mother trying to make a new life. The movie was the basis for the TV sitcom “Alice.”</p>
        <p>“Working with Marty and being able to achieve what I wanted in a film in terms of who would direct, who would be cast in it and how it would be done - the intention of the film, which was to tell her story from a woman’s point of view, and Marty succeeded in doing. So that was a huge change,” she said.</p>
        <p>But perhaps the biggest change she’s seen lately in Hollywood has been how women are treated.</p>
        <p>“I think there’s been behavior by people in power that has long been tolerated that is now being called into question,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ellen-burstyn/">Burstyn</a> said. “A line like, ‘when you’re a star you can do anything with them you want,’ is the definition of abuse of power and we should not be surprised if somebody makes a statement like that in relation to a woman that they manifested in other areas too,” she said.</p>
        <p>Dozens of entertainment industry figures - from actors to network bosses - have been accused of sexual misconduct. Most notably among them is movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, who faces a January trial in Manhattan on charges he raped a woman in a hotel room in 2013 and performed a forcible sex act on a different woman in 2006. He has pleaded not guilty and denies all allegations of nonconsensual sex.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ellen-burstyn/">Burstyn</a> applauds justice but thinks that sometimes the boundaries are not overly clear.</p>
        <p>“At the same time, I think we have to be careful to not swing the pendulum so far the other way that everybody is afraid to make a creative move. I’ve seen that happen, you know where somebody is asking permission to touch someone in a scene. I think that’s, you know, we have to know what is really acceptable without going too far in restricting (them),” she said.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ellen-burstyn/">Burstyn</a> also thinks that some behaviors, inexcusable by today’s standards, were at one time acceptable. As an example, she mentioned seeing minstrel shows at the theater as a girl in Detroit.</p>
        <p>“It never occurred to me that there was anything wrong with that. That was perfectly, what seemed normal. Now, I realize when I hear when somebody has been caught with a photographer in blackface 40 years ago, that was a different time,” she said.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ellen-burstyn/">Burstyn</a> doesn’t make excuses for inconsiderate behavior.</p>
        <p>“Now, it’s absolutely - it would be horrendous if somebody did that,” she said.</p>
