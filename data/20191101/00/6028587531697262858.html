      <p>I missed this news the day it happened, but I just heard that BioWare <a href="https://twitter.com/crobertson_atx">has lost its Head of Live Service</a>, as Chad Robertson has just left the studio after 14 years. It’s yet another pretty sizable departure for BioWare, the last one being Ben Irving, who was running <i>Anthem</i> at the time once Mark Darrah and Mike Gamble moved on to <i>Dragon Age</i>.When that happened, I asked who would be heading up <i>Anthem</i> post-launch now with Irving gone. As Head of Live Service, the answer appeared to be Chad Robertson, as he was the one who eventually published a <a href="http://blog.bioware.com/2019/09/17/what-is-next-for-anthem/">blog post</a>, in that instance quite literally being the face of <i>Anthem</i>, explaining what was next for the game. That post included some not-ideal news about the rest of the roadmap, the future “Acts” being scrapped in favor of seasonal content. That content turned out to be a reskin of the Catacylsm for a “Season of Skulls” Halloween event.</p>
      <p>Now? I have no idea who is running what remains of <i>Anthem</i>, if anyone. Robertson was clearly in charge in some capacity after Irving left, but I have no idea what’s happening now. Jesse Anderson, community lead, recently got a new role but he confirmed that he’s still working on <i>Anthem</i> too. I asked him who was running the <i>Anthem</i> show right now in the wake of Robertson’s departure, but I haven’t heard back yet.</p>
      <p>In his departing words, Robertson says that “<i>SW:TOR, Anthem</i>, the Austin studio, and BioWare are in good hands; you can expect great things ahead,” though again, it’s unclear who the torch is being passed to.</p>
      <p>I am often told to stop writing about <i>Anthem</i> because it’s beating a dead horse, and yet I think these departures go beyond <i>just</i> <i>Anthem</i>, and I think many fans are a little concerned about the overall status of BioWare these days after two high profile misses, <i>Andromeda</i> and <i>Anthem</i>, and the next game on the horizon being a new <i>Dragon Age</i> while all these different people are leaving. I don’t have any inside knowledge as to what’s going on, but I am kind of getting Blizzard vibes to a certain extent here, a studio that has produced some of the most beloved classics in the industry sort of starting to meander aimlessly over time with a lot of high profile names leaving.</p>
      <p>I no longer really care about hearing about future plans for <i>Anthem</i> because I simply cannot imagine they will be anything beyond the bare minimum of keeping the game alive on life support, if that. I am starting to be curious about the state of <i>Dragon Age</i>, and the potential future return of <i>Mass Effect</i>, even if that’s years away. I just want to see what they’re working on, since as I fan, I am also very much wanting to get out of this “down” era for BioWare between their last two releases. But nothing yet, nothing but more departures.</p>
