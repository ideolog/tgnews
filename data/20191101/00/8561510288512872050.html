      <h1>Scientists: Something About the Universe Doesn’t Look Right</h1>

      <h3>Constantly Changing</h3>
      <p>In July, we <a href="https://futurism.com/hubble-broke-understanding-universe">reported</a> that scientists were having trouble nailing down the Hubble Constant, a number representing the speed at which our universe is expanding.</p>
      <p>At that time, <a href="https://hubblesite.org/contents/news-releases/2019/news-2019-28">new research</a> proposed the number was 69.8 kilometers per second per megaparsec (km/sec/Mpc), while various other scientists had previously calculated it to be <a href="http://cds.cern.ch/record/481097/files/0012376.pdf">72</a>, <a href="https://hub.jhu.edu/2018/07/12/adam-riess-universe-expansion-hubble-constant/">73.5</a>, or <a href="https://hubblesite.org/contents/news-releases/2019/news-2019-25.html">74.</a> Now, a team from the University of California at Davis has published its <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/490/2/1743/5568378">own research</a> on the Hubble Constant — and it concluded the number is 77.</p>
      <h3>Need-to-Know Number</h3>
      <p>The problem with all these discrepancies is that we really need to nail down the Hubble Constant if we want to understand, well, almost anything about our universe.</p>
      <p>“The Hubble constant is the cosmological parameter that sets the absolute scale, size, and age of the universe,” Wendy Freedman, the physicist who arrived at the 69.8 number, said in a July <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2019/new-hubble-constant-measurement-adds-to-mystery-of-universe-s-expansion-rate">press release</a>. “It is one of the most direct ways we have of quantifying how the universe evolves.”</p>
      <h3>Funny Business</h3>
      <p>Each of the above studies approached the Hubble Constant problem in a different way — Freedman, for example, examined red giant stars to arrive at her number, while the team behind the new UC Davis study used gravitational lens systems.</p>
      <p>There’s a chance that most, if not all, of these teams simply miscalculated — after all, they’re dealing with a lot of variables that could throw off their measurements.</p>
      <p>But as physicist Adam Riess <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/scientists-are-baffled-whats-up-with-the-universe/2019/10/31/31fc42e4-f353-11e9-8cf0-4cc99f74d127_story.html">told <i>The Washington Post</i></a>, there is another possibility: “No one’s wrong. Something else is going on in the universe.”</p>
