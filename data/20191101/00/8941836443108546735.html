      <p>YUMA, Ariz. (AP) - Yuma police say a 3-tyear-old child who collected candy at two Halloween events reportedly became lethargic and other symptoms and that a piece of suspicious candy will be tested.</p>
      <p>Police Sgt. Lori Franklin said Friday that police began investigating after the child was examined at a hospital Thursday night.</p>
      <p>Franklin said the child displayed dilated pupils and “abnormal behavior” and that unwrapped candy resembling a type known to contain THC was found in a container used by the child to collect candy.</p>
      <p>THC is a compound found in marijuana.</p>
