      <h1>Apple promotes several senior directors to VP positions, early iPhone marketing exec returns</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T00:58:00+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 00:58</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5mac.com/author/chmiller44/" target="_blank">Chance Miller</a></address>
      <p>Apple has made several changes at the executive level recently. <i><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-31/apple-names-five-vps-including-return-of-early-iphone-executive">Bloomberg</a></i> reports today that Apple has promoted a handful of employees to the vice president level, which is described as “a key title reserved for the most influential players.”</p>
      <p>Paul Meade has been named a vice president of hardware engineering, while Jon Andrews is now the vice president of software engineering. According to <i>Bloomberg</i>, Meade has led hardware <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/09/10/ios-13-stereo-ar-headset-references/">development for Apple’s augmented reality headset</a>, while Andrews works closely with Craig Federighi on software architecture.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, Gary Geaves has been elevated to a new vice president of acoustics role and Kaiann Drance is now a vice president of marketing. Geaves has worked on HomePod and AirPods audio technology over recent years at Apple. Drance has taken a bigger role in iPhone marketing, and she appeared on stage at last month’s iPhone 11 event.</p>
      <p>All four of these new vice presidents were promoted from the senior director level, which is “a tier below vice president in Apple’s organizational structure.”</p>
      <p>Last but not least, Bob Borchers has returned to Apple as a vice president of marketing. Borchers served as a senior director for iPhone from June 2005 through June 2009, and played a major role in early iPhone marketing efforts. He then departed Apple and worked at Dolby and Google, but is now returning to Apple.</p>
      <p>In his new marketing role at Apple, Borchers will focus on iOS, iCloud, and privacy-related marketing. He, along with Drance, will report to Greg Joswiak.</p>
      <p>Apple’s corporate structure has gone through several changes this year. Angela Ahrendts <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/02/05/angela-ahrendts-departing-apple-deirdre-o-brien/">departed Apple in February</a>, with Deirdre O’Brien taking on a new SVP of retail + people role. In June, it was announced that Jony Ive was departing Apple to form his own independent design company, with <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/06/27/jony-ive-to-depart-apple-form-his-own-independent-design-company/">Jeff Williams taking on</a> new design responsibilities.</p>
