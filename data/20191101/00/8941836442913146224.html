      <p>ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) - Algerians are demonstrating against plans for upcoming elections they fear will be manipulated by a long-despised power structure.</p>
      <p>Friday’s protest coincides with celebrations marking 65 years since the beginning of Algeria’s war for independence from France.</p>
      <p>Thousands of people converged on the capital for Friday’s protest, the 37th since their pro-democracy movement began in February. Some demonstrated peacefully in the streets overnight, while others banged on pots and pans in their homes to show support. Crowds re-convened Friday morning for a march through Algiers.</p>
