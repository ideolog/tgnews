      <p>Friendsgiving is coming to a theater near you this November. In celebration of the show's 25th anniversary, eight <a href="https://www.fathomevents.com/events/friendsgiving?utm_source=fathom&amp;utm_medium=press+releases&amp;utm_campaign=friendsgiving"><i>Friends</i>' Thanksgiving episodes will be shown in theaters</a> across two days on Nov. 24 at 7 p.m. and Nov. 25 at 4 p.m. and 7 p.m. Fathom Events, which previously brought episodes to theaters in September, is behind the special Thanksgiving showings.</p>
      <p>Over the course of 10 seasons,<i> </i><a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/a-friends-giant-turkey-mask-is-here-just-in-time-for-thanksgiving-19213302"><i>Friends</i> served up a cornucopia of iconic Thanksgiving episodes</a>. From the one where Chandler spends the holiday in a box to the one where Monica wears a turkey on her head, the show's Thanksgiving-themed outings are among its most famous. And for good reason; Ross, Rachel, and the rest of the gang helped popularize the idea of <a href="https://www.foodnetwork.com/thanksgiving/thanksgiving-entertaining/the-one-with-a-friends-friendsgiving-party">having a special Thanksgiving with your pals</a>.</p>
      <p>This year, fans of the series can celebrate their Friendsgiving on a grand scale by catching "The One Where Underdog Gets Away," "The One With The List," "The One With The Football," "The One With All The Thanksgivings," "The One Where Ross Got High," "The One Where Chandler Doesn’t Like Dogs," "The One With Rachel’s Other Sister," and "The One With The Late Thanksgiving" all remastered in 4K just in time for their big screen debut. Tickets for the two-day theatrical event go on sale November 1, and if the Thanksgiving showings go over as well as the September ones did, tickets could go fast.</p>
