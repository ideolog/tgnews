      <h1>Most American 11-Year-Olds Now Have Smartphones</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T00:00:00+00:00">01 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Victor Tangermann</a></address>
      <p>According to a <a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/blog/tweens-teens-and-phones-what-our-2019-research-reveals">new report</a> by Common Sense Media, a company that recommends entertainment and technology to families and schools, the average screen time for children in the U.S. is as high as it’s ever been — almost five hours a day for eight- to 12-year-olds, excluding computer time for homework.</p>
      <p>The trend is in part due to children getting smartphones at younger and younger ages. According to the report, 69 percent of children in the U.S. in 2019 have a smartphone by the age of 12. A still significant 19 percent get one by age eight — up from 11 percent in 2015.</p>
      <p>Experts are worried this surge in screen time could have negative effects, as laid out in an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/01/smartphones-children-technology-mobile-phones">opinion piece</a> published Friday in <i>The Guardian</i> — though not all agree.</p>
      <p>The topic of children’s screen time has been contentious among researchers. Scientists <a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/scientists-keep-changing-minds-kids-screen-time">have struggled to agree</a> whether screen time is a good or bad thing for kids.</p>
      <p>Studies have often contradicted each other: some claim it’s nothing to be worried about — in fact, some screen time each day could end up <a href="https://www.jaacap.org/article/S0890-8567(19)31437-6/fulltext">being a good thing</a>. <a href="https://archive.is/L721X#selection-1445.401-1445.582">Others found</a> more than an hour a day was correlated with lower self-control and less emotional stability.</p>
      <p>Screen time could even have lasting effects on children’s developing brains. Last year, a <a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/new-research-screen-time-changing-childrens-brains">landmark research study</a> found that increased screen time caused brain scans of some 4,500 children to show “different patterns.”</p>
