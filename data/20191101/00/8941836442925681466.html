      <h1>Cardinals’ rally comes up short in 28-25 loss to 49ers</h1>

      <p>GLENDALE, Ariz. (AP) - <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/andy-isabella/">Andy Isabella</a> caught Kyler Murray’s pass behind the outstretched hand of a defender and left the rest of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/san-francisco/">San Francisco</a>’s defense flailing behind him.</p>
      <p>A two-point conversion later, Arizona had pulled within three after trailing all night.</p>
      <p>Needing a defensive stop, the Cardinals had no answer for Jimmy Garoppolo and the 49ers.</p>
      <p>Arizona’s upset bid came up short. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/san-francisco/">San Francisco</a>’s undefeated season remained intact.</p>
      <p>Garoppolo threw four touchdown passes and led the 49ers on a clock-winding final drive, helping the 49ers hold off the Cardinals 28-25 Thursday night.</p>

      <p>“We just need to figure out who we are as a defense,” Cardinals safety Budda Baker said.</p>
      <p>The Cardinals (3-5-1) marched for a touchdown on the game’s opening drive, fell flat the rest of the half and rallied against one of the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/national-football-league/">NFL</a>’s two remaining undefeated teams.</p>
      <p>Kenyan Drake had a strong first impression with David Johnson and Chase Edmonds out, accounting for 162 total yards and a touchdown despite having just three days preparation.</p>
      <p>“They got me for a reason, to come out here and make plays,” said Drake, who was traded from the Dolphins on Monday.</p>

        <p>Kyler Murray overcame an unproductive first half - not to mention a near pick-six - by guiding the Cardinals on three second-half scoring drives. He hit KeeSean Johnson on a 9-yard TD pass , put the TD pass to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/andy-isabella/">Isabella</a> just out of the defender’s reach and hit Drake on the 2-point conversion.</p>
        <p>Murray threw for 241 yards and a pair of TDs.</p>
        <p>Arizona’s defense led to its demise.</p>
        <p>A season-long struggle to stop tight ends resurfaced when George Kittle caught a slant, bulldozed Baker and scored a 30-yard touchdown . It was the ninth touchdown by a tight end against Arizona this year.</p>
        <p>“Those big guys, you hit them high and don’t wrap up, he’s going to run over you,” Baker said. “On that slant, I was kind of off-balance and didn’t wrap up and look what happened.”</p>
        <p>Garoppolo hit Kendrick Bourne on a 7-yard score and got a second chance on fourth-and-inches when coach Kliff Kingsbury called timeout just before the Cardinals stopped the 49ers. Garoppolo found Emanuel Sanders on a 1-yard TD to give <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/san-francisco/">San Francisco</a> a 21-7 halftime lead.</p>
        <p>“I wanted to get a Kodak timeout, get one of those looks and have them hopefully run their best play,” Kingsbury said. “They ran a play and it worked for us initially, but obviously looking back on it was would have rather gotten that stop. It just didn’t work out for us this time.”</p>
        <p>The Cardinals had a hard time getting much pressure on Garoppolo and allowed the Niners (8-0) to repeatedly convert on third downs. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/san-francisco/">San Francisco</a> finished 11 for 17 on third down.</p>
        <p>Patrick Peterson also had one of his worst games as a pro in his second game back from a six-game suspension for performance enhancers. The All-Pro cornerback was repeatedly beat by Niners receivers, including a 21-yard touchdown pass from Garoppolo to Dante Pettis in the third quarter.</p>
        <p>“He’s still getting back into game shape and understanding our scheme,” Kingsbury said. “First time he’s ever played in this scheme full speed and live-game reps. He’s a very good football player.”</p>
        <p>Despite their struggles, the Cardinals still had a final chance after <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/andy-isabella/">Isabella</a>’s 88-yard touchdown catch .</p>
        <p>They never got the ball back.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/san-francisco/">San Francisco</a> converted three third downs - one confirmed on review - and ground out the final 4:53 to remain undefeated.</p>
        <p>Good news for the Cardinals: They get another shot at <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/san-francisco/">San Francisco</a> in two weeks.</p>
