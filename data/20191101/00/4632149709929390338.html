      <p>Chief Minister, B S Yediyurappa on Thursday launched the Emergency Response Support System (ERSS) number 112, a single emergency helpline across the state. He flagged off 30 vehicles to respond to 112 calls. <br/><br/>The emergency number was launched by the Centre under the One India One emergency scheme. <br/><br/>All distress and emergency calls across the state will be received here and will be sent out to district control centres from where nearest emergency vehicles will be dispatched. <br/><br/>The system is designed to respond to any SOS calls like police, ambulance, fire, traffic, any help in remote locations and to report suspicious moments. <br/><br/>It is an automated system which will be addressing distress calls in the form of SMS, voice call, web request, e-mail and panic SOS request. <br/><br/>All calls will be monitored at the communication, logistic and modernisation office at Anil Kumble Circle on MG Road. <br/><br/>The Chief Minister said that the number will be helpful to all citizens, especially physically challenged and working women. <br/><br/>DG and IGP, Neelamani N Raju told the media that the helplines 100, 101 and 108 and other toll-free numbers will eventually be merged with the 112 emergency helpline number . <br/><br/><br/>A total of 183 emergency vehicles have been deployed across the state, which will be raised to 500. <br/><br/>People can download the 112 India app on their smartphones and send panic signals in case of an emergency. The app will then send out messages to all emergency contacts. <br/><br/><br/>To place a call to the control room, they can press the power button three times.</p>
