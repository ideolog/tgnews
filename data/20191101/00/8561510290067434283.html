      <h1>Scientists Accidentally Recreate Big Bang Detonation in the Lab</h1>
      <h2>"When we started to dig deeper, we realized that this is relatable to something as profound as the origin of the universe."</h2>

      <p>Ask a scientist — or anyone, really — about the birth of the universe, and they’ll probably tell you it started with the <a href="https://www.space.com/25126-big-bang-theory.html">Big Bang</a>.</p>
      <p>What nobody knows, though, is what caused that explosion. Some suspect the Big Bang was actually a <a href="https://www.inverse.com/article/60603-supernova-explosion-big-bang">massive star going supernova</a>, but again, no one knows what exactly causes those <a href="https://phys.org/news/2015-05-supernova-ignition-scientists.html">stars to ignite</a>, either.</p>
      <p>That might have just changed, though, thanks to a University of Central Florida research team that says it discovered the conditions necessary for a <a href="https://www.ucf.edu/news/ucf-researchers-discover-mechanisms-for-the-cause-of-the-big-bang/">Big Bang explosion in their lab</a> — without actually intending to.</p>
      <p>A team led by Kareem Ahmed, an assistant professor in UCF’s Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, was testing methods for producing hypersonic jet propulsion when it discovered that a passive flame could accelerate and explode on its own.</p>
      <p>“We explore these supersonic reactions for propulsion, and as a result of that, we came across this mechanism that looked very interesting,” Ahmed said in a <a href="https://www.ucf.edu/news/ucf-researchers-discover-mechanisms-for-the-cause-of-the-big-bang/">press release</a>. “When we started to dig deeper, we realized that this is relatable to something as profound as the origin of the universe.”</p>
      <p>What his team discovered was that turbulence could cause a passive flame, like that of a candle, to self-accelerate and eventually detonate.</p>
      <p>From there, the team created a two-inch-by-two-inch shock tube that induces the turbulence needed for a passive flame to become active — essentially, the researchers found a way to create “Little Bangs” mimicking the big one that birthed our universe.</p>
      <p>“We’re taking a simplified flame to where it’s reacting at five times the speed of sound,” Ahmed said in the release.</p>
      <p>They’ve detailed their work in a <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/366/6465/eaau7365">paper</a> published Friday in the journal <i>Science.</i> Aside from potential applications in air and space travel, the researchers believe their study could improve our understanding of the Big Bang, and maybe even what — if anything — <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/dark-matter-big-bang">preceded it</a>.</p>
