      <h1>Purdue, Nebraska looking for turnaround week amid tailspins</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T00:00:00+00:00">01 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">MICHAEL MAROT</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/purdue/">Purdue</a> and Nebraska took time this week to look long and hard at what’s ailing their programs.</p>
      <p>Boilermakers coach <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jeff-brohm/">Jeff Brohm</a> emphasized the need to make corrections. Cornhuskers coach <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/scott-frost/">Scott Frost</a> challenged his guys to play with more passion.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, everyone will find out whose message broke through.</p>
      <p>“There comes a time and place when you have to rip some tails, honestly. That’s what we did,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/scott-frost/">Frost</a> said, explaining the critique was not personal and team captains supported the move. “I still feel like that is what we are missing a little bit, just the guys caring enough to do their job perfect on Saturdays and practice all the time. It is close, but, we can’t do those little things and shoot ourselves in the foot. We are not a good enough team right now.”</p>
      <p>Nebraska’s struggles have mystified a fan base hoping to reclaim the glory days.</p>

      <hr/>
      <p>But since <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/scott-frost/">Frost</a> returned to his alma mater last season, the Cornhuskers (4-4, 2-3 Big Ten) have won only eight games, haven’t been ranked since September and are just 1-7 outside <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/lincoln/">Lincoln</a>. Now, after a 38-31 home loss to Indiana, the Cornhuskers hope to turn things around at <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/purdue/">Purdue</a>.</p>
      <p>The Boilermakers (2-6, 1-4) face a similar plight.</p>
      <p>They’ve been without starting quarterback Elijah Sindelar (broken left collarbone) and All-American receiver Rondale Moore (left hamstring) since Sept. 28.</p>
      <p>In the four games since, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/purdue/">Purdue</a> has lost three times and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jeff-brohm/">Brohm</a>’s high-scoring offense has scored just 73 points, 18.3 per game. Worse, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/purdue/">Purdue</a> now finds itself needing to win its final four games just to become bowl-eligible.</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p>While <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jeff-brohm/">Brohm</a> knows it won’t be easy for a young team decimated by injuries, he expects a better performance than the one he watched last week in driving rain, a 24-6 loss to Illinois.</p>
        <p>“We’ve got to work through this, and I think the only way to do that is to evaluate each performance weekly, make corrections, identify them, talk about them and figure out ways to improve,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jeff-brohm/">Brohm</a> said. “Then you come back and work your tail off to get better and gain confidence to go on the field and play better football. I think our guys will do that.”</p>
        <p>MARTINEZ SAYS HE’S READY</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/scott-frost/">Frost</a> hasn’t named a starting quarterback, but Adrian Martinez says he’s ready to go. Martinez injured his left knee against Northwestern on Oct. 5 and didn’t play against Minnesota and Indiana - both losses. Noah Vedral and Luke McCaffrey have been taking the snaps in Martinez’s absence. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/scott-frost/">Frost</a> said Martinez would have been available in a pinch last week against the Hoosiers.</p>
        <p>“I feel like my arm’s juiced up and everything’s recuperated,” Martinez said. “I’m ready to be back and I’m fired up.”</p>
        <p>FRIENDLY ADMIRERS</p>
        <p>Nebraska receiver-running back Wan’Dale Robinson , who leads Big Ten freshmen with 111.5 all-purpose yards per game, is looking forward to seeing Moore, his training partner. Robinson, from Frankfort, Kentucky, and Moore, have been training at a Louisville gym for three years. Moore played high school football in Louisville.</p>
        <p>“We were just competing and always going back and forth with each other and that helped us out,” Robinson said. “He’s part of the reason how I even got here today, seeing how he is and how he approaches the game and things like that. He’s just been a really big help.”</p>
        <p>REMINDER WEEK</p>
        <p>Just days after Indiana athletic director Fred Glass complained <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/scott-frost/">Frost</a> and his staff were disrespecting the Hoosiers’ program, Nebraska faces a team <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/scott-frost/">Frost</a> offended last year. Moments after a 56-10 loss at Michigan, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/scott-frost/">Frost</a> said the Huskers had played a “really good team and we get a game that we could win next week.” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/purdue/">Purdue</a> responded by beating the Cornhuskers 42-28 in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/lincoln/">Lincoln</a>. In the lead up to the game, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jeff-brohm/">Brohm</a> said <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/scott-frost/">Frost</a>’s comment had been “heard,” and during the coaches’ postgame handshake <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/purdue/">Purdue</a> running back Markell Jones walked past <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/scott-frost/">Frost</a> and mockingly said, “we had a winnable game.”</p>
