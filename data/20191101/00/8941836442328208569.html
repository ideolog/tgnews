      <p>LAS VEGAS (AP) - The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/montreal-canadiens/">Montreal Canadiens</a> turned in an eerily similar performance to last season’s win in their game against the Golden Knights in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/vegas-defenseman-nate-schmidt/">Vegas</a>.</p>
      <p>Brendan Gallagher scored his seventh of the season with 1:58 left in regulation, Max Domi scored 27 seconds into overtime and the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/montreal-canadiens/">Canadiens</a> beat <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/vegas-defenseman-nate-schmidt/">Vegas</a> 5-4 on Thursday night.</p>
      <p>Last season, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/montreal/">Montreal</a> scored with 1:25 left in regulation - and prevailed in OT.</p>
      <p>“The guys never gave up,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/montreal/">Montreal</a> coach Claude Julien said. “We knew it was gonna be a tough game, the key was not to get frustrated, just to stick with it and I think we did a good job of that.”</p>
      <p>Playing the second of a back-to-back after winning 4-1 in Arizona on Wednesday, the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/montreal-canadiens/">Canadiens</a> fell behind 4-2. The Golden Knights seemed to seize momentum with a third-period surge behind goals by Cody Glass and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mark-stone/">Mark Stone</a>.</p>

      <p>But former Golden Knight Tomas Tatar, who came to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/montreal/">Montreal</a> as part of the trade that sent <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/max-pacioretty/">Max Pacioretty</a> to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/vegas-defenseman-nate-schmidt/">Vegas</a>, cut into the Golden Knights’ lead when he scored off a rebound on a shot by Joel Armia off the post.</p>
      <p>“When you’re down by two goals and you’re looking at the clock, it’s a mental game,” Julien said. “But when you score a goal and you’re down by just one and you see that there’s some time left there’s no doubt (Tatar’s goal) gave us some momentum.”</p>
      <p>Julien pulled goaltender Keith Kincaid with a little more than two minutes left in regulation, and it took just 21 seconds during a 6-on-5 sequence for Gallagher to take a perfect feed from Armia in the corner and beat <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/vegas-defenseman-nate-schmidt/">Vegas</a> goalie Marc-Andre Fleury between the pads to tie the game at 4-all.</p>
      <p>Domi then scored his fourth goal of the season when his shot trickled through the pads of Fleury for the winning goal.</p>

        <p>“You want to call it resilience or character - you name it - the team showed a lot tonight,” Domi said. “We didn’t necessarily play the best hockey the first couple of periods, but you know what, good teams find ways to battle through that adversity. Back-to-backs are tough, they’re very, very tough and we found a way to stay with it and (Kincaid) gave us a chance all night and when you get in overtime anything can happen.”</p>
        <p>Phillip Danault and Jonathan Drouin also scored for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/montreal/">Montreal</a>.</p>
        <p>Kincaid made 31 saves for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/montreal/">Montreal</a>. He is within one win of .500 against Western Conference foes, at 19-20-8. He is 13-13-1 lifetime against Pacific Division teams.</p>
        <p>William Karlsson and Alex Tuch also scored for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/vegas-defenseman-nate-schmidt/">Vegas</a>.</p>
        <p>Fleury, who is 22-14-4 lifetime against <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/montreal/">Montreal</a>, made 25 saves. Fleury came into the game with a 3.06 goals-against average against <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/montreal/">Montreal</a> - the fourth-highest of all opponents.</p>
        <p>While <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/vegas-defenseman-nate-schmidt/">Vegas</a> is 8-0-0 when allowing three or fewer goals this season, it dropped to 0-5-1 when allowing four or more goals.</p>
        <p>“We cannot give up five goals,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/vegas-defenseman-nate-schmidt/">Vegas</a> forward Jonathan Marchessault said. “We’re not there for (Fleury). We’re not there for our defensemen. It’s not good enough for us.”</p>
        <p>The loss ruined the return of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/vegas-defenseman-nate-schmidt/">Vegas defenseman Nate Schmidt</a>, who missed 12 games with a lower body injury, and the season-debut of Alex Tuch, who was injured during a preseason game on Sept. 27.</p>
        <p>“I don’t think we were that bad,” Golden Knights coach Gerard Gallant said. “I wasn’t totally happy with all of the game, but it was still good enough to win. I don’t think it’s inconsistency; they got some hockey luck in the end. What do you do about that?”</p>
        <p>Danault got the scoring going 2:35 into the game when he collected a rebound off a shot by Shea Weber and scored into a wide open net. It marked Weber’s 100th point with the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/montreal-canadiens/">Canadiens</a>. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/vegas-defenseman-nate-schmidt/">Vegas</a> was the only team he had not registered a point against.</p>
        <p>Karlsson tied the game late in the first, and then Tuch ignited the 18,035-sellout crowd by putting <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/vegas-defenseman-nate-schmidt/">Vegas</a> ahead with his first of the season and 90th career point.</p>
        <p>Drouin was credited with the only goal of the second period when <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/vegas-defenseman-nate-schmidt/">Vegas</a> defenseman Brayden McNabb knocked the puck into his own goal.</p>
        <p>Glass put the Golden Knights in front with his third goal of the season, and less than three minutes later it was <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mark-stone/">Stone</a> netting his team-high eighth goal and 17th point of the season.</p>
        <p>NOTES: <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/max-pacioretty/">Pacioretty</a>, who spent the first 10 seasons of his career with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/montreal/">Montreal</a>, registered the 500th point of his career with the assist on <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mark-stone/">Stone</a>’s goal. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/max-pacioretty/">Pacioretty</a>, who has 12 points in 14 games for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/vegas-defenseman-nate-schmidt/">Vegas</a>, has 250 goals and 250 assists in 706 NHL games. … The game marked Nick Suzuki’s first game at T-Mobile Arena. The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/montreal-canadiens/">Canadiens</a> forward was the 13th overall draft pick by the Golden Knights in 2017.</p>
