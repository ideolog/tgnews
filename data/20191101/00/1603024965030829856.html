      <p>US President Donald Trump on Thursday slammed the Federal Reserve, alleging that its policies are more damaging to the American economy than China.</p>
      <p>Trump's remarks were the latest in a series of recent barrages he has unleashed at the Fed.</p>
      <p>Demanding lower interest rates, the President said that people are very disappointed with the central bank and its Chair Jay Powell.</p>

      <p>"The Fed has called it wrong from the beginning, too fast, too slow," Trump said in a series of tweets.</p>
      <p>"They even tightened in the beginning. Others are running circles around them and laughing all the way to the bank. Dollar and rates are hurting our manufacturers," he said, demanding a lowering of the interest rates.</p>
      <p>"We should have lower interest rates than Germany, Japan and all others. We are now by far the biggest and strongest country, but the Fed puts us at a competitive disadvantage. China is not our problem, the Federal Reserve is! We will win anyway," Trump said.</p>
      <p>The President also said that China and the US are working on selecting a new site for signing of Phase One of Trade Agreement, about 60 per cent of total deal, after APEC in Chile was cancelled due to unrelated circumstances.</p>
      <p>"The new location will be announced soon. President Xi (Jinping) and President Trump will do signing!" he added.<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/promos/pro.php"><b>Special Thursday Expiry on <s>10<sup>th</sup></s> 7<sup>th</sup> Nov</b><br/>Early Closure to The Great Diwali Discount.
