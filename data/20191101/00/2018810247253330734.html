      <p>Pro wrestler Kenny Omega <a href="http://www.kotaku.com.au/2019/06/elite-wrestler-kenny-omega-loves-mother-3-and-talks-business-over-apex-legends">loves anime and video games</a>. Like most people who love both of those things, he’s also <a href="https://kotaku.com/1831413823">a huge fan of <i>Undertale</i></a>. During this week’s Halloween-themed All-Elite Wrestling promo, Omega, who is known for incorporating his fandom into his act, went all-in, dressing as Sans Undertale for his big entrance.</p>
      <p>As you can see, his costume rules. He even did a whole <i>Undertale</i>-style cutscene to intro him! He really is a pro.</p>

      <p>I know this is not how wrestling works, but he should wrestle in that costume, it’d be fun. I’d watch.</p>
