      <p>ITHACA, N.Y. (AP) - Collin Eaddy ran 21 times for 93 yards and two touchdowns and Princeton stayed undefeated with a 21-7 win over Cornell on Friday night.</p>

      <p>The Big Red (2-5, 1-3) cut the deficit to 14-7 on Richie Kenney’s 1-yard run in the middle of the third quarter.</p>
      <p>Eaddy capped an eight-play, 75-yard scoring drive on the next possession with a 4-yard run , his league-leading ninth TD run of the season.</p>
