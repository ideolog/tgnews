        <b>MOSCOW (Sputnik) - North Korea's Academy of Defence Science has confirmed a successful test of super-large multiple rocket launchers, the state-run KCNA news agency reported early on Friday, adding that the country's leader, Kim Jong Un, had expressed his satisfaction over the launch.</b>

      <p>On Thursday, the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff said Pyongyang had fired two short-range missiles from the Phyongannamdo province's city of Sunchon to a range of around 370 kilometers [229 miles] and an altitude reaching around 90 kilometers.</p>
      <p>The KCNA reported that the Central Committee of the Workers' Party had been informed about the successful test launch on the spot.</p>
      <p>Earlier in the day,Â the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff (JSC) reported that North Korea <a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201910311077188140-north-korea-launches-unidentified-projectile---seoul/">launched two unidentified objects toward the sea of Japan</a>.</p>
      <p>North Korea has recently announced to have successfully test-fired a new submarine-launched ballistic missile.</p>
      <p>Since July, North Korea has activated its weapons tests in violation of UNSC resolutions. On Thursday, the United Nations expressed hope that Pyongyang would re-engage in its <a href="http://sputniknews.com/world/20191027/1077159106.html">negotiations on denuclearization with Washington</a>.</p>
      <p>The two countries have been engaged in off-and-on negotiations on the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula for months. Their negotiators met for a working meeting for the most recent time in early October in Stockholm.</p>
      <p>However, the meeting abruptly finished without any agreement. North Korea said the United States had not taken Pyongyang's demands into account, something denied by Washington.</p>
