      <h1>Tim Miller Fought With James Cameron Over Terminator: Dark Fate’s Final Cut</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T00:48:38+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 00:48</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Abbate</a></address>
      <p>James Cameron is famously not easy to work for on films he directs. However, it sounds like he can also be a demanding presence on movies where he isn’t in completely charge. This was reportedly the case during post-production on <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/terminator-dark-fate"><b>Terminator: Dark Fate</b></a>, which marks Cameron’s return to the <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/terminator"><b>Terminator</b></a> franchise after almost 30 years. Although he bequeathed directorial duties to Tim Miller, Cameron apparently had his own uncompromising vision for the film as a co-writer and producer.</p>
      <p>Via <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483284/james-cameron-compares-working-on-alita-battle-angel-with-terminator-dark-fate">Cinema Blend</a>, Cameron was recently asked if he had any disagreements with Miller during <b>Dark Fate</b>’s editing process. Surprisingly, he described the mood in the edit bay using rather gruesome terms.</p>
      <p>“I would say many,” said Cameron. “And the blood is still being scrubbed off the walls from those creative battles. This is a film that was forged in fire. So yeah, but that’s the creative process, right?”</p>

      <p>Cameron has a well-documented reputation for losing his temper on movie sets. Regardless, he seemed to insist that this isn’t always a by-product of collaborating with him. In fact, he had nothing but good things to say about working with Robert Rodriguez on <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/alita-battle-angel"><b>Alita: Battle Angel</b></a>, which Cameron also co-wrote and produced.</p>
      <p>“I mean, my work with Robert on <b>Alita</b> was very different,” continued Cameron. “Robert loved the script, loved everything, said, ‘I just want to make this movie. I want to make the movie the way you see it.’ I was like, ‘No, you got to make it your movie.’ I had the reverse experience with Tim, which is Tim wanted to make it his movie. And I’m like, ‘Yeah, but I kind of know a little about this world.’ So I had the matter and the anti-matter version of that producorial experience.”</p>
      <p>Fortunately, any clashes between Cameron and Miller don’t seem to have drastically hurt <b>Dark Fate</b>’s quality. The film has earned mostly positive reviews, with several critics calling it the best <b>Terminator</b> entry since <b>T2</b>. Fans can form their own opinions when the film opens in theaters tonight.</p>
      <p>Should Cameron have let Miller guide the editing process on his own or are you glad he stepped in? Tell us what you think in the comment section below!</p>
