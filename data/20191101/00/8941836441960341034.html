      <p>TOKYO (AP) - Inspirational captain. Goalkicker. Tough tackler.</p>
      <p>Baby sitter?</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/owen-farrell/">Owen Farrell</a> will lead England onto the field for the Rugby World Cup final against South Africa on Saturday and, a couple of hours later, could become only the second Englishman to lift the Webb Ellis Cup.</p>
      <p>It won’t be the first time he has been to the biggest game in rugby.</p>
      <p>Former England captain Lawrence Dallaglio tells a story of the 2007 final in Paris - also involving England and the Springboks - and how he brought his then 5-year-old son, Enzo, to the Stade de France.</p>
      <hr/>
      <hr/>
      <p>“Enzo watched the final on the shoulders of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/owen-farrell/">Owen Farrell</a>, who was our baby sitter at the time because I was playing with his father, Andy Farrell,” Dallaglio recalls. “Of course years later, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/owen-farrell/">Owen Farrell</a> was playing rugby for England, and I turn the telly on. Enzo said, ‘Dad, that’s the baby sitter.’ I went, ‘Umm, I haven’t talked to you about that. He won’t be babysitting for you anymore!”</p>
      <p>Dallaglio described <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/owen-farrell/">Farrell</a>, who was 16 at the 2007 World Cup, as being “lovely, lovely, lovely young boy” back then.</p>
      <p>“He still is, by the way,” he adds. “He just doesn’t tell you that.”</p>
      <p>Indeed, the public image these days of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/owen-farrell/">Farrell</a> - understated, reserved, he of the bland quotes - apparently doesn’t tally with what he is like inside the locker room or on the field.</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p>On Friday night, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/owen-farrell/">Farrell</a> will gather England’s squad in a room in a Tokyo hotel and lead a meeting where he asks all the players how they are feeling, while also delivering his own message.</p>
        <p>“Without fail, you could hear a pin drop,” said England hooker Jamie George, who is also a teammate of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/owen-farrell/">Farrell</a>’s at English club Saracens. “Everyone is hanging on every word that he says. It is very inspirational, without tearing the roof down.”</p>
        <p>Leadership, it seems, runs through the Farrell family.</p>
        <p>Andy Farrell was a great in rugby league, becoming - at age 21 - the youngest ever player to captain Britain. He also captained Wigan Warriors, England’s most decorated club side, and represented England at two World Cups.</p>
        <p>The elder <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/owen-farrell/">Farrell</a> switched codes in 2005 and was also a success in the 15-man game, playing for England at the 2007 World Cup. He has been a well-respected defense coach for England, Ireland and the British and Irish Lions, and will take over as head coach of Ireland after this World Cup.</p>
        <p>It’s no surprise that his son has shone as England’s rugby leader, then, starting with guiding the England under-20s side to a Six Nations Grand Slam in 2011. He is less than a year into the captaincy of the senior team, having originally been appointed co-captain in 2018 alongside Dylan Hartley, who has since dropped out of the squad because of knee problems.</p>
        <p>Somewhat ironically, Eddie Jones - the England coach who has entrusted the armband on <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/owen-farrell/">Farrell</a> this World Cup - fired Andy Farrell as the team’s defense coach upon taking charge in late 2015.</p>
        <p>“He’s the ultimate professional,” England lock George Kruis said of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/owen-farrell/">Owen Farrell</a> on Friday, on the eve of the final. “He’s very rounded and has worked incredibly hard on improving himself, as well. You look to five, six, seven years ago, he’s improved himself as a character, he’s a lot more rounded and he can deal with a lot.”</p>
        <p>Kruis might have been referring to a period when <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/owen-farrell/">Farrell</a> was viewed as something of a hot-head, one example being his scuffle with Schalk Brits while playing for the British and Irish Lions against the Barbarians in the 2013 tour opener in Hong Kong.</p>
        <p>Always a ferocious tackler similar to another England flyhalf, 2003 World Cup winner Jonny Wilkinson, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/owen-farrell/">Farrell</a> faced questions about his technique just last year when two of his no-arms tackles went unpunished during the autumn tests. World Rugby later said <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/owen-farrell/">Farrell</a> should have been handed either yellow or red cards on those occasions, and it forced him to make some “adjustments” to his technique.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/owen-farrell/">Farrell</a>’s defense has been virtually flawless in the World Cup, whether at flyhalf or inside center - positions he alternates in depending if Jones wants to line up his captain with close friend George Ford, an out-and-out No. 10.</p>
        <p>His captaincy has also stood out, particularly in the knockout stage.</p>
        <p>When England conceded a try to Australia early in the second half of their quarterfinal match, which trimmed England’s lead to 17-16, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/owen-farrell/">Farrell</a> got his teammates into a huddle by the posts and was calm with his instructions to a squad that even Jones recently accused of having mental fragility. Australia didn’t score another point.</p>
        <p>Before the 17-9 win over New Zealand in the semifinals, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/owen-farrell/">Farrell</a> smirked and smiled as he led England into a V formation to flank the All Blacks’ haka.</p>
        <p>One more challenge awaits <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/owen-farrell/">Farrell</a> and England before he can get his hands on the World Cup and raise it aloft, like Martin Johnson did 16 years ago.</p>
        <p>They have different personalities, yet Johnson and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/owen-farrell/">Farrell</a> have certain traits that bond them.</p>
        <p>Winners, for sure, but also natural leaders in their own special way.</p>
