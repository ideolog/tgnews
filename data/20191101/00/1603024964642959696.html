      <p>Technology giant Google will acquire Fitbit at the price of $2.1 billion in a bid to diversify beyond its primary business of online search to hardware.</p>
      <p>The move was announced by the two companies on November 1 as Google's entry into the wearable technology space could bolster Fitbit's struggle against rivals that include Apple.</p>
      <p>"Google is an ideal partner to advance our mission. Fitbit will be able to accelerate innovation in the wearables category, scale faster, and make health even more accessible to everyone. I could not be more excited for what lies ahead." Rick Osterloh, Google senior vice president for devices and services, said the deal for the wearable tech pioneer is one "bringing together the best hardware, software and AI, to build wearables to help even more people around the world," Fitbit co-founder and chief executive James Park said in a statement by the two firms announcing the deal.</p>
