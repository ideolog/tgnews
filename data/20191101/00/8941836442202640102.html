      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T00:00:00+00:00">01 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/staff/douglas-ernst/" target="_blank">Douglas Ernst</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mickey-rourke/">Mickey Rourke</a> says it’s only a matter of time before he delivers a “left hook from hell” to President Trump.</p>
      <p>The man who played Ivan Vanko in “Iron Man 2” told an entertainment website this week that Mr. Trump is “gonna feel” his fists after leaving office.</p>
      <p>“It’s personal,” he told TooFab of a lawsuit for damage inside a Trump hotel room in the 1990s. “There’s gonna be a day where he ain’t president, and we’re gonna bump into each other. And you’re gonna feel me.”</p>
      <p>The lawsuit also included deceased rapper Tupac Shakur.</p>
      <p>“You know what happens?’ he <a href="https://toofab.com/2019/10/30/mickey-rourke-vows-to-thump-trump-with-a-left-hook-from-hell-exclusive/">continued</a> Wednesday from Los Angeles. “What goes up, goes down. And when it goes down, it goes down like a motherf—er,” he added. “That’s the life we live in. … He’s gonna feel me. You hear me? You’re gonna feel me. What you said about us? On my brother — you’re gonna feel me.”</p>
