      <p>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) - Mi Jung Hur shot a second consecutive 6-under 66 to take a one-stroke lead after Friday’s second round of the LPGA Swinging Skirts.</p>
      <p>Hur, who is looking for her third victory this season, is at 12-under 132 overall. Defending champion Nelly Korda (67) was one shot back while trying to win her second LPGA title of the season and third of her career.</p>
      <p>Minjee Lee (67) and In-Kyung Kim (65) are two strokes behind.</p>
      <p>Hur, a 10-year LPGA veteran, said it was difficult with her husband and family in the gallery.</p>
      <p>“Yeah, there’s a little bit of pressure with my family,” Hur said. “The whole family are here. But they were there last week, as well, so getting used to it.”</p>

      <p>Henderson is three strokes behind Mi after opening with a 71.</p>
