        <figcaption>LAS VEGAS, NV - JANUARY 08: WWE Chairman and CEO Vince McMahon speaks at a news conference ...

      <p>It shouldn’t matter for <b>too</b> long, but Wall Street was not happy with the numbers in World Wrestling Entertainment’s <a href="https://corporate.wwe.com/investors/news/press-releases/2019/10-31-2019-122937923">third quarter report</a> for investors. As a result, company stock tumbled 15.65% by the end of the trading day, falling by $10.40, from $66.44 to $56.04. Specifically, WWE changed their profit guidance for the whole of 2019, and that appears to have led to a bit of a sell-off.“The Company has modified its full year 2019 guidance to an Adjusted OIBDA [Operating income before depreciation and amortization)] range of $180 million to $190 million, which would be an all-time record,” reads the report. “The change is attributable to the delay in completing a previously contemplated agreement in the MENA [Middle East and North Afric] region and the impact of accelerated investment to support content creation. While the Company continues to work toward the completion of a MENA agreement, no assurances can be given in this regard. The Company expects to have clarity on this point in advance of providing guidance for 2020.”</p>
      <p>“In the quarter, we accelerated strategic investments to support our content creation,” said WWE co-president George Barrios. “Although we have modified our 2019 guidance of Adjusted OIBDA to a range of $180 million to $190 million, performance in this range would still be an all-time record. We continue to believe in WWE’s global growth potential and remain focused on maximizing future opportunities and shareholder value.”</p>
      <p>Things will be <b>much</b> different when we get the Q4 and annual reports, though, because the new domestic television deals kicking in for <i>Monday Night Raw</i> (on USA Network), <i>Friday Night SmackDown</i> (on Fox), and <i>NXT</i> (also on USA Network) all <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidbixenspan/2019/08/29/wwe-fox-usa-tv-contracts-2019-loss-leader-report/#2a154015c2d6">got going</a> at the start of October. <i>Raw</i> now brings in $265 million/year ($66.25 million/quarter), while <i>SmackDown</i> is getting WWE $205 million/year ($51.25 million), bringing the company to record revenue and profitability levels.</p>
