      <h1>MPs fury over Whirlpool’s blazing tumble dryers that sparked hundreds of fires</h1>
      <h2>Electrical firm criticised for slow response over tumble dryer flaws that could impact some 800,000 machines</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T00:00:00+00:00">01 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Ben Glaze, https://www.facebook.com/MirrorPolitics</a></address>
      <p>Electrical giant Whirlpool has been slammed by angry MPs over its handling of the tumble dryer safety scandal.</p>
      <p>A Commons Business Committee report blasts the firm’s slow response over flaws that have caused at least 750 fires since 2004, including one that killed two men in North Wales.</p>
      <p>They say it is “astonishing” that 800,000 at-risk dryers are still in homes four years after flaws were revealed.</p>
      <p>Chairwoman Rachel Reeves said the firm’s actions “often owed more to PR management than to taking practical steps to make its machines safe”.</p>

      <p>She called for a new independent watchdog with more teeth.</p>
      <p>Affected brands include Hotpoint, Indesit, Creda, Swan and Proline.</p>
      <p>The report says the use of non-disclosure agreements to “silence” cus­­tomers over fires is “disgraceful”.</p>
      <p>Jeff Noel of Whirlpool said safety was the top priority and a product recall, which began only this year, had achieved “five times the average success rate”.</p>
