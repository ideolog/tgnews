      <p>PRESIDENT Emmerson Mnangagwa has failed to turn around the country’s economic as well as political fortunes and this calls for his resignation, former Finance Minister Tendai Biti has said.</p>
      <p>Biti, who is MDC vice president, was responding to Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe Governor John Mangudya’s announcement that the country will have the first notes and coins of the re-designated Zimbabwe Dollar in the next two weeks.</p>
      <p>Mnangagwa’s administration in June announced the discontinuation of the multi-currency system adopted in 2009 and dominated by the US dollar.</p>
      <p>Using Statutory Instrument 142/19, authorities also effectively returned the local currency as sole medium of exchange but had not produced the notes and coins to go with the decision.</p>
      <p>Writing on his twitter handle, on Wednesday, the Harare East MP said Mnangagwa and his government have become a threat to Zimbabwe’s sovereignty.</p>
      <p>“The currency confusion, power shortages, inflation, the doctors’ strike and massive corruption have proven beyond doubt that Emmerson Mnangagwa has failed.</p>
      <p>“He must step down or constitutional process must remove him,” said Biti.</p>
      <p>Mnangagwa seized power in a military coup in November 2017 before calling for elections that he went on to win with a slim margin amid claims of rigging by the opposition.</p>
      <p>Biti argued that the decision to print the new currency was recipe for disaster given the fundamentals required in an economy to introduce a currency are not yet in place.</p>
      <p>“The illegitimate government has gone nuts. How does a government change currency three times in a year? A fresh talk of adopting the Rand. Fact is they can adopt any currency they want but without the right macroeconomic conditions prevailing, it is a total waste of time,” said Biti.</p>
      <p>Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube in the past few days seemed to have indicated Zimbabwe was considering adopting the South African Rand as its anchor currency.</p>
      <p>Biti added: “They went through the original Zimbabwe Dollar, then they brought, then the bearer cheques which they again bastardised. Then they went through the USD, the bond note and the RTGS$.</p>
      <p>“They can bring 100 other currencies but it will not help. There is no confidence in them and no one trusts them.”</p>
      <p>Biti reiterated that economics is a science of logic and planning, “not a kick and hope nor kick and rush; nor a prophecy.”</p>
      <p>“That a country can introduce three currencies in a year is criminal economics. The consequences from a planning, accounting and economic view point are catastrophic,” said Biti.</p>
      <p>President Mnangagwa has however attributed the current situation to sanctions imposed by the US and its Western allies. – Newzim</p>
