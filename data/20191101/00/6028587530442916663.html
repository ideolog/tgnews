      <p><b>NEW YORK – November 1, 2019</b> – The One Free Press Coalition, a united group of pre-eminent editors and publishers using their global reach and social platforms to spotlight journalists under attack worldwide, today issued the ninth monthly “10 Most Urgent” list of journalists whose press freedoms are being suppressed or whose cases are seeking justice. This month’s list has a focus on impunity, in connection with the <b>International Day to End Impunity for Crimes Against Journalists</b>. The United Nations General Assembly proclaimed November 2 as the ‘International Day to End Impunity for Crimes against Journalists.’ The date was chosen in commemoration of the assassination of two French journalists in Mali on November 2, 2013. UNESCO is observing with the launch of a #KeepTruthAlive campaign.</p>
      <p>Published this morning by all Coalition members and at <a href="https://www.onefreepresscoalition.com/">www.onefreepresscoalition.com</a>, the ninth “10 Most Urgent” list includes the following:</p>

        <b>No answers or justice one year after violent murder inside Saudi consulate.</b>

      <p>No <a href="https://cpj.org/blog/2018/10/the-paths-to-justice-in-jamal-khashoggis-murder.php">independent criminal investigation</a> has come in 13 months without answers in the brazen killing of <i>Washington Post</i> columnist Jamal Khashoggi. Pressured by recent attacks on Saudi oil facilities, the Kingdom’s crown prince spoke out in September denying any role in the murder but did claim responsibility for the “mistake” on behalf of consulate workers in Istanbul. Yet, findings from the UN and CIA point to his involvement. Stateside, President Donald Trump blew a Congressional deadline to release intelligence reports under the U.S. Global Magnitsky Act.</p>

In September the Maltese government announced the establishment of a public inquiry, calling on investigators to ensure the process is fully independent and impartial. <a href="https://cpj.org/blog/2019/10/cpj-joins-call-to-end-impunity-in-killing-of-malte.php">Three men</a> are currently in detention in relation to the killing; however, the perpetrators, including the masterminds, have yet to be brought to justice and no trial dates have been announced.</p>

The next day Abdel Fattah announced on social media she would begin a hunger strike to protest abuse while in custody; officials had taken her to an undisclosed location, beat her, hung her from handcuffs for hours, and choked her while demanding she give up her cellphone password.</p>

      <p>Come November 21, two years will have passed in the disappearance of freelance journalist Azory Gwanda, who had been investigating <a href="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2018-11-12-southern-african-muckraking-the-disappearance-of-tanzanian-journalist-azory-gwanda/">mysterious killings</a> in rural Tanzania. The government has failed to conduct a credible investigation or disclose information. In July, Tanzanian Foreign Minister Palamagamba Kabudi <a href="https://cpj.org/2019/07/in-bbc-interview-tanzanian-foreign-minister-says-j.php">said</a> Gwanda had “disappeared and died” but then backtracked amid requests for clarification. <i>   </i></p>

The Mexico City newspaper reported that a note reading “for being a snitch” was found at the scene.

His detention, which was initially pegged for 15 days, has been repeatedly renewed every 45 days and stems from a 2016 documentary about conscription in Egypt, which the government claims uses fake footage and aims to incite chaos.</p>
