      <p>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) - A Nicaraguan court on Friday convicted a dual U.S.-Nicaraguan citizen of killing a nursing student in New York state after an unusual trial that saw many witnesses testifying by long-distance video conference.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/broome/">Broome</a> County District Attorney <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/steve-cornwell/">Steve Cornwell</a> confirmed Orlando Tercero’s conviction in a tweet. The 23-year-old former <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/binghamton-university/">Binghamton University</a> student was found guilty of the March 2018 killing 22-year-old Haley Anderson. Witnesses said the two had a romantic relationship but Tercero wanted a more serious relationship, according to trial testimony. Anderson, originally from Westbury on Long Island, was found strangled in his bed.</p>
      <p>Tercero fled to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nicaragua/">Nicaragua</a> the day after the killing.</p>
      <p>The trial was held in the Nicaraguan capital of Managua because the Central American nation’s laws forbid extradition of its citizens.</p>
      <p>The Broome County District Attorney’s office in New York facilitated testimony by witnesses who spoke with the help of a translator via a video link from a room in the district attorney’s office in downtown <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/binghamton-university/">Binghamton</a>.</p>

      <p>One of the witnesses, a police investigator, testified via the video link that Tercero left a note at his residence saying he was sorry.</p>
      <p>Citing Judge María Fabiola Betancourt, a prosecution official said sentencing for Tercero would be held within days. The maximum sentence in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nicaragua/">Nicaragua</a> is 30 years. Anderson’s parents said they wanted Tercero to receive the maximum penalty, according to the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/binghamton-university/">Binghamton</a> Press &amp; Sun-Bulletin.</p>
      <p>“We saw something that we haven’t seen before, but we saw two governments working together, law enforcement agencies working together,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/steve-cornwell/">Cornwell</a> told the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/binghamton-university/">Binghamton</a> Press &amp; Sun-Bulletin after the verdict was announced. “Although not what we wanted, we wanted to have the trial here, but we saw justice take place in a courtroom on an international stage.”</p>
      <p>The victim’s father, Gordon Anderson, also praised the way <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nicaragua/">Nicaragua</a> handled the case, telling the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/binghamton-university/">Binghamton</a> newspaper that the verdict provided “some ease to the heartache and a little bit of conclusion.”</p>

        <p>“I mean it’s not over, and there will always be an emptiness that’s there, but it was nice to see that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nicaragua/">Nicaragua</a> did a really professional, bang up job to get the job done,” he added.</p>
