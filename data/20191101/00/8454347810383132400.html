      <p>That <i>Game of Thrones</i> prequel series that was to star Naomi Watts and Miranda Richardson, that was to be set thousands of years before the original series, that shot a full pilot episode in Ireland earlier this year?</p>
      <p>Yeah, no, HBO cancelled that this week, confirming it would not move forward with the <a href="https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/everything-we-know-about-hbos-game-of-thrones-prequel/">highly-anticipated series</a> on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>But before the day had ended, the cable network offered news about that <i>other</i> prequel to fans: HBO has given a 10-episode order to <i>House of the Dragon</i>, a story that will revolve around House Targaryen and be set 300 years before the events of <i>Game of Thrones</i>.</p>
      <p>Author George R.R. Martin co-created <i>House of the Dragon</i> with <i>Colony</i> co-creator and showrunner Ryan Condal, and the series will be based on the events in Martin’s Targaryen “history” novel <a href="http://www.georgerrmartin.com/grrm_book/fire-and-blood/"><i>Fire &amp; Blood</i></a>, as well as short stories in the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dangerous-Women-George-R-Martin/dp/076533206X"><i>Dangerous Women</i></a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rogues-George-R-Martin/dp/0345537262/"><i>Rogues</i></a> anthologies. Emmy-winning <i>GoT</i> director and producer Miguel Sapochnik will direct the pilot and additional episodes, Condal will write the series, and the two will team up as showrunners.</p>
      <p>But in a <a href="http://georgerrmartin.com/notablog/2019/10/30/the-dragons-take-wing/">blog post</a>, Martin denied that <i>House of the Dragon</i> is the reason <i>Kick-Ass</i> and <i>Kingsman</i> writer Jane Goldman’s <i>GoT</i> prequel, which was focused on the Stark family and the White Walkers and that the author unofficially called <i>The Long Night</i>, is deader than the attendees of the Red Wedding.</p>
      <p>“It goes with saying that I was saddened to hear the show would not be going to series,” Martin wrote about the Goldman–Watts spin-off. “I do not know why HBO decided not to go to series on this one, but I do not think it had to do with <i>House of the Dragon</i>.</p>
      <p>“This was never an either/or situation. If television has room enough for multiple <i>CSI</i>s and <i>Chicago</i> shows … well, Westeros and Essos are a lot bigger, with thousands of years of history and enough tales and legends and characters for a dozen shows. Heartbreaking as it is to work for years on a pilot, to pour your blood and sweat and tears into it, and have it come to nought, it’s not at all uncommon. I’ve been there myself, more than once. I know Jane and her team are feeling the disappointment just now, and they have all my sympathy … with my thanks for all their hard work, and my good wishes for whatever they do next.”</p>
      <p>Martin also confirmed that <i>House of the Dragon</i> has been in development for years, that he first talked to HBO about it in 2016.</p>
      <p>As for specifics on the new series: “Well, I can’t actually spill those beans,” Martin wrote, “but you might want to pick up a copy of two anthologies I did with Gardner Dozois, <i>Dangerous Women</i> and <i>Rogues</i>, and then move on to Archmaester Gyldayn’s history, <i>Fire &amp; Blood</i>.”</p>
      <p>Archmaester Gyldayn is the fictional author of the Targaryen history book.</p>
