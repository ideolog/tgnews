      <h1>Julián Castro: Democrats Taking 'Safe Route' to Defeat Trump</h1>
      <h2>Democrat presidential hopeful and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro asserted Wednesday that Democrats should not take the “safe route” in order to win back the White House.</h2>

      <p>Castro’s remarks came after Sirius XM’s Dean Obeidallah inquired about the lack of diversity among current front-runners in the Democrat primary, which includes Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), former Vice President Joe Biden, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA).</p>
      <p>“I don’t take anything away from the people that right now are leading the pack,” Castro said. “They’ve worked very hard. They’re great, talented candidates.”</p>

      <p>Castro also insisted that all he is asking for in the presidential race is a “fair hearing.”</p>
      <p>“There’s also this anxiety among a lot of Democrats today… this thought that the best way to beat Donald Trump is the safe route,” Castro continued. “And they equate that with a certain profile of candidate.”</p>
      <p>Castro then claimed the Democrat Party should “do what the last successful Democrat did, which was Barack Obama.”</p>
      <p>In order for Democrats to take back the White House, Castro believes Democrats must “ignite this young, diverse coalition of working-class people and people across the country that are going to get off the sidelines and into the voting booths.”</p>
      <p>Castro, who has participated in every Democrat debate held up until this point, has yet to qualify for the November debate. According to RealClearPolitics’ <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/us/2020_democratic_presidential_nomination-6730.html">average</a>, Castro is polling at 0.7 percent.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, Castro <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/2020-election/2019/10/21/julian-castro-my-campaign-is-over-unless-i-raise-800000-in-10-days/">pleaded</a> for donations to assist with his campaign and stated that if he did not raise $800,000 by October 31, 2019, he would have to drop out of the race.</p>
      <p>“[T]his is a critical moment— if my campaign can’t raise $800,000 by October 31st, my campaign will be silenced for good,” Castro wrote in a tweet at the time.</p>
