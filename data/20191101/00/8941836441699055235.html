      <h1>Cavs general manager Koby Altman signs multiyear extension</h1>

      <p>CLEVELAND (AP) - Cavaliers general manager <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/koby-altman/">Koby Altman</a> has signed a multiyear contract extension.</p>
      <p>Details were not immediately available Friday. The 37-year-old Altman signed a three-year contract in 2017, not long after he took over when the club parted with previous GM David Griffin.</p>
      <p>Altman is the first GM to receive an extension under owner Dan Gilbert, who bought the Cavs from Gordon Gund in 2005.</p>
      <p>He will continue to oversee a rebuild that began when LeBron James left as a free agent in 2017 after leading Cleveland to its fourth straight NBA Finals appearance.</p>
      <p>The Cavs went just 19-63 during an injury-ravaged 2018-19 season. They are off to a 2-2 start this year under first-year coach John Beilein.</p>

      <p>Altman has been acquiring future draft picks. He’s also orchestrated contract extensions for Kevin Love, Larry Nance Jr. and Cedi Osman.</p>
