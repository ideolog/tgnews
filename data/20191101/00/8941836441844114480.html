      <p>ORINDA, Calif. (AP) - The Latest on a shooting in Northern California on Halloween night (all times local):</p>
      <p>8 a.m.</p>
      <p>The owner of the Northern California home where four people were killed and four wounded in a Halloween night shooting says a woman had rented the home through Airbnb for a family reunion.</p>
      <p>Michael Wang tells The San Francisco Chronicle the reunion was supposed to have a dozen people and but that scores showed up for the party in Orinda, a wealthy city east of Berkeley.</p>
      <p>Wang says he got calls from the neighbors about the noise and that his wife reached out to the woman, who claimed there were only 12 people in the home.</p>

      <p>Airbnb spokesman Ben Breit says in an email that the company is “urgently investigating” what happened.</p>
      <p>Police have not released further details about the shooting.</p>
