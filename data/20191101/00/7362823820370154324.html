      <p>The statue had been kept in a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/united-kingdom">British</a> military cathedral following the 1982 <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/the-falklands-war-30-years-later">Falklands War</a>, in which Britain defeated Argentina.</p>

      <p>The Our Lady of Lujan stature will go back to Argentina and replicas will be sent to Britain. Following his public appearance, Francis kissed a stone plaque that honors Argentina's war dead and wiped his eyes.</p>
      <p>Argentine troops brought the stature to the Falklands when it invaded the British territory in 1982. Argentina maintains the land was taken illegally in 1833.</p>

      <p>Following the two-month war, the statue was placed in the cathedral where it served as a focus of prayer for the dead on both sides.</p>
