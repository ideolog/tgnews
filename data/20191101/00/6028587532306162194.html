      <p>When short sellers are forced to cover you can get quite a rally. We saw this in October after Tesla reported earnings that exceeded the predictions of Wall Street analysts. The short float in the stock at the time was 25% – very high, to put it mildly, for such a well known name – and the price quickly blasted from the 250 level all the way up to 330.</p>
      <p>Here’s how it looked on the weekly price chart:</p>

      <p>So many were so short because some analysts who closely study the financials see serious problems. Forbes contributor Jim Collins described his issues with the car manufacturer’s numbers <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimcollins/2019/08/21/tesla-has-failed-massively-as-a-public-company/#7c1806661dc2">in this piece</a> published in late August.</p>
      <p>When Elon Musk’s auto concern reported the better than expected numbers, buyers came in quickly and then the shorts had to buy back their shares. A much bigger than expected rally ensued: the short-covering rally is legendary when it really gets going, as it did in this case.</p>
      <p>Seeing Tesla’s mid-October fun, hedge funds searching for unusual upside opportunity might begin looking at other stocks that have been heavily shorted lately.</p>
      <p>Here are a few that might be showing up on such lists:</p>
      <p><b>RPC., Inc</b> is an oil and gas exploration company with a 47% short float. The New York Stock Exchange traded stock has dropped from 13 in April to the recent price of 4.27. A 3rd quarter loss and an earnings miss have led to much selling, not to mention much shorting.</p>

      <p>On the other hand, Citigroup analysts think it may be worth buying. They’ve just upgraded RPC from “sell” to “neutral.” Not a “buy” rating, but a move in the right direction. If even a hint of good news shows up, the massive shorting in the stock is of interest.</p>
      <p><b>Abercrombie &amp; Fitch</b> is the well-known apparel store chain traded on the New York Stock Exchange which now sports a 21.56% short float. Selling at about book value and paying a 4% dividend, that high short interest seems to indicate a certain lack of confidence among some in the ability of the company to increase earnings.</p>

      <p>You can see that it’s one of the stocks not participating in the “new highs” rally for the S&amp;P 500 and other indices. On the other hand, it’s surprising that with that much short interest Abercrombie remains well above the lows it put in back in late 2017.</p>
      <p><b>Tootsie Roll Industries</b> has a 17.43% short float which seems high for such a well known NYSE-traded stock. Earnings have been off lately and although the 5-year record is positive, it’s not positive by much.</p>

      <p>If Halloween sales were good – or better than expected – what could happen here? The company has little debt compared to shareholder equity and they’re still paying a 1% dividend yield.</p>
