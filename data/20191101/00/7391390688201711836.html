      <p>Based on the real-life scams of alleged con artist Anna Delvey, <a href="https://twitter.com/seewhatsnext/status/1190018731348549633">Shonda Rhimes' Netflix series, <i>Inventing Anna</i>, will star Julia Garner</a> as the title character, the streaming service announced via Twitter on Thursday, Oct. 31.<b> </b>Joining the <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/these-2019-emmys-predictions-show-got-is-still-a-favorite-18756751">Emmy-winning <i>Ozark</i> actor</a> in <a href="https://twitter.com/seewhatsnext/status/1190018914668953605">the <i>Inventing Anna</i> cast</a>, per Netflix, is: Anna Chlumsky as Vivian, a reporter "determined to get [Delvey's] story", Laverne Cox as life coach Kacy Duke, Katie Lowes as Delvey worshiper Rachel, and Alexis Floyd as aspiring filmmaker Neff.</p>
      <p>An Oct. 31 tweet from the official Shondaland Twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/byshondaland/status/1190020498614304774">described Garner's Delvey character</a> as "a young woman in her mid-20s with a hard to place European accent who takes New York by storm." The post goes on to summarize Delvey as "either a brilliant business woman or a scammer extraordinaire" who leaves behind "an emotional body count." (Collider previously reported on Oct. 21 that <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/julia-garner-could-play-anna-delvey-in-shonda-rhimes-new-netflix-show-19256614">Garner was in talks to play Delvey</a> in what will be just one of several <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/shonda-rhimes-first-netflix-series-could-be-based-on-intriguing-real-life-woman-9348844">upcoming Shondaland Netflix series</a>.)</p>
      <p><a href="https://tvline.com/2019/10/31/inventing-anna-cast-julia-garner-netflix-shonda-rhimes/">The <i>Inventing Anna</i> logline</a> published by TV Line further describes "the Instagram-infamous German heiress who stole the hearts of New York’s social scene — and stole their money as well" as awaiting trial in the Netflix limited series. Delvey and Chlumsky's journalist character "form a dark funny love-hate bond" as the latter "fights the clock to answer the biggest question in NYC: who is Anna Delvey?"</p>

      <p>The 10-episode Netflix series is inspired by Jessica Pressler's May 2018 <i>New York Magazine</i> article, <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2018/05/how-anna-delvey-tricked-new-york.html">"How Anna Delvey Tricked New York’s Party People</a>." The piece chronicles the real-life alleged scams that led Delvey (AKA <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/anna-delvey-sorokin-trial-soho-grifter-815047/">"Soho Grifter" Anna Sorokin</a>) to be arrested in Oct. 2017 for allegedly "scamming hotels, restaurants, banks and more out of hundreds of thousands of dollars," per <i>The New York Times</i>. A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/09/nyregion/anna-delvey-sorokin-sentenced.html">jury convicted Delvey on eight charges</a>, including grand larceny and theft of services in May 2019, with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/09/nyregion/anna-delvey-sorokin-sentenced.html">a judge sentencing her to four to 12 years in prison</a>. She was further ordered to pay a $24,000 fine and $199,000 in restitution, and, as a Russian national, she faces deportation upon completion of her prison sentence, also according to the newspaper.</p>

AM. SO. EXCITED!!" <a href="https://twitter.com/KatieQLowes/status/1190030582551584768">In a followup tweet, she also joked</a>, "Now I just gotta figure out how to live tweet a Netflix show." Lowes and her other cast mates were famous for live tweeting during <i>Scandal</i>'s Thursday night episodes.</p>

      <p>Neither Netflix nor Shondaland has revealed a projected release date for <i>Inventing Anna</i>, but with a stellar cast now officially in place, the show will likely be available to stream not too far in the future.</p>
