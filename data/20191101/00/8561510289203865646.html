      <h1>China Is Going to the Moon, Coming Back With Moon Rocks</h1>

      <h3>Require More Minerals</h3>
      <p>China has a plan to gather Moon rocks and bring them back to Earth — all using robotic orbiters and rovers.</p>
      <p>The mission, scheduled for late 2020, will be the first to return lunar samples since a Soviet Union mission in 1976, <i><a href="https://spacenews.com/china-targets-late-2020-for-lunar-sample-return-mission/">SpaceNews </a></i><a href="https://spacenews.com/china-targets-late-2020-for-lunar-sample-return-mission/">reports</a>. If the ambitious plan succeeds, scientists will have access to another two kilograms of Moon rocks to study back here on Earth.</p>
      <h3>Moving Parts</h3>
      <p>The mission involves a robotic lunar orbiter serving as the launch and rendezvous point for a vehicle that will send the robotic rover down to the surface of the Moon, where it will gather up some rocks and fly back up before the trip back home.</p>
      <p>As China works towards its plan to build a long-term <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/china-ten-years-have-moon-base">base of operations</a> on the Moon, this mission will help serve as a test run for its space robot tech, according to <i>SpaceNews</i>.</p>
      <p>The mission depends on China finishing assembling and repairing several vehicles, including its Long March 5 rocket, so the schedule is still fairly tentative. But if it all comes together, the new samples could give scientists a much broader wealth of knowledge about our Moon.</p>
