      <p>TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) - No. 21 Arizona has suspended sophomore guard <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/devonaire-doutrive/">Devonaire Doutrive</a> indefinitely for violating unspecified team rules.</p>
      <p>The school announced <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/devonaire-doutrive/">Doutrive</a>’s suspension before Friday night’s exhibition game against Chico State.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/devonaire-doutrive/">Doutrive</a> was a five-star recruit from Southern California in the 2018 class and was expected to have an immediate impact as a freshman. The athletic 6-foot-5 guard showed flashes last season, but was inconsistent, averaging 3.3 points and 3.0 rebounds while playing 26 of 32 games.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/devonaire-doutrive/">Doutrive</a> initially planned to transfer from Arizona this summer before opting to return. Wildcats coach Sean Miller praised <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/devonaire-doutrive/">Doutrive</a>’s improvement heading into this season.</p>
