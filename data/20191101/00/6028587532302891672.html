      <p>It was the transfer saga of last summer.Not a day went by when the issue of who Neymar would be playing for at the start of this season wasn’t discussed.</p>
      <p>Saturation point was reached long before transfer deadline day, with rumour and counter rumour keeping the headline writers busy for days on end.</p>
      <p>The player himself had certainly made a rod for his own back too.</p>
      <p>Suggesting that the best goal he scored in his career came for Barcelona against PSG clearly wasn’t a wise move.</p>
      <p>Nor was publicly claiming he wanted to go ‘back home’ to the Camp Nou.</p>
      <p>Neither statement was going to endear him to a French fanbase that turned out in their droves to greet him on the day he signed, and forced the club shop to order in mammoth extra stocks of his shirt.</p>
      <p>Not anymore.</p>
      <p>Before getting injured, he was still being booed weeks into the season, despite being the match winner on more than one occasion.</p>
      <p>His desperation to leave is only matched, it seems, by the Barcelona players’ desperation to have him back.</p>
      <p>In the murky world of football transfers, there’s no doubt that deals will be done that have been right on the borders of legality.</p>
      <p>But rarely, if ever, can there have been a situation where players of a team are prepared to defer their own salaries in order to ensure a signing takes place.</p>
      <p>Having already acquired Frenkie De Jong and Antoine Griezmann in the last window, Barcelona were looking at a problem with Financial Fair Play if they still wanted to add Neymar to the roster. And at a not insignificant cost of approximately $247.8m.</p>
      <p>From the drip feeding of information available at the time, the suggestion was that Barcelona as a club were doing everything that they possibly could to ensure that ‘Operation Neymar’ was concluded successfully.</p>
      <p>What wasn’t known until the past week was that such a deal included the offer, from senior players, to defer some of their wages, in order to make enough room in the budget to get the deal done.</p>
      <p>Gerard Pique was one of the players who would’ve been happy to help and he was the one to mention that particular part of any potential deal.</p>
      <p>Though he didn’t name any other players, given the closeness that Luis Suarez and Lionel Messi enjoyed with Neymar in a personal and professional sense, one can infer that they’d be similarly happy with the situation.</p>
      <p>Such a revelation does bring a couple of things to the fore.</p>
      <p>In order to make room for the Brazilian, other players would’ve needed to go. Ivan Rakitic and Ousmane Dembele were mentioned as makeweights at the time.</p>
      <p>How are that pair going to feel knowing that their team-mates are doing everything in their power to bring about what would effectively be the termination of their employment with their current club?</p>
      <p>Furthermore, rumours that it’s the senior players running the Barcelona dressing room and not Ernesto Valverde may not be without foundation, given the revelations.</p>
      <p>In any event, the saga still isn’t over and there’s only a few more weeks until the January window opens for business...</p>
