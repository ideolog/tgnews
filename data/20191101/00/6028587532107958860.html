      <p><b>Topline: </b>Screenwriter Aaron Sorkin and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/31/opinion/aaron-sorkin-mark-zuckerberg-facebook.html">took shots</a> at each other <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10110290602526841">this week⁠</a> as Facebook comes under unrelenting scrutiny from lawmakers concerned about the platform’s controversial policy to not fact-check political ads.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>In a Thursday <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/31/opinion/aaron-sorkin-mark-zuckerberg-facebook.html">op-ed</a> for the <i>New York Times</i>, Sorkin said Zuckerberg was “assaulting truth” by claiming Facebook’s political ads are protected by free speech, and therefore do not require fact-checking. </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Zuckerberg fired back using <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10110290602526841">a monologue</a> from one of Sorkin’s own movies⁠—1995’s <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112346/?ref_=nv_sr_1?ref_=nv_sr_1"><i>The American President</i></a>—which he posted to his Facebook page.</li>
        <li>“You want to claim this land as the land of the free? Then the symbol of your country can’t just be a flag; the symbol also has to be one of its citizens exercising his right to burn that flag in protest,” quoted Zuckerberg.</li>
        <li>Zuckerberg appears more aggressive lately in responding to criticism; in October, he also <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10109760864675741">defended</a> meeting with conservative politicians and media, saying “hearing from a wide range of viewpoints is part of learning” and “If you haven’t tried it, I suggest you do!”</li>
        <li>The <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/10/31/america-isnt-easy-facebook-ceo-mocks-social-network-writer/"><i>Washington Post</i></a> reported that Sorkin’s editorial was one of Hollywood’s first attacks on Facebook’s political ad policy.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, the <i>New York Times</i> had to issue three corrections to Sorkin’s op-ed: He got <i>The Social Network’</i>s release year wrong, along with the type of lawsuit that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/12/business/media/thiel-gawker-bid.html">bankrupted</a> Gawker and a statistic about how many Americans get their news from Facebook.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Chief critic: </b>Elizabeth Spiers, Gawker’s founding editor-in-chief, <a href="https://twitter.com/espiers/status/1189903371878182913?s=20">took to Twitter</a> and clarified that the Gawker lawsuit was an invasion of privacy claim, not a defamation claim. She also said that even though Gawker wrote a lot of negative stories, they were not “inherently” defamatory because of their negativity. </p>
      <p><b>Key background:</b> Sorkin won a screenwriting Oscar for <i>The Social Network</i>, a dramatic retelling of Facebook’s founding and the rise of social media. In 2014, Zuckerberg <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/nov/08/mark-zuckerberg-social-network-made-stuff-up-hurtful">said</a> the film “made up a bunch of stuff that I found kind of hurtful.” Since then, Facebook has been resoundly criticized for <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/cambridge-analytica-whistleblower-christopher-wylie-facebook-data-2019-10">upending</a> global politics by allowing the spread of <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/10/tech/facebook-integrity-updates/index.html">misinformation</a>, which it claims it is working to limit ahead of 2020. To protest Facebook’s political ad policy, Elizabeth Warren <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/10/12/elizabeth-warrens-facebook-ad-proves-social-media-giant-still-has-politics-problem/">ran one</a> claiming Facebook had endorsed President Trump and that the platform allows “a candidate to intentionally lie to the American people.” Zuckerberg doubled down on the policy during a Wednesday earnings call, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/10/31/america-isnt-easy-facebook-ceo-mocks-social-network-writer/">saying</a>, “In a democracy, I don’t think it’s right for private companies to censor politicians or the news.”</p>
      <p><b>What to watch for: </b>Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey announced that the social network <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/twitter-political-advertising-ban-51572468100">will ban</a> all political advertising, beginning in November. After Zuckerberg was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/23/technology/facebook-zuckerberg-libra-congress.html">grilled</a> on Capitol Hill last week⁠—and his exchange with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/10/23/20929350/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-mark-zuckerberg-testimony-green-new-deal">went viral⁠</a>—it remains unclear if Facebook will alter its political advertising policy. </p>
      <p><b>Tangent:</b> Zuckerberg didn’t have a particularly great time <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/lisettevoytko/2019/10/25/heres-how-bad-mark-zuckerbergs-week-was/#5fa858cd3df6">last week</a>, either. </p>
