      <p>LONDON (AP) — British euroskeptic politician Nigel Farage is launching his party’s election campaign, a day after U.S. President Donald Trump urged him to make an electoral pact with Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Conservatives.</p>
      <p>Farage’s Brexit Party rejects Johnson’s divorce deal with the European Union and wants to leave the bloc with no agreement on future relations.</p>
      <p>Farage, who played a key role in the campaign for Britain to leave the EU, hasn’t revealed whether his party will contest all 650 House of Commons seats up for grabs, or pick a few where it has a chance of winning.</p>
      <p>Running in a small number of seats would help the Conservatives, who are vying with Farage for the support of Brexit-backing voters.</p>

        <p>Farage said Friday there’s a need for “some kind of Brexit alliance.”</p>
