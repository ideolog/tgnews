      <p>MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) - A public works department in Vermont says it’s seeking more staff to reduce stress and massive overtime claims, particularly in winter.</p>
      <p>The Times Argus reports Montpelier’s department asked the City Council to hire at least one more full-time employee.</p>
      <p>Public works director Donna Barlow Casey told councilors Wednesday that last winter’s overtime demands exceeded 3,700 hours and doubled the budget to more than $120,000.</p>
      <p>Department officials say staffing issues led to summer street maintenance delays as workers postponed vacation time to meet winter demands.</p>
      <p>The council has said an expected 25% increase in health costs next year exceeds what it’s willing to approve, unless other services are cut.</p>
