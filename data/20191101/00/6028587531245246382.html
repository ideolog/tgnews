      <h3>Key News</h3>
      <p>Asian markets were largely up as China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea, Singapore and India all had equity market gains. Japan, Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand were off while the Philippine markets were closed. China and Hong Kong had multiple catalysts the first being the Caixin PMI, discussed below. We also had the 4<sup>th</sup> Plenum press release which indicates that supportive policies will remain in place. Another catalyst was news that Henderson Land (12 HK) will be donating land to the Hong Kong government for public housing. We have written at length that an element of Hong Kong’s unrest is driven by wealth inequality and a lack of affordable housing. Addressing housing would go a long way to ending protests which are driven today by students on the weekend. One should expect more of real estate companies to follow Henderson’s lead.US equity markets were off yesterday with US-listed Chinese stocks off as well on reports of a Bloomberg article on trade talks deteriorating from leaked China sources. I highly doubt this is true as a leak would be a major coup for the journalist. Bloomberg News is persona non-gratis in China after publishing a list of the richest Chinese including several government-linked figures. There is no chance they would use Bloomberg as a leak source. Over the weekend, China confirmed Phase One was a done deal. Concessions from both sides are required for the trade agreement to move past phase one.</p>
      <p>Mainland China was weak this week as liquidity conditions have been tight in China. Tax payments are due at month end, which will pull money out of the system, while PBOC has not filled the gap.</p>
      <h3>Caixin Manufacturing PMI</h3>
      <p>51.7 versus estimate 51 and August’s 51.4</p>
      <p>Takeaway: Stimulus policies have been directed toward private companies versus state owned enterprises as private companies have historically had trouble accessing credit. The PBOC has cut the bank reserve requirement ratio over the last year while directing the banks to lend the freed-up cash to private companies. The Caixin PMI focuses on private companies versus the “official” National Bureau of Statistics PMI, which focuses large companies. The Caixin is a much smaller survey versus the NBS number, which disappointed on Wednesday. Today’s release provides evidence that policies directed toward supporting private companies are working.</p>
