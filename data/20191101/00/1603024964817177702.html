      <p>Chennai-based Union of IT/ITeS Employees (UNITE) has condemned the proposed layoff of 7,000 employees by US-based IT major Cognizant and has called for unionisation of tech workers.</p>
      <p>Cognizant in its earnings call said that the company is <a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/cognizant-to-cut-7000-mid-to-senior-level-jobs-exit-content-operation-biz-4588841.html">looking at a net reduction of 7,000 employees</a> at the mid-to-senior level to pare down cost. As it exits the content moderation business, another 6,000 employees are also likely to be affected.</p>
      <p>This move is likely affect the Indian market the most, given that most of its workforce is based in India.</p>

      <p>In a statement, UNITE said Cognizant has announced layoffs despite the fact that the firm has reported strong earnings for the quarter-ended September. “UNITE sees this proposed act of mass retrenchment of its employees, despite a strong quarter result, as a motive for profit-maximization, ignoring the lives of its employees and their families,” the statement said.</p>
      <p>For the third-quarter ended September, Cognizant registered a revenue of $4.25 billion, up 4.2 percent from the comparable quarter last year. Its net profit stood at $497 million compared to $477 million in the comparable quarter last year. Operating margin stood at 17.3 percent compared to 18.5 percent in the year ago quarter.</p>
      <p>The management said it expects an annual revenue savings of $500-550 million as it continues to reduce manpower cost at the senior level and also exit from business that are not in line with its strategy such as content moderation.</p>
      <p>There have also been reports that employees, who were unable to upskill and are on the bench for a long time, are likely to be laid off.</p>
      <p>It is in this context that Alagunambi Welkin, General Secretary, UNITE, called for unionisation similar to that initiated by workers of HCL America to fight for their rights.</p>
      <p>In a first, close to <a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/hcl-tech-google-workers-unionisation-why-this-could-spread-further-in-us-4482131.html">80 techies from HCL America</a> joined a United Steelworkers (USW) union in the US in late September to demand better working conditions and other employee benefits.</p>
      <p>Welkin said Indian workers who were working in the content moderation business too were under similar stress and need to be protected. “With the implementation of artificial intelligence/machine learning as part of World Economic Forum's Fourth Industrial Revolution vision, where the low-end IT and ITeS jobs are getting automated, it is the need of the hour to unite and protect jobs through collective bargaining,” he added.</p>
      <p>“UNITE invites the Cognizant Technology Solutions employees to join UNITE and practice trade unionism to win their rights,” the statement added.<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/promos/pro.php"><b>Special Thursday Expiry on <s>10<sup>th</sup></s> 7<sup>th</sup> Nov</b><br/>Early Closure to The Great Diwali Discount.
