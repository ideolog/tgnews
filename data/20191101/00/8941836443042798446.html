      <p>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) - Formula One and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/espn/">ESPN</a> have agreed to a new three-year deal to keep the series on the network and on ABC in the United States.</p>
      <p>The deal, announced Friday ahead of the U.S. Grand Prix, also makes ESPN Deportes the Spanish-language home of F1 in the U.S.</p>
      <p>ESPN will continue to air races commercial-free using broadcast partner Sky Sports. The new deal keeps all races live on <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/espn/">ESPN</a>, ESPN2 or ABC. Practice sessions and qualifying will continue to be aired across ESPN platforms.</p>
      <p>Formula One moved to ESPN from NBC after 2017. ESPN had broadcast F1 from 1984 to 1997 and ABC aired the first broadcast of the U.S. Grand Prix in 1962.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/espn/">ESPN</a> said race viewership has averaged 671,000 through 18 races this year, an increase of 19%t over 2018.</p>

      <p>“When we brought Formula 1 back to ESPN two years ago, we had faith that Formula One fans in the United States would support the coverage,” said Burke Magnus, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/espn/">ESPN</a> executive vice president, programming and scheduling. “That faith has been rewarded many times over, and we greatly appreciate how fans have responded in record numbers.”</p>
