      <h1>Spanking ineffective, leads to worse behavior in children: Study</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T00:00:00+00:00">01 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/staff/bailey-vogt/" target="_blank">Bailey Vogt</a></address>
      <p>Spanking children as a form of discipline will inspire more bad behavior, a new study based on 50 years of research found.</p>
      <p>The University of Texas at Austin and the University of Michigan conducted a  <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Ffam0000191">joint study</a> of more than 160,000 children and found that spanking was less likely to lead to good behaviors and more likely to cause anti-social behavior, aggression and cognitive difficulties.</p>
      <p>“Spanking increases the likelihood of a wide variety of undesired outcomes for children. Spanking thus does the opposite of what parents usually want it to do,” said Dr. Andrew Gorgan-Kaylor, a University of Michigan researcher with a doctorate in philosophy in social welfare, an NBC News affiliate in Charlotte  <a href="https://www.wcnc.com/article/news/health/study-finds-spanking-increases-mental-health-issues-in-children/67-7a99f890-a19b-4c00-89fc-6d323ec828cd">reported</a>.</p>
      <p>While family science experts differentiated spanking from child abuse, they found the effects of the trauma were basically the same.</p>
      <p>Spanking has become a less popular form of punishment in the U.S. over the years, with the University of New Hampshire <a href="http://unh.edu/ccrc/pdf/CV358%20-%20Published%202019.pdf">reporting</a> only 37% of parents use the disciplinary technique.</p>

      <p>Around the world, however, UNICEF <a href="https://data.unicef.org/topic/child-protection/violence/violent-discipline/">reports</a> that 80% of households spank their children.</p>
