      <p>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) - A series of defense motions are set to be heard in the case of the man accused of killing 17 people at a Florida high school last year.</p>
      <p>Two court hearings are scheduled Friday for 21-year-old Nikolas Cruz, who faces the death penalty if convicted in the February 2018 massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.</p>
      <p>The defense motions include attempts to prevent prosecutors from seeking the death penalty and to dismiss a charge of attempted battery against a jail corrections officer after the shootings.</p>
      <p>Cruz’s lawyers have said he will plead guilty to the school shooting in exchange for a life prison sentence, but Broward County prosecutors have rejected that offer.</p>
