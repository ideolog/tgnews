      <p>TOKYO (AP) - Britain’s Royal Family is getting excited about England’s appearance in the Rugby World Cup final - even its most recent arrival.</p>

      <p>Included in the message was a photo of the prince’s 5-month-old son, Archie, in an England jersey.</p>
      <p>“A nice touch,” England flanker Sam Underhill said Friday.</p>
