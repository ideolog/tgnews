      <p>SALEM, Mass. (AP) - A Massachusetts man accused of killing a retired town official has pleaded not guilty.</p>
      <p>Leedell Graham, of Haverhill, pleaded not guilty to murder charges Thursday in Salem Superior Court in the beating death of 82-year-old Patsy Schena at his Groveland home on June 21.</p>
      <p>The Salem News reports 48-year-old Graham was indicted by a grand jury on the murder charge, as well as counts of home invasion and breaking and entering to commit a felony in October.</p>
      <p>Schena was the town’s retired building inspector and police say he and Graham knew each other through “business dealings” unrelated to the town.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors asked for Graham to continue being held without bail and his attorney did not object but asked the judge to issue the order without prejudice.</p>
