      <p>PORTLAND, Maine (AP) - Half of a historic Maine Island known as the “Ellis Island of the North” has been sold for $4.5 million.</p>
      <p>The Portland Press Herald reports Portland entrepreneur Noah Gordon bought 12 acres (5 hectares) on House Island. The sale closed last week.</p>
      <p>A marketing manager with Re/Max by the Bay’s David Banks Team, Ana Piper, says the portion sold had been owned by two companies that rented space for weddings and other events.</p>
      <p>The land sold includes a four-bedroom main lodge, a small house and a cottage. The property is known for a federal immigration quarantine center that operated from 1907-1937.</p>
      <p>Gordon says he plans to turn House Island into the “premier private island hospitality event venue in America.”</p>
