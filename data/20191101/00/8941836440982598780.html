      <p>MENOMONIE, Wis. (AP) - A jury returned a guilty verdict Friday for a Wisconsin woman who stabbed her ex-boyfriend 16 times and then, prosecutors said, concocted a phony story of self-defense that included carving the word “boy” in her arm.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ezra-mccandless/">Ezra McCandless</a>, 22, was convicted of first-degree intentional homicide, with use of a dangerous weapon, for the March 2018 death of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/alex-woodworth/">Alex Woodworth</a>, 24. Prosecutors said <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ezra-mccandless/">McCandless</a> killed <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/alex-woodworth/">Woodworth</a> in a desperate attempt to rekindle a relationship with another man. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ezra-mccandless/">McCandless</a> testified that she stabbed <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/alex-woodworth/">Woodworth</a> in self-defense.</p>
      <p>She faces life in prison when sentenced.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ezra-mccandless/">McCandless</a>, of Stanley, was charged after authorities found <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/alex-woodworth/">Woodworth</a>’s body in the back seat of her car on March 23, 2018. Prosecutors said <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ezra-mccandless/">McCandless</a> stabbed <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/alex-woodworth/">Woodworth</a> 16 times and staged a phony scene to bolster a self-defense claim.</p>
      <p>The defense argued that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/alex-woodworth/">Woodworth</a> was fascinated with violence and cannibalism and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ezra-mccandless/">McCandless</a> feared she’d be raped. When she testified at trial, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ezra-mccandless/">McCandless</a> told the jury she was afraid <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/alex-woodworth/">Woodworth</a> was going to kill her, so she stabbed him in self-defense.</p>

      <p>In a strange twist, when <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ezra-mccandless/">McCandless</a> went to get help, the word “boy” was carved into her arm. She initially said <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/alex-woodworth/">Woodworth</a> did it - a reference to the fact that she used to identify as male. But she later admitted she did it herself.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ezra-mccandless/">McCandless</a>, who at one point was in relationships with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/alex-woodworth/">Woodworth</a> and two other men at once, testified she had gone to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/alex-woodworth/">Woodworth</a>’s home in Eau Claire on March 22, 2018, to get clothing and check on him after their recent breakup. She said they went for a drive and got stuck in the mud. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ezra-mccandless/">McCandless</a> testified that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/alex-woodworth/">Woodworth</a> attempted to rape her, cut off her clothes and began pricking her skin with a knife. She said she kneed him in the groin and got the knife from him.</p>
      <p>“As <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/alex-woodworth/">Alex</a> was grabbing me I started stabbing him anywhere and everywhere I could,” she testified.</p>

        <p>She also testified that went she went for help, she did not say she had stabbed <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/alex-woodworth/">Woodworth</a>. She also didn’t tell police or emergency workers about the stabbing. She testified that the knife was her father’s - not <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/alex-woodworth/">Woodworth</a>’s - and was already in the car.</p>
