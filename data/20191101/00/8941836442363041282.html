      <p>NEW YORK (AP) - About 1,000 people protesting what they say is New York police brutality marched through downtown Brooklyn, chanting “no justice, no peace!”</p>
      <p>The peaceful protesters filled main avenues Friday evening as they passed the Barclays Center arena where the Brooklyn Nets play. The march came several days after a video emerged on social media showing police officers fighting with teenagers inside city subway stations.</p>
      <p>Marchers say they oppose what they consider over-policing of the subway system.</p>
      <p>The protest comes after a period in which the New York Police Department has been under scrutiny for several shootings of armed civilians.</p>
