      <h1>Scientists Have Made a Blueprint For a Quantum Battery That Never Loses Charge</h1>

      <p>A team of scientists from the universities of Alberta and Toronto have laid out the blueprints for a "quantum battery" that never loses its charge.</p>
      <p>To be clear, this battery doesn't exist yet — but if they figure out how to build it, it could be a revolutionary breakthrough in energy storage.</p>
      <p>"The batteries that we are more familiar with — like the lithium-ion battery that powers your smartphone — rely on classical electrochemical principles, whereas quantum batteries rely solely on quantum mechanics," University of Alberta chemist Gabriel Hanna said in <a href="https://phys.org/news/2019-10-blueprint-quantum-battery-doesnt.html">a statement</a>.</p>
      <h3>Dark State</h3>
      <p><a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b06373">A paper</a> describing the research was published in the <i>Journal of Physical Chemistry C</i>. in July. The battery works by harnessing the power of "excitonic energy" — the state in which an electron absorbs sufficiently charged photons of light.</p>
      <p>The researchers found that their resulting battery model should be "highly robust to energy losses," thanks to the fact that their battery is prepared inside a "dark state" where it cannot exchange energy — by absorbing or releasing photons — with its surroundings.</p>
      <h3>Large Charge</h3>
      <p>By breaking down this "dark state" quantum network, the researchers claim the battery could be able to discharge and release energy in the process.</p>
      <p>But the team has yet to come up with viable ways of doing so. They will also have to figure out a way to scale the technology for real-world applications as well.</p>
