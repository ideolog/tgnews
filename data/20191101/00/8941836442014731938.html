      <p>MARTIN, S.D. (AP) - State officials say chronic wasting disease in deer has spread eastward in South Dakota.</p>
      <p>The state Game, Fish and Parks Department said Friday samples collected from a sick deer found near Martin in Bennett County confirmed the animal was in the late stages of the disease.</p>
      <p>The agency says it’s the first confirmed case of chronic wasting disease in free-ranging deer or elk in Bennett County.</p>
      <p>Chronic wasting disease is a fatal brain condition in deer, elk and moose. It has previously been found in deer and elk in southwestern South Dakota.</p>
