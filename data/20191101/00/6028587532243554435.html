      <p><b>Topline</b>: Former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke is dropping out of the 2020 presidential race, he announced on Friday, after he failed to gain momentum and enough funding to keep his campaign afloat.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Despite drawing national attention and millions in funding during his 2018 senate run against Ted Cruz, O’Rourke wasn’t able to carry that fervor into the presidential race. </li>
        <li>He will not run for any other office in 2020, the<i> New York Times</i> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/01/us/politics/beto-orourke-drops-out.html">reported</a>, even though some of his donors had wanted him run against John Cornyn for Senate.</li>
        <li>“Though it is difficult to accept, it is clear to me now that this campaign does not have the means to move forward successfully,” he wrote in a Medium post.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Key background</b>: O’Rourke sought to distinguish himself and gain momentum in the last months of his campaign by taking a strong stance on gun control in the wake of the El Paso shooting. Still, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren and South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg have surged while O’Rourke struggled to break out.</p>
