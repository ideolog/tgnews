      <h1>Astronomers Spot Black Hole the Size of Manhattan</h1>

      <h3>Very Big, Very Small</h3>
      <p>Black holes can get very big — in some instances, <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/an-absolutely-gargantuan-black-hole-has-been-found-as-massive-as-40-billion-suns">big enough</a> to encompass the orbits of all our solar system’s planets.</p>
      <p>But not all are huge. Yesterday, <a href="https://futurism.com/scientists-new-class-black-holes">we wrote</a> about a <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/366/6465/637">new study</a> by a team of astronomers from Ohio State University led by astronomer Todd Thompson, claiming to have discovered an entirely new and previously missing class of black holes.</p>
      <p>The extensive investigation, using data from a high-resolution infrared spectronomy instrument, found a black hole a mere 3.3 times the mass of the Sun. That may not sound very small, but it’s vastly smaller than previously discovered specimens.</p>
      <p>And now we have an estimate for the diameter of such a relatively tiny black hole. Today, <i>MIT Technology Review</i> <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/f/614664/scientists-have-spotted-a-tiny-black-hole-that-may-be-just-12-miles-across/">reported</a><a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/f/614664/scientists-have-spotted-a-tiny-black-hole-that-may-be-just-12-miles-across/"> that</a> the discovered black hole is a mere 12 miles across — roughly the length of Manhattan.</p>
      <h3>12 Mile</h3>
      <p>Futurism reached out to Thompson to confirm <i>MIT Tech</i>‘s reporting.</p>
      <p>“Since the black hole mass has some degree of uncertainty, these are all reasonable numbers,” he wrote in an email. “The Schwarzschild radius for a 3.3 Msun [solar mass] black hole is about 10km. So, the diameter is about 20 km. That’s about 12 miles in diameter.”</p>
      <p>If Thompson’s calculations are correct, this new class of black holes could force us to rethink how we understand the way stars and other kinds of celestial objects are born and die.</p>
