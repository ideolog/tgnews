      <p><b><i>Fed Cuts Interest Rates, But Indicates A Pause Is Ahead</i></b>The Federal Reserve approved an expected quarter-point interest rate cut Wednesday but indicated that the moves to ease policy could be nearing a pause. The central bank's Federal Open Market Committee lowered its benchmark funds rate by 25 basis points to a range of 1.5% to 1.75%. It was the third cut this year.

          <i>Online Banking Has Become More Widespread Among Consumers</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>A new survey from Provident Bank might help explain why bank branches are disappearing. Consumers have gotten into the habit of doing their banking digitally, and they strongly prefer it. Only 20% of the consumers in the survey said they would rather visit a bank location than do their business using digital channels. Consumers appear satisfied with their current financial institutions' digital banking offerings: 66% said their bank or credit union's online services met their needs. Banks' online services are proving to be an effective customer retention tool, with 82% of bank customers mentioning their financial institution's online and mobile platforms as a major reason they haven't switched banks.

          <i>Kroger Lifts Ban On Visa Credit Cards At Smith's And Food Co. Stores</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Kroger, the nation's largest grocer, is reversing its ban on <a href="https://www.lowcards.com/visa/">Visa credit cards</a> that affected a small number of its stores. The company, which operates under several subsidiaries, had started banning use of the Visa card in its small Foods Co. chain in California in August 2018. It expanded the ban in April to the larger Smith's Food &amp; Drug Store chain. Smith's ban on Visa spanned 142 supermarket and 108 fuel center locations across seven states. Kroger had said it was banning Visa to save money on processing fees and keep groceries low.

          <i>Uber Money Is The Company's Latest Attempt To Expand Into Financial Services</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Uber is creating a new division called Uber Money to handle its growing financial services business. The group will oversee everything from the company's credit and debit card offerings, to digital wallets for riders, to products used by drivers to get paid in a timely manner. Typically drivers either wait for weekly payments or cash out using a feature called Instant Pay. Now, drivers and other freelance workers like Uber Eats couriers will have real-time access to their earnings after every trip through the Uber Debit account. This mobile bank account will mean that Uber's 4-million-plus drivers and couriers can get their money instantly after every trip or delivery.

      </p>
      <p>Getting a <a href="http://www.lowcards.com/">good credit card</a> is now a little easier for certain newcomers to the U.S. who already have good credit in other countries. American Express has launched a new feature with international credit-reporting startup Nova Credit that allows immigrants and expats in the U.S. to instantly translate certain international credit reports into U.S.-equivalent credit reports when applying for an AmEx consumer credit card. Currently, the feature can access credit reports from five foreign credit bureaus, one in each of these five countries: Australia, Canada, India, Mexico and the United Kingdom.

      </p>
      <p>Venmo is launching Venmo Rewards, a rewards program for its physical Venmo debit card. The program will give you automatic cash back at certain retailers if you pay with the Venmo card. It will initially earn you 5% cash back at Target, Sephora, and Wendy's, and 4% cash back at Dunkin'. These are "limited-time offers" and new offers will be added on an ongoing basis. Any cash back will be deposited straight into your Venmo account.

          <i>The Uber Credit Card Just Got A Refresh With Improved Bonus Categories</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>The Uber credit card from Barclays has been a strong cash-back credit card ever since it launched in 2019. One "quirk" is that it's offered a higher cash-back rate on dining purchases (4% back) than on Uber spending (2% back), but that's changing now. You'll now earn 5% back on all Uber purchases and 3% back on restaurants, bars, hotels, airfare, and vacation rentals. This means the Uber Visa is now the most rewarding cash-back card for Uber purchases. Instead of earning cash back, the Uber card now earns Uber Cash, which you can only redeem with Uber, not for cash back or gift cards.

      </p>
      <p>China is preparing for the launch of its own state-backed cryptocurrency by removing online posts claiming that blockchain technology is a scam. It marks a significant shift in the country's policy towards blockchain and comes just days after President Xi Jinping hailed it as an "important breakthrough" that should be developed. China's central bank began exploring the possibility of creating a cryptocurrency in 2014, however bitcoin exchanges and other cryptocurrency platforms in the country were effectively banned.

      <p><a href="https://www.lowcards.com/master-card/">Mastercard</a> is venturing into a new avenue which, at first, sounds far removed from its primary business model. Mastercard will be looking to the blockchain to bring visibility to food systems and supply chain, with the integration of Envisble's Wholechain system. A growing desire from consumers to know the story behind what they eat has prompted Mastercard to go down this burgeoning market.
