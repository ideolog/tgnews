      <p>Shopping for the perfect gift for the tech-loving gentleman in your life? Sometimes it can be tough to find a gift that he’ll really like, but thankfully, you don’t necessarily have to spend thousands of dollars. We’ve done the research so that you don’t have to. Here are the best tech gifts for men.</p>
      <h3>Apple iPad</h3>

      <p>The iPad is one of the most versatile gifts you could give. Into reading? You can use it to read e-books. Prefer to watch movies on your downtime? Netflix and Amazon Prime Video work perfect here. Or perhaps you simply want to browse social media and research things on the Web. Check. The entry-level iPad offers an Apple A10 Fusion chip, along with a 10.2-inch display and a classic design that anyone will love. The battery will get you through up to 10 hours of use too, which is more than enough for most days.</p>

      <p>Music streaming services are great, but there’s nothing quite like the sound and routine of playing vinyl records. Audio Technica makes plenty of great turntables, like the Audio Technica AT-LP60-BT, which allows you to easily play at both 33-1/3 and 45 RPM. Not only that, but this player has a slightly high-tech touch too, offering Bluetooth connectivity that allows you to listen through a Bluetooth speaker or Bluetooth headphones.</p>

      <p>Speaking of wireless speakers, perhaps the best one out there is the Sonos One. The Sonos One is not only pretty well-designed, coming in a sleek black or white color-scheme, but it’s smart too – offering either Google Assistant or Alexa built right into the speaker. Even better is the fact that the speaker sounds great, offering plenty of bass, a well-tuned midrange, and a ton of clarity and detail in the high frequencies.</p>
