      <h1>Android Circuit: New Galaxy S11 Leaks, Google Power Inside Honor 9X, Razer Fights AirPods</h1>

      <p>Taking a look back at seven days of news and headlines across the world of Android, this week’s Android Circuit includes new Galaxy S11 details, another Galaxy Fold design, the Nokia 7.2 reviewed, Honor 9X and Google’s Mobile Services, the new Moto Razr leaks, Pixel 4 battery problems, Alphabet’s purchase of FitBit, new Razer earbuds, and increased support for Primephonic.Android Circuit is here to remind you of a few of the many things that have happened around Android in the last week (<a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/ewanspence/2019/11/01/apple-news-headlines-iphone-12-leak-rumor-iphone-11-battery-ios13-macos-catalina-airpods-pro/">and you can find the weekly Apple news digest here</a>).</p>

        <b>Galaxy S11 Camera Software Exposed?</b>
      </p>
      <p>We already know that Samsung is planning a larger screen for next year’s flagship Galaxy S11 handsets. Now, looking at the beta of the One UI code, it look like low light and nightie photography will also play a key part. The camera software is preparing for devices with high ISO values and extra-long shutter durations, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ewanspence/2019/10/28/samsung-galaxy-s11-camera-iso-exposure-one-ui-beta-confirmed-specs/">as I reported earlier this week</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>…Samsung has upped the exposure time in the app to thirty seconds, with the ISO pushed up to 3200. In practice this means the shutter can stay open far longer to gathering more light into the sensor, perfect for night shots and dark environments, The higher ISO also helps in low light environments. Paired together this opens up many artistic choices for photographers.</blockquote>

        <b>Another Way To Fold Your Galaxy</b>
      </p>
      <p>Meanwhile Samsung took time out at its recent Developers Conference to show off some new form factors of its smartphones, revealing a new design of folding phone. Unlike the now launch Galaxy Fold’s book spine approach, this demo showed a fold based around the flip-phone form factor. <a href="https://nl.letsgodigital.org/smartphones/samsung-opvouwbare-klaptelefoon/">Ilse Jurrien reports</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>The 24-second YouTube video shows the folding mechanism and how the user interface changes at the time of folding. What is also striking is the punch-hole camera, which is placed at the top in the middle - just like with the Galaxy Note 10 . The huge notch of the Samsung Galaxy Fold is therefore canceled.</blockquote>

        <b>Nokia 7.2 Pitches Itself As An All-Rounder</b>
      </p>
      <p>HMD Global’s Nokia 7.2 handset is fighting in a particularly crowded mid-range market of smartphones in the run up to the holidays, and like every handset it has made choices on where to be a champion, where to compromise, or i it would look to be an all-rounder. <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/nokia_7_2-review-2010.php">For the team at GSM Arena</a>, the 7.2 has chosen the latter approach and he’s not sure it has worked out.</p>
      <blockquote>The Nokia 7.2 looked like a promising phone on paper, and we hoped it would offer the same understated goodness that we remember the 7 plus for. That ended up not being the case though.<br/>For the price Nokia is asking for the 7.2 you can have better camera quality, superior display, longer battery life, beefier chipset - often more than one of these on the same phone. As such, the 7.2 is hard to recommend to anyone but the die-hard brand loyalist on a budget.</blockquote>

        <b>Honor 9X And Google Mobile Services</b>
      </p>
      <p>Following last week’s launch of the Honor 9X, a number of eyebrows were raised that the handset was running Google’s flavor of Android. With Honor’s parent company Huawei listed on the US Entities list, how can Google Mobile Services (GMS) be included? <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/huawei-release-phones-with-google-apps-1046423/">Robert Triggs explains</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>It turns out the European Honor 9X’s model number is identical to the Huawei P Smart Z. This phone launched back in May 2019 and, not coincidentally, was Huawei’s first smartphone with a pop-up selfie camera. The two phones share a number of other hardware similarities…<br/>In a nutshell, GMS certification is not dependant on the aesthetics of a device, but rather just parts of the internal hardware and the market. Keep these the same, and manufacturers are free to change the exterior design all they want.</blockquote>

        <b>Folding Over The Moto Razr Leaks</b>
      </p>
      <p>Following on from the first images of the Folding Moto Razr smartphone, the geekerati have had a closer look at the handset thanks to a treasure trove of images found online. <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/10/31/motorola-razr-folding-specs-images-leak/">Ben Schoon examines the leaked details to see what Motorola has planed</a>:</p>
      <blockquote><a href="https://www.mobielkopen.net/beelden-opvouwbare-motorola-razr">Mobielkopen</a> posted a gallery of images of the upcoming Razr smartphone, which pretty much bares all when it comes to the design of the device. Based on one of the images, we’re guessing these are sourced from a registration page that was accessed early.<br/>We can see the folding design and complete display inside as well as an outer display and the limited buttons along the side as well.</blockquote>

        <b>Pixel 4 Problems</b>
      </p>
      <p>Following the launch of Google’s Pixel 4 and Pixel 4XL, the handsets have not been given an easy ride from the critics. From issues with white balance, through awkward notifications, to gimmicky gestures, Mountain View’s handset is not quite matching up to the competition. Then there’s the battery life. <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/features/pixel-4-battery-life-is-the-biggest-reason-not-to-buy-it">Mark Spoonauer reports</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>With its 2,800 mAh battery, the Pixel 4's capacity is less than the Pixel 3's 2,915 mAh battery. So it wasn't a big surprise that this phone turned in a shorter runtime on the Tom's Guide battery test, which involves continuous web surfing at 150 nits of screen brightness. We use T-Mobile's network for our testing to be consistent across phones.<br/>The Pixel 4 lasted only 8 hours and 3 minutes on our battery test, which is well below the handsets on our best phone battery life list and most competing flagships. For example, the iPhone 11 lasted 11:16 while the iPhone 11 Pro (with a similar size display to the Pixel 4) lasted 10:24. That's about two and a half hours longer endurance from Apple's phone.</blockquote>

        <b>Why The Fitbit May Not Be A Success With Google </b>
      </p>
      <p>Alphabet, Google’s parent company, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidphelan/2019/11/01/google-buys-fitbit-for-21-billion-heres-what-it-means/">has purchased Fitbit</a> to help with its stalled strategy around wearables. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/29/20937257/google-fitbit-wear-os-qualcomm-processors-fitness-strategy-acquistion">Dieter Bohn looks at the potential from the addition to the Android champions</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>Assuming it bears out, I think that this acquisition portends a wearables reboot instead of shoring up Google’s current smartwatch strategy. I think that mainly because Google’s current smartwatch strategy isn’t helped by Fitbit — at all. Unless Google has completely lost the thread, this acquisition only makes sense if the company is ready to try something completely different.<br/>It certainly should be.</blockquote>

        <b>New Razer Ear Buds Support Mobile Gaming</b>
      </p>
      <p>This week saw gaming lifestyle brand Razer launch its Hammerhead headphones for smartphone gamers. The buds sit in your ear much like the standard AirPods from Apple (and are the obvious comparison to make) but the big selling point is ‘game mode’, which reduces the latency down to 60 ms to sync with the action on screen. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/29/20937068/razer-truly-wireless-headphones-hammerhead-bluetooth-5-earbuds-android-gaming-mode-price">Cameron Faulkner reports</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>These new truly wireless earbuds, which Razer announced today, have a minuscule 60ms latency once “Gaming Mode” is enabled via a dedicated app for iOS and Android. The result should align what you’re hearing with what is on the screen. Razer claims that its earbuds utilize a customized version of Bluetooth 5.0 to allow this feature to work and to preserve audio quality and battery life in the low-latency mode. To turn it on, just tap three times on the earbud.</blockquote>
