      <p>SAO PAULO: Wildfires are raging across the Pantanal tropical wetlands in southern Brazil, one of the most biodiverse areas in the world and a major tourist destination, regional authorities said on Thursday (Oct 31).</p>
      <p>The governor's office in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul said the fires were "bigger than anything seen before" in the region.</p>

      <p>So far, more than 50,000 hectares have been affected.</p>
      <p>The blazes follow other wildfires that environmental groups say ravaged millions of hectares in the Amazon rainforest in August.</p>
      <p>The statement from the governor's office said the situation was "critical," with blazes ravaging three towns in the Pantanal, a popular eco-tourism spot.</p>

      <p>"Intense flames and reddish smoke have disrupted traffic" on the highways, the statement said.</p>
      <p>The coordinator of the National Risk Management Center, Paulo Barbosa de Souza, said the blaze -Â fed by wind and dry vegetation - was causing "logistical difficulties."</p>
      <p>Satellite images from the INPE space institute showed there were nearly 8,500 fires in the Pantanal area between January and October this year.</p>
      <p>That was the worst record since 2007.</p>
