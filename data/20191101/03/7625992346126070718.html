      <h1>Actor James Cromwell arrested during PETA protest at Texas A&amp;M</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T03:35:53+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 03:35</time> by <a rel="author">CBS/AP</a></address>
      <p>Actor <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/james-cromwell-arrested-new-york-power-plant-protest/">James Cromwell</a> and another man have been charged with disorderly conduct after police said they disrupted a meeting of the Texas A&amp;M University System Board of Regents. The two were part of a demonstration Thursday by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, or PETA, to protest A&amp;M's use of dogs for medical research. </p>
      <p>The 79-year-old actor, who is an animal welfare activist, and 34-year-old Jeremy Beckham were released after posting bonds of $5,000 each. Hindering proceedings by disorderly conduct is punishable by up to a year in jail.</p>
      <p>In a statement issued before the demonstration, Cromwell said that "caging and hurting golden retrievers is unethical and bad science, and it needs to end now."</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.peta.org/media/news-releases/james-cromwell-arrested-protesting-texas-am-universitys-dog-laboratory/">a statement on PETA's website</a>, the protest aimed to shut down a university laboratory "where golden retrievers and other dogs who were bred to have canine muscular dystrophy struggle to walk, swallow, and even breathe." </p>
      <p>"Texas A&amp;M continues to torment golden retrievers and other dogs, even though decades of these experiments have not led to a cure for humans with muscular dystrophy," Cromwell said in the PETA statement. "It's time to let the dogs out, and my friends at PETA and I want them released to good homes where they can live out the rest of their lives in peace."</p>
      <p>Texas A&amp;M University announced recently that it was reducing its breeding of dogs for medical research, but the group wants the experiments to stop entirely.</p>
