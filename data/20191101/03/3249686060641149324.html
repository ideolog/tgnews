      <p>After the grand finale of <b>Mnet</b>'s '<b>Queendom</b>' on October 31, many netizens took note of <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/gi-dle">(G)I-DLE</a> member <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/shuhua">Shuhua</a>'s ferocious performance!</p>
      <p>Some claimed that earlier in (G)I-DLE's career, Shuhua was arguably named a <i>"useless member"</i> in the group. However, after the group's performance of "<b>Lion</b>" today, netizens collectively agreed that <i>"Shuhua's gaze has changed TT"</i>!</p>
