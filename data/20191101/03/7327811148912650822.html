      <p>FORDHAM, Bronx (WABC) -- A 14-year-old boy was injured in a shooting on a Bronx street Thursday, police said.</p>
      <p>The incident happened just after 3 p.m. on Creston Avenue in the Fordham section.</p>
      <p>The teen was shot in the leg while standing in front of a six-story building near East 193rd Street, directly across from St. James Park.</p>
      <p>The circumstances that led to the shooting are not yet known. There have been no arrests.</p>
      <p>The boy was taken to St. Barnabas Hospital in stable condition.</p>
      <p>The shooting sparked more fear and frustration in the neighborhood, as residents besieged by violence said they need help.</p>
      <p>One bullet crashed through a laundromat window, shattered a second interior window, and landed in the doorjam of a small pizzeria on Jerome Avenue.</p>
      <p>School had just let out, and in surveillance camera video obtained by Eyewitness News, people could be seen running from the gunfire.</p>
      <p>Then, just as a worker started to walk inside, he had to duck from more gunfire that barely missed him.</p>
      <p>The owner of the pizzeria, tired of all the violence outside his store, said he has been trying to sell it for weeks.</p>
