      <p>The summit is aimed at fleshing out details of the implementation of the landmark Paris Agreement climate pact, amid calls for urgent action from environmental groups and climate protesters.</p>
      <p>The Spanish government said in a statement earlier on Thursday that Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez was ready to do what was needed to host the summit in Madrid.</p>
      <p>A formal decision on hosting the summit in Madrid will be taken on Monday, the source said on Thursday.</p>
      <p>“It is nearly done, we have every chance of getting it,” the source said.</p>
      <p>Chilean President Sebastian Pinera said Sanchez had offered to host the summit in Spain on the same days as previously scheduled, between Dec. 2 and Dec. 13.</p>
      <p>“I hope that this generous offer from the president of Spain... represents a solution,” Pinera said. “We have shared this information with the leading authorities at the United Nations.”</p>
      <p>The so-called Conference of the Parties (COP) is the formal meeting of parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).</p>
      <p>A spokesman earlier on Thursday said the UNFCCC was waiting to receive an official letter from Spain offering to host the talks and would then organize a meeting to assess the offer.</p>
      <p>Chile’s withdrawal is the first time that a nation has pulled out of hosting the conference with just a month to go.</p>
      <p>Violent riots in recent days have left large parts of capital Santiago shut down, with its vital metro transport system suffering nearly $400 million in damage.</p>
