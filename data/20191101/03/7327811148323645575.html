      <p>LOWER MANHATTAN (WABC) -- The streets of New York City were filled with costumed characters for Halloween.</p>
      <p>Tens of thousands of revelers marched Thursday night in the 46th annual Village Halloween Parade.</p>
      <p>The mile and a half parade kicked off at Spring Street and proceeded up Sixth Avenue to West 15th Street.</p>
      <p>While people geared up for the parade in Lower Manhattan, the police launched their own operation to keep crowds safe.</p>
      <p>The NYPD says they are operating with heightened vigilance due to recent world events.</p>
      <p>While everyone was decked out in their "wild things" themed costumes at the Village Halloween parade, the NYPD planned a highly visible presence of their officers along with blocker trucks and K9 explosive teams.</p>
      <p>The holidays can be targets, and Halloween marks two years since the West Side Highway attacks that killed eight people.</p>
      <p>It has also been just days since the death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of ISIS, causing concern.</p>
      <p>The NYPD focused on security so that the thousands attending the parade were able to focus on the parade festivities.</p>
      <p>"The Wild Thing-themed puppets, there are 50 of them. Outside of that we have Day of the Dead puppets, we have different classifications, I think all together 150 puppets," said Grace Schultz, Volunteer Coordinator for the Village Halloween Parade.</p>
      <p>The parade, which is open to anyone wearing a costume, began in 1973 with a puppeteer marching with his family and grew into a televised extravaganza.</p>
