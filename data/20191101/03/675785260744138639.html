      <h1>Love Island's X Factor stars needed therapy to work through their trust issues</h1>
      <h2>The group have been participating in numerous bonding exercises including being blindfolded and made to fall backwards</h2>

      <p>You would have thought all that time in the Love Island villa might have brought the Celebrity <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/x-factor">X Factor</a> group No Love Lost closer together.</p>
      <p>Apparently not. Mentor <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/simon-cowell">Simon Cowell</a> has sent <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/who-wes-nelson-everything-you-12611484">Wes Nelson</a> , <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/who-love-islands-zara-mcdermott-12724738">Zara McDermott</a> , <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/who-samira-mighty-love-island-12611246">Samira Mighty</a> and Eyal Booker to therapy to work on their “trust issues” with each other.</p>
      <p>“Simon called in professional therapists,” explains an insider.</p>
      <p>“There are a few problems behind the scenes which need to be ironed out, and so the pros were involved who could address these issues and make them more of a unit.”</p>
      <p>One bonding exercise involved the All or Nothing singers being blindfolded, falling backwards and trusting the others to catch them. But model and influencer Eyal, 24, denied a rift.</p>

      <p>He revealed: “Despite us spending 16 hours together a day and writing our own tracks in the studio until after midnight, the show got us doing some bonding exercises.</p>
      <p>“We found the whole thing hilarious. We didn’t think we could get any closer – but it goes to show we are the strongest we’ve ever been as a band.”</p>

      <p>They need as much help as they can get. Bookmakers Coral have revealed No Love Lost are 2-1 to be given the chop.</p>
      <p>Interviewer Martin Bashir is facing worse odds of 1-2, while TOWIE star Megan McKenna has odds of 50-1 she will be next to leave the ITV show.</p>
      <p>Perhaps those falling exercises will help prepare the Love Islanders if they do crash out on Saturday.</p>
