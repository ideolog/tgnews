      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/yungblud">Yungblud</a> – aka Dominic Harrison – has unveiled a chilling new music video for ‘Die A Little’, his contribution to the soundtrack of the third season of <a href="https://www.nme.com/tag/netflix">Netflix</a>’s teen drama <i>13 Reasons Why</i>.</p>

      <p>The clip, according to Yungblud in a press release, is a “call out to take mental health seriously”. It was shot in Bulgaria and directed by Andrew Sandler, who previously worked on the singer’s ‘<a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/yungblud-announces-new-ep-unveils-stirring-video-hope-underrated-youth-2551030">Hope For The Underrated Youth’ visual</a>, the lead single from his latest EP of the same name.

      <p>In a statement, Yungblud explained that ‘Die A Little’ is “about realising and accepting the dark part of your mind that is trying to get out.” He added, “People who don’t understand what you are going through will try to interfere and generalise what you’re feeling. That can end up with them getting as hurt as you.”</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/yungblud-13-reasons-interview-defence-mental-health-depression-2533257">Yungblud came to the defence of <i>13 Reasons Why</i></a>, arguing that the controversial show helps raise awareness around the difficulty of talking about mental health. “I think it’s really important,” Yungblud told <i>NME</i>.</p>
      <p>“There’s so much controversy around this show because people think it’s glamorising anxiety. I do not. It’s doing what good art should do: it’s highlighting a subject that people wouldn’t normally talk about,” he added. The Netflix show was <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/tv/13-reasons-why-renewed-final-season-2534577">recently renewed for a fourth and final season</a>.</p>
      <p>In October, Yungblud returned with a new EP, ‘The Underrated Youth’. The six-track record is “sharply written and filled with bold, unapologetic political statements”, <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/yungblud-underrated-youth-ep-review"><i>NME</i>‘s Hannah Mylrea wrote in a four-star review</a>.</p>
