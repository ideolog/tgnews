      <h2>WARNING GRAPHIC IMAGES: Doctors had to cut decomposing tissue out of Angela Pedrosa's bum after the procedure</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T03:45:36+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 03:45</time> by <a rel="author">Matthew Dresch, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matthew-dresch/</a></address>
      <p>A mum was left with holes in her bum after a butt lift went horrifically wrong in Brazil.</p>
      <p>Angela Pedrosa, 26, has huge scars on her bottom as a result of the procedure, which allegedly involved 300 millilitres of silicone being injected into her rear.</p>
      <p>The mother-of-three suffered an infection after the treatment and doctors had to cut out rotten tissue from her bum.</p>
      <p>She stayed in a Rio de Janeiro hospital for more than two months and will require a second risky butt lift to repair her bottom.</p>

      <p>The new butt lift will transfer fat from her tummy to her bum, although it cannot go ahead until her recovery is complete, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7636735/Woman-26-needs-rear-reconstructed.html">Mail Online</a> reports.</p>
      <p>She is currently living in constant pain and her confidence has been shattered by the ordeal.</p>
      <p>Her experience comes after Sophie Elise, 24, spoke out about her regret at having a bum lift when she was 19.</p>
      <p>Ms Elise claims she did not even have a consultation and now wants to have the operation reversed.</p>

      <p>The YouTuber, from Oslo, Norway, had the surgery in Turkey, where bum lifts are available at rock-bottom prices.</p>
      <p>Ms Elise, who has 400,000 followers on  <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> , now plans to fly to Los Angeles for an operation to restore her natural buttocks.</p>
      <p>Writing on her  <a href="https://sophieelise.blogg.no/">blog</a> , she said: "I’m tired of having an a** which doesn’t look natural.</p>
      <p>"I didn't think about consistency and what I'd want to look like at 50-years-old.</p>

      <p>"Now that I'm older, I think in a completely different way and the choices I make, whether physical or mental, should be ones I can live with forever."</p>
      <p>She warned that cheap plastic surgery came with consequences and was 'not durable',  <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/10180418/woman-blogger-sophie-elise-reduce-size-bum-cheap-unnatural-butt-lift-turkey/">The Sun</a>  reports.</p>
      <p>Ms Elise, who recently had a breast reduction, blamed herself for 'dragging' her fans into the reversal process and vowed to keep future operations private.</p>
