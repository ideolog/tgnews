      <p>According to SAPOL:</p>
      <blockquote>At 9pm on Thursday 31 October a man entered the Grand Junction Road restaurant with what appeared to be an imitation firearm, assaulted the teenaged staff member and stole cash from the till.  Fortunately, there were no injuries.<br/><br/>He was last seen running through the rear carpark onto Hotham Street and is believed to have left in a small white hatchback, possibly a Toyota SUV or similar, that was parked in Leeds Avenue.<br/><br/>The suspect is described as 170-175cm tall with a skinny build and pale complexion. He was wearing a dark hooded top, dark chino pants and a joker-style clown mask.<br/><br/>Anyone with information on the robbery is asked to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or online at <a href="https://crimestopperssa.com.au/">www.crimestopperssa.com.au</a></blockquote>
