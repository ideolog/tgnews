      <p>GLENDALE, Ariz. — Jimmy Garoppolo threw for 317 yards and four touchdowns and the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/san-francisco-49ers">San Francisco 49ers</a> reached the halfway point of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl">their season</a> undefeated, beating the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/arizona-cardinals">Arizona Cardinals</a> 28-25 on Thursday night.</p>
      <p>San Francisco (8-0) fell behind 7-0, but responded with three touchdowns — one as time expired in the second quarter after Cardinals coach Kliff Kingsbury called a timeout and gave the 49ers a second chance on fourth down — to take a 21-7 halftime lead.</p>

      <p>The 49ers were in control until about five minutes left in the fourth quarter, when Andy Isabella caught a short pass and sprinted for an 88-yard touchdown to help the Cardinals pull to 28-25.</p>
      <p>But the 49ers were able to run out the clock on their ensuing offensive drive to end Arizona's comeback. San Francisco's Emmanuel Sanders caught seven passes for 112 yards and a touchdown.</p>
      <p>Arizona (3-5-1) lost its second straight game. Rookie quarterback Kyler Murray threw for 241 yards and two touchdowns.</p>

      <p>The Cardinals came into the game without their top two running backs, David Johnson and Chase Edmonds, who were battling injuries.</p>
      <p>Kenyan Drake — who was acquired by the Cardinals on Monday in a trade with the Miami Dolphins — ran for 36 yards on the first play of the game and capped the opening drive with a 4-yard touchdown run. He finished with a team-high 110 yards rushing and 52 yards receiving.</p>
