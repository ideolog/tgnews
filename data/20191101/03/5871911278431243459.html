      <p>WWE champion Brock Lesnar and Cain Velasquez went one on one in the ring on October 31 for the WWE Championship at <i>Crown Jewel</i> in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.</p>
      <p>This would be the first time both men would face off against each other in nine years since their big fight at <i>UFC 121</i> back in 2010 when Cain defeated Lesnar.</p>

      <p>Valasquez had a great showing in the early goings of the match by delivering some heavy blows and knees to The Beast.</p>
      <p>Both men would deliver a UFC style match. Cain would knock Brock down but it would be the champ that would catch Cain with the Kamura Lock for Cain to tap out.</p>
      <p>Brock would ultimately claim his vengeance for his loss against Velasquez at <i>UFC 121</i> and retain the WWE Championship.</p>

      <p>After the match, Brock would attack Cain with a steel chair to the back repeatedly.</p>
      <p>Rey Mysterio, who accompanied Velasquez to the ring, received chair shots of his own from Brock.</p>
