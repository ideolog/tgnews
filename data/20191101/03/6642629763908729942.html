      <p>Nepali<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/02/kp-sharma-oli-appointed-nepal-prime-minister-180215113017547.html"> Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli</a> was discharged from a private hospital in Kathmandu late on Thursday after being hospitalised the previous day - raising concerns about his health and <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/nepal.html">Nepal</a>'s future.</p>
      <p>Oli, 66, was rushed to Grande Hospital in the country's capital on Wednesday, with his spokesmen saying it was a "routine checkup," but local media have reported that he underwent dialysis for his kidney.</p>
      <p>The leader of <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/nepal.html">Nepal</a> was admitted to the intensive care unit of the hospital, where he underwent dialysis for renal disease, according to Kantipur, Nepal's national newspaper.</p>
      <p>The Himalyan Times also reported that the prime minister underwent a second dialysis on Thursday after undergoing the same treatment on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>In August, Oli travelled twice to Singapore, where doctors removed excess antibodies which can reject a transplanted kidney according to doctors.</p>
      <p>Oli, chairman of the ruling Nepal Communist Party, underwent a kidney transplant 12 years ago in India. Since then, he has frequently travelled to India, Thailand and Singapore for follow-up treatments.</p>
