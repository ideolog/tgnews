      <p>SHANGHAI (Nov 1): Asian shares reversed early losses on Friday as an unexpected bounce in Chinese manufacturing activity offset some negativity cast by a <i>Bloomberg </i>news report that raised doubts over whether the United States and China can reach a long-term trade deal.</p>
      <p>Factory activity in China expanded at its fastest pace in more than two years in October as export orders and production rose, a private business survey showed on Friday.</p>
      <p>The expansion, which beat expectations and contrasted with the dour results of an official survey Thursday, helped to boost Chinese blue chips, which rose 0.7%.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong's Hang Seng added 0.3% and Seoul's Kospi rose 0.42%.</p>
      <p>MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan reversed early losses to add 0.16%, having hit three-month highs on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The index's performance reflected a results season that has shown companies to be more resilient than expected, said Jim McCafferty, head of Equity Research, Asia ex-Japan at Nomura.</p>
      <p>"If you look at the micro data supplied by the companies, then it tells you that customers ... are continuing to do business. So I think that we are in a better state than perhaps investors thought we were just one month ago," he said.</p>
      <p>Earlier on Friday, losses had mirrored falls in global stock markets, as MSCI's gauge of equity performance in 47 countries fell from 20-month highs after a report that cast doubt on the likelihood of a US-China trade deal.</p>
      <p>On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.52%, the S&amp;P 500 lost 0.30% and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.14%.</p>
      <p>Efforts by Washington and Beijing to end their bruising nearly 16-month trade war appeared on track as US President Donald Trump said on Thursday said that the two sides would soon announce a new venue for the signing of a "Phase One" trade deal after Chile cancelled a planned summit set for mid-November.</p>
      <p>Optimism was dampened by a <i>Bloomberg </i>report citing unnamed Chinese officials airing doubts over whether a comprehensive long-term trade deal is possible.</p>
      <p>China's doubts were "not entirely unexpected", Greg McKenna, strategist at McKenna Macro, said in a morning note to clients, noting that the falls in equity markets were relatively small.</p>
      <p>Retreats in the S&amp;P 500 and the US 10-year Treasury yield indicated some technical resistance in the market, he said.</p>
      <p>"Either way, today's deluge of manufacturing PMI's and then US non-farm (payrolls) tonight will be an important factor in where markets head next," McKenna said.</p>
      <p>The Institute for Supply Management is due to release data from its survey of purchasing managers on Friday. A separate PMI survey released Thursday by the Chicago Fed showed a sharper contraction in midwestern manufacturing activity for October.</p>
      <p>The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes was higher at 1.6962% compared with its US close of 1.691% on Thursday. The two-year yield, sensitive to market expectations of Federal Reserve policy, was at 1.5319%, up from a US close of 1.526%.</p>
      <p>The Fed cut interest rates for a third time this year on Wednesday to help sustain US growth, but signalled there would be no further reductions unless the economy takes a turn for the worse.</p>
      <p>In the currency market, the US dollar was a touch stronger than the safe-haven yen, adding 0.01% to 108.03.</p>
      <p>The euro was 0.14% higher on the day at US$1.1166, while the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was down 0.14% at 97.216 on the day.</p>
      <p>US crude ticked up 0.33% to US$54.36 a barrel and Brent crude rose 0.13% to US$59.70 per barrel.</p>
      <p>Spot gold eased 0.15% to US$1,510.94 per ounce.</p>
