      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/most-mandatory-evacuations-lifted-for-los-angeles-getty-fire-fire-officials">Meteorologists</a> on Thursday said there’s little chance that<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/homeless-encampment-easy-fire-california-arson-inspector"> Los Angeles</a> sees any rain in the next few weeks, while the city—which hasn’t seen significant rain in months-- remains on edge over the threat of fires.</p>
      <p>“Luckily, we are not seeing any more Santa  Ana winds within the next week,” a meteorologist told the Los Angeles Times.  The paper reported that the critical fire weather warnings has extended through Friday.</p>
      <p>"Don't let your guard down... be prepared," Ryan Kittell, National Weather Service meteorologist.</p>
      <p>Southern California Edison said its safety power cuts still affected about 215,000 people by late Wednesday night and warned that outages were under consideration for about 800,000 people.</p>
      <p>The days of windstorms are not unusual for the fall season, which has seen vicious gusts propel a series of deadly and destructive California wildfires in recent years.</p>
      <p>But at least in the short term, there was good news from forecasters.</p>

      <p>“This is the last event in our near future. We are not expecting any Santa Anas next week,” weather service meteorologist Kristen Stewart said.</p>
