      <h1>Zion Williamson smacks teammate Jaxson Hayes in face while celebrating (Video)</h1>

      <p>Pelicans big man Zion Williamson is quite a large fellow, so when he swings his body around, it’s best to just get out of his way.</p>
      <p>Even teammates are in danger, as Jaxson Hayes learned during Thursday’s game against the Nuggets.</p>
      <p>Williamson was fired up after the Pelicans came up with a big play in the second half of the game — en route to a 115-98 win — and he reacted as such.</p>
      <p>The problem was that Hayes was a bit too close to him, and Williamson ended up smacking him right in the face.</p>
