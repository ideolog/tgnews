      <h1>Harry Dunn's family call on police chief to resign over 'sad' tweet</h1>
      <h2>Anne Sacoolas, the wife of an American spy, was allegedly driving on the wrong side of the road when Harry Dunn was killed in a crash outside RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T03:17:30+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 03:17</time> by <a rel="author">Louie Smith, https://www.facebook.com/dailymirror/</a></address>
      <p>The family of tragic teenager Harry Dunn have called for the chief constable involved to resign.</p>
      <p>Nick Adderley, of Northants Police, has been blasted for a tweet he posted following the death of the 19-year-old in an accident with Anne Sacoolas, 42.</p>
      <p>Reacting to news the Dunn family was launching legal action in America, Mr Adderley wrote on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> : “How sad but how predictable.”</p>
      <p>He later deleted it and claimed it was “in reference to the profound sadness and loss of Harry Dunn”.</p>

      <p>But a family spokesman said: “Mr Adderley displayed a staggering degree of unprofessionalism with this tweet, such that he no longer commands the confidence of the family.</p>
      <p>“[The family] feel Mr Adderley should now do the honourable thing and resign.”</p>
      <p>Experienced motorcyclist Harry was involved in a road accident with Ms Sacoolas outside RAF Croughton on August 27. Her husband Jonathan works at Croughton, which is being used by the US as an intelligence base.</p>

      <p>The mum-of-three initially cooperated with police, but later fled the UK citing diplomatic immunity.</p>
      <p>British detectives have travelled to the US to interview Ms Sacoolas. Her account has been passed to the CPS.</p>
      <p>Harry’s parents ­Charlotte Charles, 44, and Tim Dunn, 50, are now preparing to launch a judicial review of the Foreign Office’s handling of the case. They also intend to sue Ms Sacoolas and the Trump administration.</p>
