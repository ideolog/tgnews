      <h1>Jeffrey Wright Compares President Trump to Charles Manson</h1>
      <h2>Left-wing actor Jeffrey Wright compared President Donald Trump to notorious cult leader Charles Manson in an impeachment-related social media post.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T03:33:15+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 03:33</time> by <a rel="author">Jerome Hudson</a></address>
      <p>Wright’s tweet features a video of Devin Nunes (R-CA) delivering a speech on the House floor, defending President Donald Trump against the Democrats’ ongoing push for impeachment.</p>
      <p>“What we’re seeing among Democrats on the Intelligence Committee down in the SCIF right now is like a cult,” Nunes is seen saying in a video attached to Wright’s tweet. “These are a group of people loyally following their leader as he bounces from one outlandish conspiracy theory to another. And the media are the cult followers.”</p>
      <p>Captioning his tweet, Jeffrey Wright said “Happy Halloween, I guess, folks.” The <i>Westworld </i>actor’s tweet also features short video with President Trump making facial gestures on the left and Manson making similar facial expressions on the right.</p>

      <p>Wright seemingly spent hours on Thursday heckling the president. He was among the many Hollywood leftists who took to social media and celebrated after the House <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/10/31/house-democrats-passes-partisan-impeachment-process-resolution/">passed</a> H. Res. 660 on a partisan vote of 232-196 — a bill that allows House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-CA) caucus to formally establish the rules regarding the ongoing impeachment inquiry Democrats are pursing against President Donald Trump.</p>
      <p>“*I’m November 6, 2018, and I approve this message.* Democracy, baby. VOTE,” Jeffrey Wright <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2019/10/31/hollywood-celebrates-impeachment-vote-lets-get-on-with-it-shall-we/">said</a> mere minutes after the bill passed.</p>
      <p>Just last month the <i>No Time to Die</i> actor<i> </i><a href="https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2019/09/30/jeffrey-wright-impeachment-this-corrupt-lowlife-clown/">called</a> Trump a “corrupt lowlife clown” who needs to be impeached.</p>
