      <p>France Bleu reported that the shooter was at large.</p>
      <p>While those injured were hospitalized, the authorities blocked off the area near the bar.</p>
      <p>The police launched a probe into the incident. They consider score-settling as one of the reasons behind the shooting.</p>
      <p>Xavier Tarabeux, the public prosecutor of Marseille, told France Bleu that back in 2017, a 26-year-old man was killed in a score-settling incident at the same bar.</p>
