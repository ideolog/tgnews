      <p>A dealer said risk appetite in the market was sour as worries over the US-China trade resurfaced, with China doubtful that it could have a long-term trade deal with Washington.</p>

      <p>However, Maybank and IHH were flat at RM8.60 and RM5.70 respectively.</p>
      <p>Of the actives, Sumatec, Multi Sports and Priceworth were flat at half-a-sen, 1.5 sen and five sen respectively, while Bumi Armada added one sen to 46 sen.</p>
      <p>The FBM Emas Index was 30.54 points weaker at 11,275.19, the FBMT 100 Index fell 32.71 points to 11,083.37, and the FBM Emas Shariah Index shed 5.83 points to 11,823.95.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the FBM Ace advanced 10.34 points to 4,983.45 and the FBM 70 gained 4.7 points to 13,954.96.</p>
      <p>Sector-wise, the Financial Services Index gave up 89.65 points for 15,567.3, the Industrial Products &amp; Services Index inched down 0.69 point to 152.82, but the Plantation Index earned 5.15 points to 6,741.24. — Bernama</p>
