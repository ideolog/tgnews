      <h1>AC Milan breathe easier after seeing off lowly SPAL in Serie A</h1>

      <p>MILAN: <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/AC-Milan">AC Milan</a> avoided a Halloween scare by beating <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Serie-A">Serie A</a> strugglers <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/SPAL">SPAL</a> 1-0 at the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/San-Siro">San Siro</a> on Thursday to give coach Stefano Pioli his first win since replacing the sacked Marco Giampaolo.</p>
      <p>The victory lifted Milan into the top 10 with 13 points from 10 games while Ferrara-based SPAL, who have only beaten Milan once away from home, remained second-bottom with seven.</p>
      <p>After a first half short on incident, winger Suso came off the bench in the 57th and scored six minutes later with a curling free kick into the top corner from the edge of the area after Krzysztof Piatek was brought down.</p>
      <p>The strike ended a goal drought dating back to May for the Spaniard, who has drawn the ire of fans after a poor start to the season.</p>
      <p>Milan defender Theo Hernandez had earlier netted off a pass from Lucas Paqueta two minutes after the break but it was ruled offside, while winger Samu Castillejo hit the bar from close range in the 13th.</p>
      <p>Paqueta came close in the 79th when he was thwarted at close range by SPAL's Albania goalkeeper Etrit Berisha.</p>
      <p>Pioli had collected only one point from his first two games after replacing Giampaolo on Oct. 9 and he made four changes from the side that lost 2-1 to AS Roma at the Stadio Olimpico on Sunday.</p>
      <p>"I'm happy for the players, for the fans and for the club," Pioli told Sky Italia.</p>
      <p>"I asked the team to show spirit and they did... We gave little away. It's a shame we kept the result in the balance until the end. Now we need to concentrate on the next game."</p>
      <p>Milan are at home to fifth-placed Lazio on Sunday.</p>
