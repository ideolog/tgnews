      <p>The Montreal mayor’s decision to postpone Halloween festivities due to heavy rain was not enough to dampen the spirits of some dedicated trick-or-treaters who donned their costumes and went out anyway.</p>
      <p>In Montreal West, children dressed as skeletons, princesses, and even a Rubik’s Cube were spotted trudging down soggy sidewalks to collect their candy on Thursday night.</p>

      <p>On Wednesday, Montreal Mayor <a href="https://twitter.com/Val_Plante/status/1189636140057407488">Valerie Plante ignited a firestorm when she asked residents</a> to celebrate the holiday on Friday instead because of the expected downpour and high winds.</p>
      <p>Following her announcement, the hashtag #halloweengate was trending on Twitter as critics took to the social media platform to express their displeasure with the decision.</p>
      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/MoffattAriane/status/1189922953003229190">Quebec pop star Ariane Moffatt joked</a> that the mayor was probably doing a rain dance in her office on Thursday, so she could justify her call.</p>
      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/DenisCoderre/status/1189858774342885377">And former Montreal Mayor Denis Coderre sarcastically asked</a> if Christmas would be postponed this year due to snow. <a href="https://twitter.com/DenisCoderre/status/1189873969610022912">He also suggested</a> Plante was behaving like a “sheep” because she was following the lead of other communities that rescheduled the traditional Halloween night trick-or-treating in light of the weather forecast.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, at least six other municipalities in Quebec announced they were postponing the festivities until Friday.</p>
      <p>The barrage of online criticism prompted Plante to <a href="https://twitter.com/Val_Plante/status/1189928304540880897">defend herself with a simple Tweet</a> in French that translates as “Damn(ed) if you do, and damn(ed) if you don’t.”</p>
      <p>While some brave trick-or-treaters in Montreal have already made their rounds, police reminded those heading out on Friday evening to take precautions and stay safe out on the streets.</p>
