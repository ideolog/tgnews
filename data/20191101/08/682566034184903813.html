      <p>Austin - <b>Max Verstappen</b> on Thursday hit back at his critics, including <b>Lewis Hamilton</b> and <b>Sebastian Vettel</b>, saying their post-race comments in Mexico last Sunday proved that he was "in their heads".</p>
      <p>The Red Bull driver told reporters at a news briefing at the Circuit of the Americas ahead of this weekend United States Grand Prix that Mercedes' Hamilton had been "silly" and "disrespectful" in what he had said.</p>
      <p>Hamilton, who is set to win his sixth drivers' world championship this weekend, had answered questions about the Dutchman's on-track aggression by saying he treated him differently to other rivals and gave him extra room.</p>
      <p>The pair had clashed on the opening lap of the Mexican Grand Prix and while Hamilton recovered to win the race, Verstappen went on to collect a puncture in a failed attempt to pass Valtteri Bottas, in the second Mercedes before pitting.</p>
      <p>He finished sixth after a thrilling drive through the field.</p>
      <p>Verstappen objected, he said, to Hamilton saying he had been "torpedoed" by him.</p>
      <p>"Looking at Turns One and Two in Mexico, I don't think that happened," he said.</p>
      <p>"I think, from my side, it is a bit of a silly comment to make because I think I always race hard, but fair, and I think it is just not correct.</p>
      <p>"Of course, it's easy to have a dig at someone, but from my side, it's fine. It's always positive when someone talks about you because it means you are in their head."</p>
      <p>He added: "I think that from my side, it shows already that I'm in their heads and I guess that's a good thing.</p>
      <p>"I don't need to dig into other people in a press conference because first of all I think it's a bit disrespectful as well - I prefer to fight on track, which I love to do.</p>
      <p>"And, of course, I like to fight hard, but on the edge, otherwise - if they want me to stay behind - it's better just to stay at home."</p>
      <p>"I really want to take the fight to them because that's what we are here for - we are racers, we are in F1. I think we are the best out there and, yeah, we do fight for victories because that's what I live for."</p>
      <p>Hamilton's comments on giving extra space on track for Verstappen were supported by Vettel. "Yes and yes, copy and paste!" he said. "It's true."</p>
      <p>Verstappen has slipped to fifth in the drivers' championship since the European summer break in August without adding to his two earlier wins in Austria and Germany.</p>
