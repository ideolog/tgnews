      <p>In a new interview with <a href="https://choice.npr.org/index.html?origin=https://www.npr.org/2019/10/29/774512342/megan-thee-stallion-at-tiny-desk-fest-i-m-always-trying-to-one-up-myself">NPR</a>, Megan spoke more about how plans for her debut were progressing and how her past personas – such as Hot Girl Meg and Tina Snow – have helped her to create a new persona called ‘Suga’.</p>
      <p>She said: “I felt like my mixtapes were me flirting with my fans…I never wanted to do an album ’cause I was like, ‘Oh, that feel like marriage. That’s a commitment.’ But now, I’m ready to settle down with an album.”</p>
      <p>Speaking about her new potential alter ego, Suga, Megan added: “She’s besties with Tina Snow…it’s a big problem.”</p>

      <p>Back in September, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/megan-thee-stallion-confirms-kehlani-collaboration-2549058">Megan also revealed that her forthcoming album would include a collaboration with Kehlani.</a></p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://variety.com/2019/music/news/megan-thee-stallion-kehlani-music-1203337271/">Variety</a>, the rapper was initially hesitant to speak out when asked about potential guests on the record.</p>
      <p>“Yeah, I’m working on a new project and I have a lot of ladies on there, so just be on the lookout,” she told reporters. After some prompting on who those ladies might be, Megan added: “I can let this cat of the bag. Me and Kehlani have music together, and I love her.”</p>
      <p>Recently, Megan Thee Stallion <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/megan-thee-stallion-premieres-horror-series-hottieween-youtube-2562501">also premiered <i>Hottieween</i>, a multi-episode horror series on YouTube directed by Teyana Taylor.</a></p>
      <p>The Houston rapper had revealed in a recent interview that she was <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/megan-thee-stallion-is-creating-her-own-horror-movie-and-loves-the-human-centipede-2560476">working on a horror movie.</a> On Tuesday (October 29), she released the first episode of <i>Hottieween</i>, titled ‘Love Bites’; the episode also marked her acting debut.</p>
      <p>Megan conceptualised the series, which was produced in collaboration with YouTube Music. She stars in <i>Hottieween</i> as a private investigator in her hometown of Stallion County opposite the rapper Dave East and Jay Cole (who was the comedic protagonist of <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/megan-thee-stallion-nicki-minaj-ty-dolla-ign-pool-party-hot-girl-summer-video-2544671">Megan’s video for ‘Hot Girl Summer’</a>).</p>
      <p>“When a vicious group of Fuccbois take over town, Megan and her trusty sidekick Janine (Jay Cole) are on the case. A chance encounter with the mysterious Archimedes (Dave East) provides leads and a potentially undying relationship,” the first episode’s official description reads.</p>
