      <h2>The Duchess of Sussex comforted a crying domestic violence victim in London who had been stabbed by a former partner</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T08:02:17+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 08:02</time> by <a rel="author">Matthew Dresch, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matthew-dresch/</a></address>
      <p>Meghan Markle opened up about the 'hopes, fears and insecurities' as she chatted to disadvantaged women.</p>
      <p>The Duchess of Sussex comforted a crying domestic violence victim during a visit to the London-based Luminary Bakery, a non-profit organisation set up to empower women.</p>
      <p>She told the woman, who was stabbed by a former partner, that humans are 'not mechanical objects that need to be fixed'.</p>
      <p>Meghan also spoke out about women having a 'deep connection' and 'shared understanding' with each other in her latest interview.</p>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/royal-family/2019/10/31/behind-scenes-meghan-markle-duchess-tells-bryony-gordon-vulnerability/">Daily Telegraph</a>, the royal said: "I find that when you strip all the layers away, as people, and especially as women, we can find deep connection with each other, and a shared understanding.</p>

      <p>"Our lives may be different, our backgrounds, our experiences, all varied, but I find that in these moments of connection it becomes abundantly clear that our hopes, our fears, our insecurities, the things that make us tickâ€¦. well, those are very much the same. And there's comfort in that."</p>
      <p>She also criticised today's 'culture of instant gratification, or the instant fix' during her visit to the bakery.</p>
      <p>Megan told the Daily Telegraph she did not want people to love her - and instead hopes they will to listen to her.</p>
      <p>It comes after the Duchess revealed she was struggling being a mum in the spotlight.</p>

      <p>Meghan and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/prince-harry">Prince Harry</a> gave in-depth interviews in a recent ITV documentary that charted their Africa Royal Tour.</p>
      <p>Prince Harry also revealed he and brother William were going down separate paths in life.</p>
      <p>The Duchess, who appeared emotional on screen, said pregnancy is a "really vulnerable" time, adding not many people had asked after her well being.</p>
      <p>She said she had "tried to adopt this British sensibility of a stiff upper lip" but had been left feeling hurt over negative press coverage the couple had received.</p>
