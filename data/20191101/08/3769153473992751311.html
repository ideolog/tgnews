      <blockquote>Hi Everyone,<br/><br/>I'm super happy to announce the release of my new course, "<a href="https://blendermarket.com/products/the-art-of-effective-rigging-in-blender?ref=2">The art of effective rigging in Blender</a>".<br/><br/>It's a 100% Blender rigging course that will fit both beginners and more advanced riggers. I've put a lot of energy in this course and took the time to edit it as well as I could with the help of Tom Murphy and Fin O'Riordan. I will run a <b>special offer until Sunday the 3rd</b> with the course at only 35$ instead of 49$.<br/><br/>If you want to know more about the course, just check out the announcement video right here.<br/>You will find all the links to buy the course in the video description.<br/><br/>Hope you will like it.</blockquote>
