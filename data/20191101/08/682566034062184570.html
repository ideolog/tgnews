      <p>Cape Town - Former <b>SuperSport</b> soccer and sports broadcaster <b>Robert Marawa</b> on Thursday launched a weekly <b>YouTube</b> sports show: <b>Thursday Night Live on Marawa TV</b>.</p>
      <p>Marawa was acrimoniously dumped by the SuperSport on May 16, from his weekly "Thursday Night Live with Robert Marawa' show. With the pundit saying the sports channel told him less than two hours before the scheduled recording of his show via SMS not to show up for work.</p>
      <p>The sportscaster intimated that his effective axing by SuperSport was due to the disclosures he made about sexual harassment within the organisation.</p>
      <p>Which led to a public spat between the two parties that caused a great deal of controversy and indignation among the popular Marawa's many followers.</p>
      <p>Since then, Marawa launched his own YouTube channel when covering the 2019 AFCON in Egypt that has now resulted in the introduction of his new weekly show.</p>
      <p>Guests included former Orlando Pirates goalkeeper Brilliant Khuzwayo, Kaizer Chiefs attacker Lebogang Manyama and former rugby player Kennedy Tsimba.</p>
      <p>At the time of writing, the first episode has just under 9000 views with Marawa's YouTube channel boasting over 31 000 subscribers.</p>
