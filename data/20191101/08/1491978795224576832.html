        <i>Collection to go on display at Holocaust museum – but art historian says pieces either forgeries or modified with Nazi symbols later</i>
      </p>
      <p>Journalists from around the world congregated at Argentina’s Holocaust museum for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/03/nazi-artefacts-hoard-argentina-holocaust-museum">a special viewing of a hoard of Nazi artefacts</a> including a giant silver eagle, a Ouija board inscribed with Nazi symbols, and a swastika-emblazoned instrument for measuring skulls.</p>
      <p>The collection – discovered by police behind a false wall in the home of a Buenos Aires antiquarian – is due to go on display next month when the museum reopens after a $4.5m renovation.</p>
      <p>“It’s been proven that they are real from the time of the second world war,” said the president of the museum, Marcelo Mindlin, at the press preview last month.</p>
      <p>Mindlin speculated that the items may have been brought to Argentina by fugitive Nazis – a narrative that would fit perfectly with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/1998/nov/18/ukigoni">Argentina’s sad history as a bolthole for war criminals</a>, including Adolf Eichmann and Josef Mengele, who escaped to South America after the fall of the Third Reich.</p>
      <p>News of the haul was reported by newspapers around the world, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/03/nazi-artefacts-hoard-argentina-holocaust-museum">including the Guardian</a>.</p>
      <p>But the historical value of the articles has been called into question by the German art historian invited to assess them for the Argentinian authorities.</p>
      <p>Stephen Klingen, from Munich’s <a href="https://www.zikg.eu/">Central Institute for Art History</a>, concluded that the 83 objects on display are either outright fakes or original pieces from the 1930s which had swastikas and other Nazi symbols added later.</p>
      <p>“You can display the objects as counterfeits, but you can not learn anything about the Nazi era from them,” Klingen told the Guardian in an email.</p>
      <p>Despite his findings, the Museo del Holocausto plans to go ahead with the display of a selected number of the items, arguing that they still have educational value.</p>
      <p>“They are original objects – original from the period – even if they were modified later,” said Jonathan Krszenbaum, director of the museum. “The skull-measuring instrument, even if the swastika was added later, is still from the Nazi period, or from the pre-Nazi period, and as such it has educational value because it exemplifies<br/>the Nazi obsession with the question of race.”</p>
      <p>He added: “They are not forgeries – they are originals which were adulterated later. That doesn’t reduce their historical significance.”</p>
      <p>Klingen said he was shocked by the Argentinian authorities’ handling of the objects: federal police chief Néstor Roncaglia and security minister Patricia Bullrich – who participated in the museum press conference on 2 October – received a report from him last year stating unequivocally they were almost all forgeries.</p>
      <p>The eight-page report was accompanied by a 280-page addendum describing how he reached his conclusions for each piece.</p>
      <p>The skull-measuring device was actually manufactured between 1890 and 1910, the report states, and has no association with the Nazi period. A plaque attached to its case reading “Amt für Rassenpolitk” (“Office for Racial Politics”) is fake – and no Nazi office existed under that name, Klingen said.</p>
      <p>Klingen said that only a handful of historically insignificant objects might be genuine, including three toolboxes from a Mauser munitions factory, part of a grenade launcher, a sundial with a swastika, a Nazi-era newsreel and various Hitler busts.</p>
      <p>“But because we were not allowed to do material investigations, even their authenticity could not be checked conclusively,” he said.</p>
      <p>The objects were found at the home of a Buenos Aires antiquarian Carlos Olivares during an unrelated investigation, and were handed to the museum for safe-keeping. Olivares is currently awaiting trial for allegedly bribing customs officials to smuggle antiques into <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/argentina">Argentina</a> from Asia and Africa.</p>
      <p>Asked if he considered that any of the artefacts were of sufficient historical significance to to be displayed at a museum about the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/holocaust">Holocaust</a>, Klingen replied: “No, absolutely not.”</p>
