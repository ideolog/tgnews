      <h1>Hamilton Rugby Club march on to National League Cup quarter-final</h1>
      <h2>Bulls will face GHK at home in January.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T08:00:00+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author">Andy McGilvray, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/andy-mcgilvray/</a></address>
      <p>Hamilton Rugby Club progressed in the National League Cup, but were made to work hard for their 48-24 first round win at Kirkcaldy.</p>
      <p>That sets up a quarter-final clash against fellow Tennent’s National League 2 side GHK at Laigh Bent on Saturday, January 25.</p>
      <p>With a league game against Kirkcaldy looming in a couple of weeks, this gives Hamilton an idea of what to expect.</p>
      <p>The Fifers, playing to their strength in the pack, got their first try in just three minutes through Chris Mann, having caught the Bulls defence off guard from kick-off.</p>
      <p>However, Hamilton steadied and quickly got back into the game, playing some good, controlled rugby.</p>
      <p>Mann was yellow-carded and Hamilton chose to scrum the penalty, from which they released Ross Jamieson in space out wide to scamper in for Hamilton’s first try, levelling the scores at 5-5 in 18 minutes.</p>
      <p>Discipline was key and it took another eight minutes for Hamilton to take the lead through good link-up play, sending Adam Ryan in under the posts to allow Owen McLeish an easy conversion on his 200th cap.</p>
      <p>In this see-saw period of the match it was Kirkcaldy who notched an equalising try, with several phases of forward drives leading to a try for Josh Laird and an easy conversion.</p>
      <p>That again spurred Hamilton into action and in 36 minutes, number 8 Scott Alexander barrelled over out wide to edge his side in front.</p>
      <p>As half-time approached, Hamilton stole lineout balls and Max Crumlish forced his way over close to the posts for a try which was converted by McLeish.</p>
      <p>Kirkcaldy responded straight from the kick-off, and some poor defending allowed them to cross out wide, reducing the half-time deficit to 24-17.</p>
      <p>Hamilton then took control in the second half with two quick tries.</p>
      <p>The first, from debutant winger Andrew Crawford, saw some crisp handling opening up space on the left for Crawford to dive over for an unconverted try.</p>
      <p>Two minutes later Ross Inglis took the ball at inside-centre and ran a great line to cut open the Kirkcaldy defence, leaving an easy conversion for McLeish for 36-17.</p>
      <p>Although Kirkcaldy countered with a try by Laird and conversion in 65 minutes, Hamilton were not to be denied and finished with a double for winger Ben Plant on 76 and 79 minutes, taking the score to 48-24.</p>
      <p>“This was a good win on the road, against a strong Kirkcaldy outfit,” said coach Kenny Brown.</p>
      <p>“We had a lot of young, inexperienced lads out there, and they all fronted up well.</p>
      <p>“We do have a couple of things to look at in defence, but I am delighted with the win.</p>
      <p>“We face them in the league in two weeks, so we know now how hard that match is going to be, and the lads are really up for it.”</p>
