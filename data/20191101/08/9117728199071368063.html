      <p><a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/lewis-hamilton">Lewis Hamilton</a> was the biggest name to openly criticize the <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/red-bull-racing">Red Bull</a> driver but others on the grid think this was unfair. </p>

      <p>Ricciardo likes the way his former teammate drives. <i>"I like Max and the way he races,"</i> he said to <i>Sky Sports</i>. <i>"I'd rather race against someone like him than someone who isn't as interested in defending or attacking hard."</i></p>

      <p>Bottas also believes that Verstappen is being wrongly attacked. <i>"I think it's a bit exaggerated,</i>" he told <i>SSN </i>at the Formula 1 demonstration in Hollywood. <i>“He has had very good races with great catch-up actions. Racing hard but fair. He's aggressive and that's great. Every driver behaves differently, but that's great because it would be boring if we were all the same."</i></p>
