        <b>An Indonesian man - who worked for an organisation that helped draft strict adultery laws - has been publicly whipped after being caught having an affair with a married woman.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Mukhlis bin Muhammad of the Aceh Ulema Council (MPU) was flogged 28 times.</p>
      <p>The woman he had the affair with was caned 23 times.</p>
      <p>Mukhlis is from the deeply conservative Aceh region, the only place in Indonesia which practises the strict Islamic law, Sharia.</p>
      <p>Gay sex and gambling are also punishable by public caning in Aceh.</p>
      <p>"This is God's law. Anyone must be flogged if proven guilty, even if he is a member of the MPU," Husaini Wahab, the deputy mayor of Aceh Besar district, where Mukhlis lives, told BBC News Indonesia.</p>
      <p>The couple were caught by officials in September, apparently in a car parked near a tourist beach.</p>
      <p>The caning happened on Thursday. Mr Husaini added that Mukhlis would be expelled from the MPU.</p>
      <p>The 46-year-old is also an Islamic religious leader. He is the first religious leader to be publicly caned in Aceh since Sharia law came into force in 2005.</p>
      <p>The MPU advises the local government and legislature on drafting and implementing Sharia law in Aceh.</p>

      <p>Aceh was granted special rights to introduce its own stricter Islamic laws more than a decade ago.</p>
      <p>Laws against homosexuality were passed in 2014 and came into effect the following year.</p>
      <p>Extra-marital sex, gambling, and the consumption, production and distribution of alcohol are all illegal under Sharia law.</p>
      <p>In 2017, two men were caned 83 times each in Aceh after they were caught having sex.</p>
      <p>Canes are typically made from rattan. Those carrying out the caning have all their body parts, except their eyes, covered to stop them from being identified.</p>
      <p>The caning must take place publicly on an open-air platform, though children are barred from watching.</p>
      <p>Sharia law applies to Muslims and non-Muslims alike in Aceh.</p>
