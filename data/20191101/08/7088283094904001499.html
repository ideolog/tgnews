        <b>British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has defended his Brexit deal with the EU, after US President Donald Trump warned it would make it impossible for the two nations to strike a future trade agreement.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The US leader, whose <a href="http://en.rfi.fr/americas/20191031-us-house-representatives-takes-first-vote-trump-impeachment">impeachment has moved a stage closer following a key vote in Congress</a>, waded into the British election campaign on Thursday to criticise Johnson's divorce terms with the European bloc.</p>
      <p>"This deal... you can't do it, you can't trade. We can't make a trade deal with the UK," he said.</p>
      <p>But a Downing Street spokesman said the deal would allow the UK to strike "our own free trade deals around the world from which every part of the UK will benefit".</p>

      <p><a href="http://en.rfi.fr/economy/20190825-france-sidelines-g7-summit-trump-backs-johnson-over-brexit-talks">Trump's comments appear at odds with his claim in September</a> that he was working closely with Johnson to strike a "magnificent trade deal" once Britain left the EU.</p>
      <p>The US president also launched a stinging attack on <a href="http://action.labour.org.uk/page/content/time-for-real-change">Britain's main opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn</a> and urged Johnson to unite with eurosceptic hardliner Nigel Farage, a key figure in the 2016 referendum on European Union membership.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Trump favours Farage</b>
      </p>
      <p>"Corbyn would be so bad for your country," Trump told Farage during a phone interview broadcast on his talkshow on British radio station LBC.</p>
      <p>"He'd take you in such a bad way. He'd take you into such bad places.</p>
      <p>"I'd like to see you and Boris get together... I think it'd be a great thing," Trump added.</p>
      <p>Farage, whose new <a href="http://www.thebrexitparty.org/">Brexit Party is campaigning for Britain to leave the EU without any deal</a> in place, has urged Johnson to form an electoral alliance but has so far been rebuffed.</p>
      <p>He is due to launch his party's election campaign on Friday.</p>
