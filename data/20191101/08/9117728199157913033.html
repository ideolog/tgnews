        <b><a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/kimi-raikkonen">Kimi Raikkonen</a> would rather closer racing in Formula 1 to the cars setting faster lap times. The new 2021 rule changes have made the cars better at following each other but they might be a bit slower than the current cars.

      <p><i>“I don’t think three, four, five seconds makes any difference,”</i> said Raikkonen to <a href="https://www.racefans.net/2019/11/01/raikkonen-if-the-racing-is-better-no-one-would-care-if-were-10-seconds-slower/"><i>RaceFans</i></a>. <i>“Like if you take qualifying, yes, we are fast. But you take the race we are probably five, six seconds with fuel and everything else.</i></p>

        <i>“I think even if we are 10 seconds slower, for people to watch the races, if it’s more exciting nobody cares. Every year the times are slightly different.”</i>

      <p>The whole objective of the 2021 rule changes was for more competitive racing and it seems that this might come as a consequence to lap times. The drivers don't seem to worry about that as long as the racing is close. </p>
