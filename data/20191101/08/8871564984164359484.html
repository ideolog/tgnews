      <h1>Australian national arrested after alleged drunken attack on hotel security in Bali</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T08:59:56+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 08:59</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/Coconuts%20Bali" target="_blank">Coconuts Bali</a></address>
      <p>An Australian national was detained by the police this week after he allegedly attacked security guards at a hotel in Kuta while he was drunk, authorities confirmed today. </p>
      <p>“We’ve detained him since two days ago. [When he was arrested] he was drunk,” <a href="http://www.balipost.com/news/2019/11/01/91447/Aniaya-Satpam,Warga-Australia-Ditahan.html">I Putu Ika Prabawa from the Kuta Police told <i>Bali Post.</i></a></p>
      <p>According to reports from local media, the incident occurred in the early hours of Wednesday. The foreigner, identified as Scott James Harrison, allegedly went on a rampage and lashed out at the security guards of the hotel he was staying at, who were trying to calm him down. </p>
      <p>The 40-year-old reportedly threw punches at three security guards, who suffered bruises and went on to file a police report soon after. </p>
      <p>“After the incident [and] because there was enough evidence, we arrested the suspect immediately,” Prabawa said. </p>
      <p>Under Indonesia’s Criminal Code, Harrison faces a maximum sentence of two years and eight months for the alleged assault. </p>
      <p>It certainly isn’t the first time a foreigner has been arrested for alleged assault in Bali. Earlier this week, a prosecutor in Denpasar demanded Nicholas Carr, the Australian man who was arrested after <a href="https://coconuts.co/bali/news/bali-prosecutor-demands-australian-who-fly-kicked-scooter-driver-be-sentenced-to-4-months-in-prison/">he allegedly fly-kicked a man off a moving scooter</a> in August, be sentenced to four months in prison.</p>
