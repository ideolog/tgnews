      <h1>‘Bitcoin of the Middle East’ Scam Lands Canadian Expat in Dubai Jail</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T08:49:00+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 08:49</time> by <a rel="author">Marie Huillet</a></address>
      <p>A Dubai-based Canadian expat has been arrested for peddling an allegedly fraudulent “Sharia-compliant” cryptocurrency and a host of other get-rich-quick schemes.</p>
      <p>As Gulf News <a href="https://gulfnews.com/uae/crime/aziz-com-mirza-arrested-in-dubai-for-fraud-1.67490190">reported</a> on Oct. 30, Aziz “Com” Mirza had cultivated for himself a reputation as an entrepreneur, mentor and Instagram influencer. </p>
      <p>He now sits in Al Awir jail after a complaint was filed with the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/dubai">Dubai</a> Police by a UAE resident allegedly defrauded of $150,000 in one of Com’s schemes.</p>
      <h3>The “Bitcoin of the Middle East”</h3>
      <p>Com targeted a global audience, including retail investors from the United States, United Kingdom, Canada and Greece. In just one of his schemes — dubbed the Leverage Programme (LP) and promising investors guaranteed “financial freedom” within a year — Com is thought to have raised £4 million ($5.18 million).</p>
      <p>His “Habibi coin” cryptocurrency, now worthless, was billed as the “Bitcoin of the Middle East”.</p>
      <p>Most of the funds from investors around the globe were wired to the bank account of a Dubai-based company owned by one of Com Mirza’s brothers, with huge amounts allegedly used to pay for personal expenses.</p>
      <p>Com and another of his brothers, Rafaqat “Rocky” Mirza, used U.K.-based online platform Muslim Entrepreneur Network (MEN) to promote their schemes, spanning cryptocurrency, real estate and education.</p>
      <p>One of the schemes encouraged MEN users to invest a minimum of £5,000 ($6,480)— at least 1,500 are cited as having signed up to the alleged scam. </p>
      <h3>“Com’s Instagram posts are now all about food and gym”</h3>
      <p>Gulf News cites the examples of several Habibi coin investors, each of whom has lost investments ranging from $1,500 to £14,000 ($18,150). Greece-based Ippokratis Boboras told Gulf news she had invested $10,000 in Habibi Coin back in 2018:</p>
      <blockquote>“I was familiar with Com Mirza through the internet marketing community where he was considered an authority. I had personal chats with him via Facebook and I sent money to his personal Paypal account,”</blockquote>
      <p>U.K. resident Mohammad Shareef reportedly lost £2000 ($2,590) in the Habibi scheme, underscoring that he had held off from investing until he met Com at his office in Dubai in person: </p>
      <blockquote>“We spoke for an hour. It wasn’t until this year that things started going down. Com’s Instagram posts are now all about food and gym. It’s been a sad experience for us. Until today there’s been no official word about what has happened with Habibi Coin.” </blockquote>
      <p>This summer, Cointelegraph <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/dutch-billionaire-yet-another-victim-of-deceptive-crypto-ads-sues-facebook">reported</a> on a wave of <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/facebook-and-instagram-now-have-a-problem-with-scam-libra-ad">fraudulent Libra and Bitcoin accounts</a> surfacing online —  including on Facebook itself and wholly-owned app Instagram.</p>
