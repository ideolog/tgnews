      <h1>Keep Calm and Good Samaritan On: Suspect-stopping ‘uncle’ praised for his cool (Video)</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T08:49:06+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 08:49</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/Coconuts%20Singapore" target="_blank">Coconuts Singapore</a></address>
      <p>A seven-minute video showing an alleged thief pleading for mercy from another man who managed to pin him down has been going <a href="https://coconuts.co/singapore/news/viral/">viral</a> this week. </p>
      <p>Footage shared Tuesday on the All Singapore Stuff page has been watched nearly 200,000 times since it was posted Tuesday. It depicts an unnamed 39-year-old man suspected of stealing a pair of headphones on Ang Mo Kio Avenue 1 begging for mercy from his captor. </p>

      <p>The man makes several attempts to escape but was pinned down by the other, older and very stoic  man. </p>
      <p>Giving up, the alleged thief then kneels down and kowtows, begs for leniency, at which point his human wall tells him coolly in Hokkien, “I gave you a chance but you didn’t take it.”</p>
      <p>The suspect remained in good citizen-detention until the police came to arrest him. </p>
      <p>Netizens gave big cheers to the so-called “uncle” for being a Good Samaritan, and his cool and calm demeanor throughout. </p>
      <p>“I admire the courage of the older man. Well done uncle!” Tan Hong Boon wrote.</p>
      <p>“This Uncle good sia, he kept him restrained without using unnecessary force. He could have given him a few punches when he attempted to escape,” Steve Pang wrote. “And I didn’t noticed this uncle swearing any vulgarity too! He had made this citizen arrest very civilised.”</p>
      <p>“There should be more people like him. Managed situations with calm and respect not by calling names and vulgarities to the culprit. Uncle is a gentleman with right attitude and his family should be proud of him,” Neng Ayu AR wrote. </p>
