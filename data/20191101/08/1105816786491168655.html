      <h1>Armeena Khan, OKB, Meesha Shafi react to Khalilur Rehman's remarks</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T08:29:09+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 08:29</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/5607/entertainment-desk/" target="_blank">Entertainment Desk</a></address>
      <p>Khalilur Rehman Qamar’s recent comments regarding women and infidelity have caused quite a stir in the showbiz industry and the audience.</p>
      <p>In a <i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cA6V1Qpax6Q&amp;t=421s">recent interview</a></i>, the writer went on to defend his ideas and ‘Philosophy’ around how he sees society.</p>
      <p>“Get someone to try me under #MeToo, I won’t care about that either. But I won’t be able to call every woman a woman. That simply isn’t true for me.”</p>
      <p>Qamar continued that when he saw the infidelity within women and the state of men, he went on, “A man leaves all his honour, his self-esteem with his wife when he goes out to earn a living. And I curse those women who violate that trust. That was the concept behind <i>Mere Pass Tum Ho</i> and so I’m fighting for the ‘good women’. It would be unfair to these [good] women to be classified along with those who aren’t loyal.”</p>
      <p>The <i>Kaaf Kangana</i> director further elaborated that he is a feminist to the core, but he is slightly selective about his politics.</p>
      <p>“Trust me, you’ll not find a bigger feminist in Pakistan, but I fight for good women only. Loyalty is a woman’s virtue; don’t challenge it.”</p>
      <p>Many came forward, baffled at the writer’s stance. Osman Khalid Butt, Ali Gul Pir, Armeena Khan, Meesha Shafi, Jami were few celebrities who commented on Qamar’s remarks.</p>
      <p>“And this guy is the most sought-after writer in our TV industry. If he is the one writing the dramas then you can expect the kind of s**t you see on TV,” Pir wrote.</p>

      <p>Questioning the silence of actors over Qamar’s remarks, Shafi shared, “Ummmm and how many actors, actresses, pro/dir and channels will put their foot down in response to these views and send a message of resistance here?”</p>
