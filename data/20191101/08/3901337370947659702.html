      <p>Following a spate of niggling injuries, Bale has seemingly fallen out of favour with Los Blancos once again after reclaiming his spot under manager Zinedine Zidane earlier this season.</p>
      <p>The relationship between the Wales talisman and the French manager is now reported to have reached breaking point, which has led to speculation that Bale could move to a club in China in January, after seeing a deal fall through at the beginning of the season.</p>
      <p>However, Jonathan Barnett, who is Bale's long-time agent, has since dismissed the rumours, claiming that the former Tottenham Hotspur winger is happy in Spain.</p>
      <p>"Gareth is delighted to play in Madrid," Barnett said, as reported by <i>The Independent.</i></p>
      <p>"China? Don't believe everything you hear."</p>

      <p>Zidane recently also hit back at reports that his relationship with Bale had soured, and insisted the 30-year-old remains an important part of his squad.</p>
      <p>"I don't think he ever talks about leaving. When he's available, he trains and plays. He's played a number of games," Zidane said.</p>
      <p>"I have to say we have a good relationship. He's here with us, he trains well and works well when he's available.</p>
      <p>"He's not available at the moment because he's got an injury, that's all.</p>
      <p>"The problem is, there is a lot of talk about lots of different things. The important thing is that he's ready when he's 100%.</p>
      <p>"He's a good player, you know what kind of player he is. At the moment, he's not available. You're all trying to create something that isn't there in our relationship."</p>

      <p>Bale joined Real for a then world record fee of €100 million (R1.6 billion) in 2013, and has since scored 104 goals in 238 appearances for the LaLiga giants.</p>
