      <h1>Google gives in to pressure again and brings back Google Chrome Close Other Tab option</h1>

      <p>Google has been working to simplify the menu options in the Google Chrome browser but has been getting a lot of push back every time they remove menu items.</p>
      <p>On the last occasion, Google had to restore the removed the Close Tab To The Right option, and today a new commit on the <a href="https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/1894758">Chromium Gerrit repository</a> confirms that Google is also returning the Close Other Tabs option, which lets you close all the tabs except the current one.</p>
      <p>The commit reads:</p>
      <blockquote>Re-add “Close Other Tabs” to tabstrip context menu.</blockquote>
      <p>It seems Google is fighting a losing battle against browser power users, and given that regular users probably never right-click on tabs,  we suggest the company may be better off focussing on other elements of the browser.</p>
