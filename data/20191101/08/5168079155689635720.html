      <p><b>Muscat: </b>Motorists in Oman will now be able to decorate their cars with stickers in commemoration of the upcoming National Day, the Royal Oman Police (ROP) said on Friday.<br/><br/>The Sultanate celebrates its National Day on November 18. The ROP made the announcement online and said, "Putting stickers is allowed from November 1 to November 30, 2019."<br/><br/>According to ROP regulations, motorists may place stickers on the body of their vehicles and on rear windows as long as the line of sight of the driver as well as that of vehicles coming from behind is not blocked."<br/><br/>Stickers must not cover plate numbers, lights, the front windshield and side windows, the ROP said. The only exception here is the fixed side windows of 4 wheel drive vehicles.</p>
      <p>Stickers must be fixed properly. Unfixed decorations, including decorations made of cloth, will not be allowed on vehicles and they cannot be put on the hood of the vehicle. Also, changing the shape or colour of the vehicle will not be allowed.</p>
