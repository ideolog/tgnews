      <p>India and Germany have resolved to intensify bilateral and multilateral cooperation to deal with the threats of terrorism and extremism, Prime Minister <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/narendra-modi">Narendra Modi </a>said on Friday after holding wide-raging talks with German Chancellor <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/angela-merkel">Angela Merkel.</a></p>
      <p>After the two leaders co-chaired the fifth Inter-Governmental Consultations, India and Germany signed five joint declarations of intent and inked 11 pacts in fields such as space, civil aviation, maritime technology, medicine and education.</p>
      <p>"We have vowed to build 'new India' by 2022 and expertise of technological, economic powerhouses like Germany will be useful for it," Modi said in his press statement after the meeting.</p>
      <p>"We have resolved to intensify bilateral and multilateral cooperation to deal with terrorism and extremism," he added.</p>
      <p>India and Germany will continue cooperation to expedite reforms in UN Security Council, Modi said.</p>
      <p>He said that India has invited Germany to take advantage of opportunities in defence production in the defence corridors in UP and Tamil Nadu.</p>
      <p>"We have decided to tap cooperation possibilities in e-mobility, smart cities, cleaning of rivers and environmental protection," Modi said.</p>
      <p>Merkel said agreements signed between Germany and India prove that ties are marching ahead in the areas of new and advanced technology. Areas of 5G and artificial intelligence are a challenge and it is important to work on them together, she said.</p>
      <p>"We will be happy to engage in big infrastructure projects which India is envisaging," Merkel said.</p>
