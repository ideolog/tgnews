      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 1): Lotte Chemical Titan Holdings Bhd's share price fell in early trades today, hitting an all-time low of RM2.43, after the group reported weak quarterly earnings yesterday.</p>
      <p>The stock recovered as trading progressed. At 3.46pm, the counter stood at RM2.46, down two sen or 0.81%, with a market capitalisation of RM5.68 billion.</p>
      <p>Year to date, the stock has fallen by about 44%.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, Lotte Chemical said its net profit fell 58% to RM91.3 million in the third quarter ended Sept 30, 2019, from RM216.89 million in the same period a year ago, as it continued to face a margin squeeze due to sliding average product selling prices of polymer products.</p>
      <p>The lower selling prices, it said, are mainly due to the diversion of cheaper polyolefin supply from the US into Southeast Asia that pressured regional product prices — no thanks to the US-China trade war — as well as a softening of global economic growth.</p>
      <p>Quarterly revenue decreased 10% year-on-year to RM2.17 billion from RM2.42 billion.</p>
      <p>According to <i>Bloomberg</i>, eight analysts cover Lotte Chemical. Two of them have buy calls, two have hold calls and four have sell calls.</p>
      <p>BIMB Securities Research said in a note today that Lotte Chemical's nine-month net profit was below the research house's and consensus forecast by 39% and 47% respectively.</p>
      <p>It has downgraded the recommendation on Lotte Chemical to Sell from Hold with a lower target price of RM2.</p>
      <p>The research house cut the earnings forecast by 36% to 63% for the financial years 2019 to 2021. The earnings downgrade also reflects the higher depreciation and effective tax rate.</p>
      <p>Going forward, the research house said it is cautious on the narrowing polymer spread (the segment accounts for 80% of revenue), particularly in view of the new supply from Petronas' Refinery and Petrochemical Integrated Development (RAPID).</p>
