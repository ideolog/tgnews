      <p>For over 14 years at Apple Inc , Rubén Caballero had to include a cable with every iPhone design whose wireless engineering he oversaw, from the first prototypes in 2005 to iPhone 11 models on shelves now.</p>
      <p>CAMPBELL, California: For over 14 years at Apple Inc , Rubén Caballero had to include a cable with every iPhone design whose wireless engineering he oversaw, from the first prototypes in 2005 to iPhone 11 models on shelves now.</p>
      <p>Now, as chief wireless strategist for Silicon Valley startup Keyssa Inc, Caballero hopes to cut the cord for good - for all smartphones. His new position has not been previously reported.</p>

      <p>Every iPhone since the first released in 2007 has come with a cable as a failsafe way to transfer data, as has virtually every other brand of phone.</p>
      <p>Keyssa wants to end that with its chip that can transfer data nearly as fast as a wire by placing two devices next to each other. Early customer LG Electronics Inc uses the chip to connect the second screen of its LG V50 smart phone.</p>
      <p>Wireless charging has taken hold in phones, but wireless data connections like Bluetooth and Wi-Fi remain too finicky to discard cables altogether.</p>
      <p>Keyssa has raised more than US$100 million (£77.31 million) from the venture groups at Intel Corp , Samsung Electronics Co Ltd , Foxconn parent Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd and a fund run by Tony Fadell, another former Apple executive who helped create the iPod and then hired Caballero for the original iPhone team.</p>
      <p>"Every single consumer product would love to solve the external connector," Caballero, who left Apple earlier this year, said in an interview at Keyssa's headquarters in Campbell, California.</p>
      <p>Caballero, a retired Canadian Air Force captain who favors all-black attire, also has his eyes on the inside of phones. There, cables cause engineering headaches.</p>
      <p>Camera modules connect to main circuit boards with a thin cables. Bend them enough and they break, creating an unintentional "beautiful antenna" that interferes with cellular data connections, Caballero said.</p>
      <p>With Keyssa's chips, camera modules could touch the circuit board to transmit data wirelessly. The chips use high frequencies that cause no interference inside the phone or with nearby devices.</p>
      <p>"What's beautiful about this is the frequency," Caballero said. "It just fixes a lot of problems."</p>
      <p>Aside from phones, Keyssa is testing chips with video display makers and at least one maker of lidar sensors, the electronic eyes of self-driving cars.</p>
      <p>"Ruben is a powerhouse when it comes to commercializing great technology," Fadell told Reuters.</p>
      <p>Caballero brings with him experience overseeing more than 1,000 Apple wireless engineers in a department with a budget of US$600 million for testing equipment alone.</p>
      <p>Before joining Apple, Caballero worked at two startups and relished the frenzied pace there and during his early days at Apple working with Fadell.</p>
      <p>When Fadell brought him to Apple in 2005, Caballero asked where all the test equipment and labs were for the group.</p>
      <p>"He said, 'We don't have anything, but we'll get it done,'" Caballero said. "You know when has something in his eyes – you can see the vision. After that, I was hooked. I used to sleep under my desk. When you have that passion, it's incredible. And I feel it here."</p>
