      <h1>Liverpool: Trent Alexander-Arnold reveals captaining Reds is something he has ‘always dreamed of’</h1>
      <h2>Alexander-Arnold is set to make his 100th appearance for the club this weekend</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T08:44:10+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 08:44</time> by <a rel="author">Harry Latham-Coyle</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/trent-alexander-arnold">Trent Alexander-Arnold</a> has revealed that becoming <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/LiverpoolFC">Liverpool</a> captain would be a “dream”.</p>
      <p>The right-back is set to make his 100th appearance for his boyhood club against <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/AstonVilla">Aston Villa</a> on Saturday.</p>
      <p>And Alexander-Arnold admits that the chance to captain Liverpool is something that motivates him.</p>
      <p>“I am not shy in saying that (being Liverpool captain) is a dream for me,” he said in <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50250019">an interview with the <i>BBC</i></a>.</p>
      <p>“Whether it comes true or not is not up to me. I don’t pick who is captain.</p>
      <p>“But that is something I would love to do one day. Captaining Liverpool is something I have always dreamed of and it is something that motivates me.”</p>
      <p>Alexander-Arnold joined the Liverpool academy at the age of six.</p>
      <p>He helped the Reds to back-to-back Champions League finals in his first two full seasons in the side, winning the second one, and broke the record for most assists in a <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/english-premier-league">Premier League</a> season by a defender last season, with 12.</p>
      <p>Liverpool lead the Premier League this season and are favourites for the title, and Alexander-Arnold has no desire to move elsewhere.</p>
      <p>“I’ve always been a Liverpool player, Liverpool has always been my home,” he added.</p>
      <p>“I have never thought about changing clubs. When I grew up, the dream was always to play for Liverpool.</p>
      <p>“Now I am living the dream and I can’t see that changing.”</p>
