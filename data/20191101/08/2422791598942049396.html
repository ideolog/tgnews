      <p>MONTREAL -- While the rest of Canada wakes up with a sugar junky's remorse this morning, residents of some Quebec communities will only venture out this evening to get their Halloween stash.</p>
      <p>The decision by some Quebec towns and cities -- including Montreal -- to ask trick-or-treaters to hold off due to bad weather didn't go over well with all parents.</p>
      <p>Laura Hodges, a mother of three from Boucherville, says families can make their own decisions when it comes to safety, and moving Halloween on short notice was overkill.</p>
      <p>A few dozen communities began making the call Wednesday to postpone the annual candy collection, as weather forecasters predicted heavy rains and high winds.</p>
      <p>The trend culminated with <a href="https://twitter.com/Val_Plante/status/1189928304540880897?s=20">Montreal Mayor Valerie Plante tweeting </a>that the nasty forecast was enough to ask parents and kids to wait one night to collect their candy, citing public safety.</p>
      <p>As criticism mounted on social media under the hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/halloweengate?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Ehashtag">#Halloweengate</a>, Plante fired back, saying in a tweet: "Damn(ed) if you do, damn(ed) if you don't."</p>
