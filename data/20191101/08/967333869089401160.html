        <b>Agent 007 has had many faces over the 57-year cinematic history of Ian Fleming's jet-setting British spy.

      <p>Harry Styles, a 25-year-old singer formerly of the UK boy band One Direction recently disclosed that he'd love to replace Daniel Craig as the the next James Bond.</p>
      <blockquote>"I grew up watching those. You know, I loved him when I was a kid. So I think it's kind of everyone's dream a little bit, right?" Harry said, speaking to Hits Radio about the next Bond.</blockquote>
      <p>However, at the moment, he is focused on his music career; his new single Lights Up was among the UK's top 10 singles last week.</p>
      <blockquote>“For me it’s a very uplifting song. It’s very ­liberating,” he said.</blockquote>
      <p>In any event, origins stories are popular these days and Harry Styles could be perfectly suited to play a young Agent 007. It may seem like a stretch, but Doctor Who is a woman now, so you never know.</p>
