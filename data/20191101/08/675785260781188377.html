      <h1>Drivers to get £200 fines if they even touch phones thanks to new traffic cameras</h1>
      <h2>Transport secretary Grant Shapps has said a legal loophole allowing drivers to browse the internet while driving will be closed</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T08:11:15+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 08:11</time> by <a rel="author">Milo Boyd, David Bentley, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/milo-boyd/</a></address>
      <p>Drivers who are caught touching their phones for even the briefest moments while driving will soon be convicted as new HD cameras are trialled.</p>
      <p>An urgent review has been called by transport secretary Grant Shapps to tighten a loophole which allows motorists caught with their hands on their phones to avoid punishment.</p>
      <p>At the moment police have to catch those behind the wheel calling, texting or engrossed in some other kind of 'interactive communication' to bring a successful charge, <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/mobile-phone-driving-law-tightened-17181745">Birmingham Mail reported.</a></p>
      <p>The issue was brought to light earlier this year when Ramsey Barreto successfully appealed a conviction he received for filming the scene of a crash while driving.</p>
      <p>His lawyers argued UK laws only forbade driving while communicating on a phone, not simply holding a mobile.</p>
      <p>The Department for Transport is working to close the loophole so anyone spotted texting, taking photos, browsing the internet, scrolling through a music playlist or doing anything else on their phone behind the wheel can be prosecuted.</p>

      <p>It is expected the proposals will be in place by 2020.</p>
      <p>When they are in force, offenders will receive six points and a fine of up to £200.</p>
      <p>Last month RAC research found that 35 per cent of drivers under the age of 25 – and 17 per cent of drivers overall – admitted taking their eyes off the road to check texts, email or social media. </p>
      <p>The action follows a recent report by the Commons' Transport Select Committee which urged the Government to introduce tougher restrictions on using a mobile phone while driving.</p>
      <p>The committee also recommended that ministers should consider a ban on hands-free use, but the DfT announced there are no plans to introduce such a measure.</p>
      <p>In 2018, there were 683 casualties on Britain's roads - including 29 deaths and 118 serious injuries - in crashes where a driver using a mobile was a contributory factor.</p>
      <p>Since March 2017, motorists caught using a hand-held phone have faced incurring six points on their licence and a £200 fine - up from the previous penalty of three points and £100.</p>
      <p>"This review will look to tighten up the existing law to bring it into the 21st century, preventing reckless driving and reduce accidents on our roads," Mr Shapps said.</p>

      <p>Labour MP Lilian Greenwood, who chairs the committee, described the announcement as "great news" but warned that "the risk from hands-free devices is just as real".</p>
      <p>She said: "While we're pleased that ministers will prioritise work on hand-held mobiles, this issue still needs to be addressed."</p>
      <p>Ahead of the law change Highways England will trialing roadside cameras which automatically take pictures of drivers using their phones.</p>
      <p>The high-definition cameras would be fixed to overhead gantries and take crystal-clear photos of drivers through their windscreens.</p>
      <p>The images would be sent to police and notices of intended prosecution posted to the vehicle’s owner in the same way as speeding penalties.</p>
