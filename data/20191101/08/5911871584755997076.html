      <p>The people behind <i>Charlie’s Angels</i>, the new reboot movie situation that I can’t imagine anyone is all that excited to see, have attempted to pull a Kendrick Lamar/<i>Black Panther</i> trick. They’ve brought Ariana Grande in to serve as an executive producer of the film’s soundtrack album, and it features a couple of Grande-led superstar team-ups. We’ve already heard “<a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2058181/ariana-grande-miley-cyrus-lana-del-rey-dont-call-me-angel/video/">Don’t Call Me Angel</a>,” the lead single, which comes from Grande, Miley Cyrus, and Lana Del Rey. And today, the soundtrack is out, so we get to hear the other one.</p>
      <p>The <i>Charlie’s Angels</i> soundtrack has appearances from people like Kim Petras, Kash Doll, Stefflon Don, and Chaka Khan. And it’s got “Bad To You,” a song that features Grande and a couple of her friends — longtime collaborator Nicki Minaj and new collaborator Normani. (Grande co-wrote “Motivation,” the single that the former Fifth Harmony member released in August.)</p>
      <p>Clips from “Bad For You” leaked out onto the internet last year; it was originally going to be a Grande/Dua Lipa collab. In its current form, the song has eight credited songwriters, including Grande, Minaj, Normani, and producers Danny Boy Styles, ILYA, and OG pop-music wizard Max Martin. It’s a slow-strutting skank about a dysfunctional relationship, and you can hear it below.</p>
