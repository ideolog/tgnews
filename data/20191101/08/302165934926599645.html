      <p>LONDON, Nov 1 — Euro zone government bond yields steadied near two-week lows today and were set for their biggest weekly decline in five weeks as Christine Lagarde began her presidency of the European Central Bank.</p>
      <p>A US interest rate cut and renewed concern about US-China trade talks have boosted bond markets this week, pushing euro zone yields down after they recorded their biggest monthly rise since early 2018 in October, as worries about a no-deal Brexit eased.</p>
      <p>Analysts said the resumption of asset purchases by the ECB this week also helped euro zone bonds, with focus turning to the policy outlook under Lagarde, whose eight-year term began today.</p>
      <p>Creating the broadest possible consensus and making sure the ECB speaks with one voice should be Lagarde’s top priorities, current and former policymakers told Reuters.</p>
      <p>The decision to resume asset purchases has divided the central bank and fuelled a perception in markets that the bar to further monetary easing is high.</p>
      <p>Having discounted an ECB depo rate of close to -0.8 per cent just a couple of months ago, the market no longer discounts another cut of 10 basis points in 2020.</p>
      <p>“It’s pretty clear that Lagarde has an uphill task in trying to promote unity that leads to a coherent set of policies going forward,” said Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec. “Her own views can be characterised as continuity with” former ECB chief Mario Draghi.</p>
      <p>In early trade today, most 10-year bond yields were little changed, near two-week lows struck yesterday.</p>
      <p>Germany’s 10-year Bund yield was around -0.40 per cent, near yesterday’s low of -0.42 per cent.It is down around three basis points this week and set for its biggest weekly drop in five weeks.</p>
      <p>French and Dutch 10-year bond yields were also set for their biggest weekly falls since late September.</p>
      <p>Lagarde will initially keep her predecessor’s top aides, including his personal adviser, two sources close to the matter told Reuters yesterday.</p>
      <p>“At the margin (this) might be a positive given policy continuity although it might depend on what you think of current policies,” Jim Reid, a strategist at Deutsche Bank, said in a note.</p>
      <p>Lagarde will make her first public speech as ECB chief on Monday.</p>
      <p>Focus was expected to turn to US data later today. Monthly jobs numbers and the Institute for Supply Management’s index of manufacturing activity are due.</p>
      <p>Forecasts are the US economy created 89,000 new jobs in October, fewer than the 136,000 created in September, according to a Reuters poll. — Reuters</p>
