      <p><a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/mamamoo">MAMAMOO</a> opened up about winning the final performance on <b>Mnet</b>'s '<b>Queendom</b>'.<br/><br/>On the October 31st finale of 'Queendom', MAMAMOO ended up taking the top spot over <b>Lovelyz</b>, <b>Park Bom</b>, <b>AOA</b>, <b>(G)I-DLE</b>, and <b>Oh My Girl</b>. Member <b>Solar</b> expressed, <i>"A lot of people worked hard during 'Queendom'. I want to tell them for sure that they worked hard. To our fans <b>Moomoo</b>! Thank you so much, and I think this award was won with all of our effort. Thank you."<br/><br/></i>Rapper <b>Moon Byul </b>said, <i>"I think Moomoo were the ones who completed what we lacked. We were able to come here because of Moomoo. It was also good because I learned a lot during 'Queendom', and I think all 6 teams are #1. I hope that you look on all of us kindly in the future. Thank you." </i><b>Whee In</b> shared, <i>"Thank you for giving us so much interest and love. I think it'll remain as a meaningful time for us because it's given MAMAMOO a lot of help on our road in the future. I love all the people who worked hard and my members."</i><br/><br/><b>Hwa Sa</b> showed tears as she expressed, <i>"I didn't expect that we would take 1st at all, and I really didn't imagine that I would cry. That moment caught me so offguard. I'm thankful to many people, but I think I unknowingly suffered emotionally during that time. I wasn't able to say thank you during the live performance like I meant to, but I want to say it right now. Thank you so much. I also give a lot of thanks and love to Moomoo." </i></p>
      <p>As a prize for winning, MAMAMOO will be opening a solo comeback show.</p>
