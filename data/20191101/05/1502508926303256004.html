      <h2>The downturn in overall business activity and demand suggests the Reserve Bank of India might need to ease policy again, a survey showed</h2>

      <p>Manufacturing activity in the country continued to weaken in October, with factory orders and production rising at the weakest rates in two years, a monthly survey said on Friday.</p>
      <p>The headline seasonally adjusted IHS Markit India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to a two-year low of 50.6 in October from 51.4 in September.</p>
      <p>This indicates only a marginal improvement in the health of the manufacturing industry, the survey said.</p>
      <p>In PMI parlance, a print above 50 means expansion, while a score below that denotes contraction.</p>
      <p>As per the IHS Markit survey, the cooling of manufacturing sector conditions in India continued in October, with both factory orders and production rising at the weakest rates for two years.</p>
      <p>"Subsequently, job creation softened to a six-month low, while companies were reluctant to hold excess stock and lowered input buying in response," it noted.</p>
      <p>The PMI data for October showed a continuation of manufacturing sector weakness in India, "with sales growth softening to the slowest in two years", said Pollyanna De Lima, Principal Economist at IHS Markit.</p>
      <p>"Weakening demand had a domino effect in the manufacturing industry, knocking down rates of increase in production, employment and business sentiment," Lima said.</p>
      <p>With quantities of purchases contracting for the third month in a row, Lima pointed out that input costs fell for the first time in over four years during October.</p>
