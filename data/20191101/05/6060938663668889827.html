      <h1>Sebastian Vettel warns F1 going in 'wrong direction' with heavier, slower cars</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T05:41:15+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 05:41</time> by <a rel="author">AFP</a></address>
      <p>AUSTIN: <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Sebastian-Vettel">Sebastian Vettel</a> warned on Thursday that <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Formula-One">Formula One</a> was going in the "wrong direction" by reverting to heavier and slower cars, as unveiled in the sport's launch of its new regulations for 2021 and beyond.</p>
      <p>Lap times for the proposed new cars are forecast to be more than three seconds greater on average than they are this season -- and a step back into the past.</p>
      <p>"The cars are more spectacular now, and have been since 2017," he said referring to the introduction of the current record-breaking breed of <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/F1">F1</a> cars.</p>
      <p>"Before that, I think it was quite slow. Now, we know what these cars can do. It is more exciting."</p>
      <p>The Ferrari driver said he felt that it was not wrong to seek to make the cars faster still.</p>
      <p>"The wrong direction, in my point of view, is that the cars are so heavy which is obviously related to some of the safety measures, but I think everybody accepts that."</p>
      <p>In the past, prior to 2017, he said the cars "had very little drag and were great in a straight line, but that's not the exciting bit for us and it (the average speed) was significantly slower than maybe some years earlier."</p>
      <p>In 2017, the revised cars were designed to try and reduce lap times significantly and succeeded, trimming up to 5.5 seconds off a lap at Barcelona's Circuit de Catalunya and 2.3 seconds elsewhere.</p>
      <p>Lap records were broken regularly.</p>
      <p>Four-time world champion Vettel, however, welcomed the prospect of closer racing.</p>
      <p>"Obviously, on paper, the ideas are always great," he said. "But I think it will materialise a little bit more in the coming weeks.</p>
      <p>"So we'll see in the end of the day. No matter how the cars look, if the racing is better for us, if it's more fun, then that's a win."</p>
      <p>The FIA's head of single-seater matters Nikolas Tombazis estimated the new cars for 2021 would be "between three and three and a half seconds slower per lap."</p>
      <p>He added: "We don't think (performance) is the key parameter of the spectacle. We feel that the race-ability is the main target. We haven't been focussing on an exact level of performance."</p>
      <p>F1's motorsport chief Ross Brawn said he did not see any problem in slower cars and lap times.</p>
      <p>"These cars, remember, from 2016 to 2017, had a huge increase in down-force," he explained.</p>
      <p>"It's worth thinking back on that experience because it was done for reasons I don't understand.</p>
      <p>"The huge increase in down-force was 'let's make the cars go faster, that must make F1 better'. Well, all we've done is we've actually made it worse because the cars can't race each other.</p>
      <p>"It's an example of an un-thought-through programme. So the cars are very quick now, but they're not race-able.</p>
      <p>"And the reality is that the performance of these new cars is going to be about where we were in 2016."</p>
