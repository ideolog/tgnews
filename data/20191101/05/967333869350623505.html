      <p>The Politico news outlet has added that McAleenan was initially supposed to leave office on Thursday but he would stay until 7 November.</p>
      <blockquote>"This is an outstanding pick by the President. Chad is uniquely qualified to lead the Department and he’s widely respected within DHS and the interagency community for his experience and vision", a senior Trump administration official told Politico.</blockquote>
      <p>There were concerns that Wolf might have disagreements with Trump on the president's tough migration policy, the outlet has said citing several sources within the administration. Wolf is known to be a registered lobbyist for an association of IT companies that seek to keep a visa program for skilled foreign workers in place.</p>
      <p>​Upon taking up the position, Chad Wolf, who stays in charge of the Department of Homeland Security's policy office, would become the fifth person to lead the agency under the current administration.</p>

      <p>In April, <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201904081073905920-usa-dhs-secretary-resign/">then-US Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen</a>, who served before as the commissioner of US Customs and Border Protection, said that she was going to be replaced by McAleenan as the head of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) that month.</p>
      <p>All the personnel changes have been taken place amid Trump's migration policies that have drawn criticism from inside and outside the United States.</p>
