      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 1 — The Royal Malaysia Police (PDRM) will not tolerate officers lacking integrity and trustworthiness, Deputy Inspector-General of Police Datuk Mazlan Mansor said in a severe warning today.</p>
      <p>Speaking at the closing ceremony of a three-day seminar for around 156 district police chiefs from around the country, Mazlan said the law enforcement agency would not hesitate to replace those found wanting.</p>
      <p>He stressed that a culture of integrity must be instilled in the force, with district chiefs taking the lead and setting an example for their subordinates.</p>
      <p>Mazlan conceded that pockets of indiscipline and crime remained in the force, before warning them that there were plenty who were eager and waiting to take their places.</p>
      <p>“We found out that from our intake, there are a lot of people who want to join the force as there were 6,000 vacancies with around 37,000 people applicants.</p>
      <p>“If one leaves the force there are many who can replace them.</p>
      <p>“That is why I hope officers and those within PDRM will understand the primary goals of the force,” he said.</p>
      <p>Mazlan explained to the press that the seminar stressed the importance of good governance among  district police chiefs as they were seen as representatives of the force.</p>
      <p>Other topics addressed during the seminar included community engagement, service delivery, and the agency’s reputation.</p>
      <p>He said officers were reminded that the PDRM was still dimly viewed by sections of society, with efforts necessary to correct this.</p>
      <p>“It is pointless if we boast of our successes of crime fighting one after another but still fail at winning the hearts of the society through quality service delivery.</p>
      <p>“I believe a large number of those within society still have a poor understanding of how the police work, especially from the aspect of investigations and case development.</p>
      <p>“So we stressed that there has to be engagement with society and those within the community who require help, that we respond to them, and don’t stay silent; this is a condition that we need to remedy among our officers,” he said.</p>
