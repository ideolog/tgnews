      <h1>WTO panel rules India export subsidies illegal, upholds US case</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T05:33:21+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 05:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/77/reuters/" target="_blank">Reuters</a></address>
      <p><b>GENEVA: </b>A World Trade Organisation (WTO) panel ruled on Thursday that Indian export subsidies are prohibited and should be removed, upholding a complaint brought by the United States.</p>
      <p>The panel largely agreed with US claims challenging export subsidies granted in the form of exemptions from customs duties and a national tax, while rejecting some US arguments. It called on India to withdraw the export-contingent subsidies within periods varying from 90 to 180 days.</p>
      <p>The US Trade Representative’s Office, in a statement, said that the panel had agreed that India provides prohibited subsidies to Indian exporters worth more than $7 billion annually, including producers of steel products, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, IT products and textiles.</p>
