      <p>Blizzard Entertainment kicked off its annual BlizzCon fan expo today with a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20944022/blizzard-blizzcon-hearthstone-china-hong-kong-response-j-allen-brack">direct apology from president J. Allen Brack</a> regarding the <a href="https://slashdot.org/story/19/10/08/1641206/activision-blizzard-suspends-hearthstone-pro-player-for-supporting-hong-kong-protests">explosive Hong Kong controversy</a> that's <a href="https://games.slashdot.org/story/19/10/30/188253/blizzard-sponsor-bailed-after-free-hong-kong-gamer-ban">engulfed the company for the past month</a>. From a report:<i> "Blizzard had the opportunity to bring the world together in a tough Hearthstone e-sports moment about a month ago. We did not. We moved too quickly in our decision-making and then to make matters worse, we were too slow to talk to all of you," Brack said onstage during the beginning of the BlizzCon opening ceremony. "When I think about how most unhappy I am, I think about two things. We didn't live up to the higher standards we set for ourselves. Second, we failed in our purpose. For that, I am sorry, and I accept accountability."</i></p>
