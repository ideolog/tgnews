      <h1>Junius Ho sues 3 pro-democracy lawmakers for libel over remarks at water cannon demonstration</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T05:40:07+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 05:40</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/Coconuts%20Hong%20Kong" target="_blank">Coconuts Hong Kong</a></address>
      <p>If you thought fiery pro-Beijing lawmaker Junius Ho — currently facing a potential lawsuit and newly doctorate-less after his alma mater stripped his honorary degree — might take a break from the spotlight and make some time for quiet introspection, well, buddy, you don’t know Junius Ho.</p>
      <p>According to NOW TV News, Ho has announced he is suing lawmakers Dennis Kwok, Claudia Mo, and Lam Cheuk-ting — the man behind the legal action against Ho — for chanting “Junius Ho, triad” at <a href="https://news.now.com/home/local/player?newsId=368331">a police demonstration of their new water cannon trucks on Aug. 12</a>.</p>
      <p>The TV station reported that in a High Court filing, Ho said the remarks were unfounded and not true, and demanded damages and an injunction to prevent the trio from making similar statements.</p>
      <p>The remarks in question were made at an event at the police tactical unit in Fanling attended by members of the Legislative Council. Kwok, Lam, and Mo <a href="https://coconuts.co/hongkong/news/pro-dems-question-need-for-water-cannon-crowd-control-trucks-as-police-show-off-capabilities/">staged a protest during the demonstration</a> by holding placards accusing the police of “attempted murder.” Ho at one point called the protesting lawmakers “bloody idiots,” as he is wont to do.</p>
      <p>In a video filmed by <i>Ming Pao</i>, some lawmakers can be heard saying “Junius Ho, triad.” Pro-democracy lawmaker Au Nok-hin can also be heard yelling to police “sir, this guy is a triad.”</p>

      <p>Ho has been accused of being in cahoots with the triads ever since a video was released of him <a href="https://coconuts.co/hongkong/news/junius-ho-got-chummy-with-yuen-long-assailants-calls-their-values-heroic-in-presser/">shaking hands with some of the white-shirted men connected to the July 21 attack</a> at Yuen Long MTR, in which pro-democracy protesters, commuters, and journalists were beaten by a mob armed with metal rods and bamboo sticks.</p>
      <p>Some of those later arrested in connection with the attack had links to triads.</p>
      <p>According to an on.cc report from late last night, <a href="https://hk.on.cc/hk/bkn/cnt/news/20191031/bkn-20191031230359139-1031_00822_001.html">a 61-year-old man is the latest to be arrested on rioting charges</a> in connection with the incident — often referred to as 721 — bringing the total number of people arrested to 32.</p>
      <p>Ho has continued to deny any involvement with the 721 incident, and last week accused Lam — one of the people he’s suing — of inciting the attack.</p>
      <p>Lam, who was one of the people injured in the 721 incident, responded on Monday by saying <a href="https://coconuts.co/hongkong/news/pro-democracy-lawmaker-sues-junius-ho-over-allegations-made-in-facebook-live-video/">he would initiate legal proceedings unless Ho retracted his comments</a> and payed tens of thousands of dollars in damages and legal fees.</p>
