      <p><b>MG Australia</b> has announced a pre-sale offer for its first electric vehicle – the <b>ZS EV</b> – priced from <b>$46,990 drive-away</b> for the <b>first 100 orders</b>.</p>
      <p>Available to pre-order now in Australia, the <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/tag/mg-zs-ev/">ZS EV</a> is powered by a <b>105kW/353Nm electric motor</b> on the front axle, hooked up to a <b>44.5kWh</b> water-cooled lithium-ion battery pack.</p>
      <p>The company claims the ZS EV will offer <b>262 kilometres</b> of driving range on the combined cycle (WLTP), and can be recharged to 80 per cent in just 40 minutes using a 50kW fast-charge point.</p>
      <p>Using the standard 7kW home charge unit, owners can fully charge their vehicle in seven hours.</p>

      <p>Standard features for the all-electric crossover will include an 8.0-inch touchscreen with satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, six-speaker audio, and a panoramic sunroof.</p>
      <p>The ZS EV will be covered by a <b>seven year, 160,000km new vehicle warranty</b> and a seven-year battery warranty when it arrives in 2020.</p>
      <p>Key rivals for the ZS EV include the recently-facelifted <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/hyundai/ioniq/">Hyundai Ioniq Electric</a> and the <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/nissan/leaf/">Nissan Leaf</a>, priced from $48,490 plus on-road costs and $49,990 plus on-road costs respectively.</p>
      <p>Both competing hatchbacks have marginally more claimed driving range to go with the higher asking price – with the Ioniq now rated at 311km while the Leaf quotes 270km, both on the stricter WLTP test cycle.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/mg/">MG's</a> pre-launch announcement was made at the opening of the brand's new flagship showroom – Sydney City MG – located in Alexandria.</p>
      <p>"The new 1100sqm two-level showroom is located in Alexandria’s coveted automotive hub, promising to deliver a trusted and convenient sales experience for the brand’s expanding customer base," MG says in its media release.</p>
      <p>MG, a subsidiary of China's <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/category/saic-motor/">SAIC Motor</a> group, is enjoying a rapidly growing presence in the Australian market this year.</p>
      <p>So far in 2019 the formerly British marque is up by <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/798115/vfacts-chinas-mg-tripling-sales-2019/">more than 200 per cent year-to-date</a> (as of September 30), with key drivers being the revised MG3 light hatch and petrol-powered ZS crossovers.</p>
      <p>Last month 835 MGs were registered in Australia, with 5795 units sold YTD to the end of September. It seems those numbers will just continue to get larger.</p>
