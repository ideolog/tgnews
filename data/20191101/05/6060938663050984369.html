      <p>BHUBANESWAR: Odisha has been the traditional hotbed of Indian hockey, and it's not just restricted to men. The state has been a nursery for the women's national team as well, but never before have the locals had the chance to root for the women in large numbers.</p>
      <p>The Olympic qualifying event against USA, beginning Friday, provides them that long overdue chance. In front of a capacity 15,000 crowd expected in the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Kalinga-Stadium">Kalinga Stadium</a> stands, it's going to be a home experience like never before for the Indian women's team.</p>
      <p>Though it's not for the first time that the India women are playing Olympic qualifiers at home, it's going to be different on more than one count, compared to 2012 in Delhi, because (1) the focus on women's hockey has grown since qualification for 2016 Rio <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Olympics">Olympics</a>, (2) the team has improved considerably in the last four years, (3) they have never before played in a jam-packed stadium and (4) the team has to prove that the 4-29 win-loss record against the Americans doesn't reflect India's growing stature in women's hockey accurately.</p>

      <p>But it's not going to be easy, even if India boast eight players with 150 or more international caps compared to just one for the Americans (captain Kathleen Sharkey). Among the four Indian players with an experience of 200 or more internationals is Odisha girl Deep Grace Ekka (200 matches). Captain Rani Rampal leads that list with 239 caps, followed by Vandana Katariya (238) and goalkeeper Savita (200)</p>
      <p>Not that US women would have ever played either in front of 15,000 screaming fans, but the pressure is likely to be more on the home team.</p>
      <p>And India's vice-captain, Savita, admits that.</p>

      <p>"Everybody talks about home crowd, but it's more pressure on the home team," the veteran said talking to Timesofindia.com.</p>
      <p>"When we came to know we will be playing at home against USA, we talked as much about the crowd as about our game-plan, because there are many young players in the team who would not know about such an atmosphere," Savita added.</p>
      <p>Among those youngsters are teenagers Sharmila Devi (7 caps), Lalremsiami (62 caps) and Salima Tete (27 caps).</p>
      <p>In Delhi, seven years ago, India failed to make it to the London Olympics, losing to South Africa in the final; but this team led by Rani Rampal has ticked quite a few boxes to earn respect from opponents.</p>
      <p>The 2018 Asian Games silver medallists, coached by Dutchman Sjoerd Marijne, have upped their fitness levels considerably with the help of scientific approach towards training. Exposure trips to Europe have helped both the individuals and the team grow. More importantly, the team would want to prove that qualifying for Rio 2016 was not a flash in the pan.</p>
      <p>Handling pressure, though, amid loud cheers could hold the key to decide who among India and USA qualify for the Tokyo Games.</p>
      <p>"If your objectives are in place and you know what you have to do, then you don't think about crowd pressure and don't let yourself get overwhelmed by it or by thoughts of the end result," Savita continued.</p>
      <p>And then ended with a punch line to gee up the hockey lovers in Odisha ahead of Friday evening's encounter.</p>
      <p>"They are our well wishers at the end of the day."</p>
