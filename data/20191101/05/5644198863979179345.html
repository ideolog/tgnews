      <p>LONDON: President Donald Trump on Thursday (Oct 31) criticised British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Brexit divorce deal, saying it made it impossible to strike a future commercial agreement with the United States.</p>
      <p>"This deal ... you can't do it, you can't trade. We can't make a trade deal with the UK," he said in an interview with Brexit campaign figurehead Nigel Farage on the UK's LBC radio.</p>

      <p>Trump's comments stand at odds with his previous pledge in September that he was working closely with Johnson to strike a "magnificent trade deal" once Britain left the European Union.</p>
      <p>Johnson struck the terms for the UK's departure with Brussels earlier this month but has been unable to push it through parliament.</p>
      <p>He hopes a general election, scheduled for Dec 12, will break the deadlock, giving him a majority that will help him get the enabling legislation approved.</p>
      <p>The US president's intervention came effectively on the first full day of campaigning that saw Johnson tour a school and don a white coat for a hospital visit.</p>
      <p>In parliament on Wednesday he said he had struck a "fantastic deal" with the EU, and on Thursday promised Britain would meet the latest Brexit deadline of Jan 31 next year.</p>
      <p>Trump told Farage "we can do many times the numbers that we're doing right now - and certainly much bigger numbers than you're doing under the European Union".</p>
      <p>Farage, a close Trump ally, criticised then-US president Barack Obama in 2016 for "interfering" in British democracy after he commented on possible US-UK trade deals post-Brexit.</p>
      <p>The former City trader has remained tight-lipped about speculation he could form an electoral pact with Johnson to avoid splitting the pro-Brexit vote.</p>
      <p>Farage's Brexit Party, which won the biggest share of votes at European Parliament elections in May, has its official campaign launch on Friday.</p>
      <p>But Trump said: "I'd like to see you and Boris get together because you'd really have some numbers, because you did fantastically in the last election, and he respects you a lot."</p>
      <p>He added: "I think it'd be a great thing."</p>
      <p>Farage said he would be "right behind" Johnson but only "if he drops this dreadful deal".</p>
