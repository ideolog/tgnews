      <h1>What to Do if You're Not Seeing Your Apple TV+ 1-Year Free Trial Offer</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T05:39:19+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 05:39</time> by <a rel="author">Tim Hardwick</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>+ officially launched on November 1, and anyone who purchased an iPhone, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, ‌Apple TV‌, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipod-touch/">iPod touch</a>, or Mac after September 10 can get a year's subscription to it for free.</p>

      <p>The free one-year trial can be activated in the ‌Apple TV‌ app at launch on any qualifying Apple device. However, we've heard reports that some <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-11/">iPhone 11</a> owners aren't seeing the trial they're entitled to in the TV app. <br/><br/>If the trial isn't showing up for you on your device, here's a solution that appears to be working for many people.</p>

      <p>Open a desktop web browser, go to <a href="https://tv.apple.com/">https://tv.apple.com</a> and log in using your Apple ID credentials. You should be able to accept the 1-year free trial offer from there. Then on your iPhone, sign out of the TV app, close it, then launch the app and sign in again. <br/><br/>Your one-year free ‌Apple TV‌+ trial should hopefully now be active.</p>
      <h3>1-Year Subscription to ‌Apple TV‌+ Offers Savings</h3>
      <p>Also today, Apple quietly added a one-year plan to its subscription options for the video streaming service.</p>

      <p>A one-year ‌Apple TV‌+ subscription offers a $9.89 annual saving over the $4.99 monthly plan (around a 15 percent discount). Users can select it without affecting their free one year trial by going to the <b>Account</b> section of the TV app: <b>Manage Subscriptions -&gt; ‌Apple TV‌+</b>. <br/><br/><i>(Thanks, orbitalpunk!)</i></p>
