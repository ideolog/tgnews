      <p><b>ISLAMABAD: </b>Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam Fazl’s Azadi March gained momentum as Pakistan Peoples Party Chairman Bilawal Bhutto shared stage with the JUI-F chief in a late-night address to the crowd.</p>
      <p>In his address to the marchers, Bilawal said, “I am here to represent PPP whose founder gave a democratic Constitution in 1973. However, some forces do not want to see the people of Pakistan as a powerful force.”</p>
      <p>“Today democracy is under attack and we are being ripped off from our democratic rights.”</p>
