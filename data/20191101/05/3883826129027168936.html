        <b>An Australian reality TV show contestant has been arrested for allegedly assaulting her Tinder date and extorting money from him.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Suzi Taylor, 49, demanded money after arranging through the dating app to meet the man at a Brisbane house on Wednesday, police said.</p>
      <p>When he refused to pay, another man allegedly entered the room and assaulted the 33-year-old victim.</p>
      <p>Ms Taylor appeared on a hit home renovations show, The Block, in 2015.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, she and a 22-year-old man were arrested and charged with extortion, assault, deprivation of liberty and other offences.</p>
      <p>According to Queensland Police, the pair had held the victim against his will and forced him to transfer money into a bank account.</p>
      <p>They also allegedly stole his bank card and made a cash withdrawal. Neither amount was made public by police.</p>
