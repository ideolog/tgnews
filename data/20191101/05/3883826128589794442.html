        <figcaption>The Telegraph leads on Donald Trump urging Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage to strike a deal with the PM to prevent Jeremy Corbyn from taking the UK to "bad places". The paper says Mr Farage's interview of Mr Trump was timed to coincide with the Brexit Party's election launch.</figcaption>

        <figcaption>Mr Trump's comments on LBC weren't only a knock for Mr Corbyn - they also "derailed" the PM's first day on the campaign trail, the Times says. The president criticised Mr Johnson's Brexit deal, saying it would block rather than boost trade with the US.</figcaption>

        <figcaption>The president's words were an "extraordinary" intervention in the UK general election, the Daily Express said. Mr Trump told Mr Farage he and the PM could join to become "an unstoppable force" in UK politics. The paper pictures the "pals" Mr Trump and Mr Farage together.</figcaption>

        <figcaption>The Mail says the interview "piled pressure" on Mr Farage to work with Mr Johnson. Earlier this week the Brexit Party leader refused to confirm reports it was withdrawing hundreds of election candidates in order to focus its campaign on a small number of Leave-voting Labour seats.</figcaption>

        <figcaption>Steering clear of the LBC interview, the i opts instead to focus on the Labour leader's election campaign launch. Mr Corbyn vowed to transform the UK by tackling tax dodgers, big polluters and other members of the wealthy elite.</figcaption>

        <figcaption>In other election news, the Metro says "Generation X" could cause trouble for the PM. A record 300,000 people registered to vote in 48 hours, with two thirds of them aged under 35. Surveys suggest young people are more likely to back Labour and pro-EU parties, the paper says.</figcaption>

        <figcaption>And as John Bercow winds up his role as Speaker of the House of Commons, the Daily Mirror claims he "demanded" £1m to appear in the next series of I'm a Celebrity...!. A source from the ITV programme told the paper Mr Bercow had "priced himself out of the market".</figcaption>

        <figcaption>President Trump also makes the FT's front page - this time on the topic of impeachment. The US House of Representatives has voted for his impeachment hearings to be held in public, stepping up the pressure on Mr Trump as a "body of public evidence" will be compiled, the paper says.</figcaption>

        <figcaption>Meanwhile, human rights lawyers are seeking compensation from British American Tobacco for more than 350 child labourers and their families, forced by "poverty wages" to work in gruelling conditions in Malawi. The Guardian reports the number of child claimants could rise to 15,000.</figcaption>

        <figcaption>MPs slating ITV for its "failure" over aftercare for guests on the Jeremy Kyle Show is the front-page story for the Sun. A parliamentary inquiry had been launched into reality TV following the death of a man who had taken a lie detector on Mr Kyle's show.</figcaption>

        <figcaption>And a university has banned sombreros from fancy dress parties because wearing one could be considered racist, the Daily Star says. The paper says security guards will be enforcing the ban at nights out at the University of Sheffield.</figcaption>

      <p>Many of the papers consider <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7637239/Vote-Farage-Corbyn-Tories-miss-nearly-90-seats-Brexit-Party-splits-vote.html">what the Daily Mail calls</a> the "diplomatic hand grenade" that was Donald Trump's interview with Nigel Farage on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The Sun is clear that it represented a "thump" for Labour, as Mr Trump's reassurances over the NHS "destroyed Jeremy Corbyn's most powerful attack line".</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2019/10/why-labour-welcomes-donald-trumps-endorsement-boris-johnson">The New Statesman disagrees</a>, saying the Labour leadership are "delighted" with the intervention as it shows one of their main themes is "cutting through". A person described as a "chipper source in Jeremy Corbyn's office" tells the magazine: "I love it... let's have this argument for the whole campaign."</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/unite-brexit-vote-with-farage-pact-trump-urges-boris-johnson-xp7gngj7h">The Times says</a> President Trump "derailed Boris Johnson's first day on the campaign trail" by his criticism of the prime minister's Brexit deal.</p>
      <p>It was "an embarrassing blow" the paper says, part of an interview that "blindsided Downing Street." <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/the-waugh-zone-corbyn-trump-general-election_uk_5dbb3dece4b0bb1ea3773cea?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAACmJq_EPRFSnUW-CHsLBtNUNXuYnP06Mu36ZB9yZcxapRTo9FozWgZ0zt6jd5M5UCEFVx36vJ77YuMpRmF_EqGFv4cFX7yfF5a4DXvU9KFcKWGofdcn3oFFfYLnRto5S_EHvDXZr_wr96LzQSHAv0W6f1eUyqBM5FI9P0pU-j08p">The Huffpost UK</a> draws a similar conclusion that "overall it was a happier Halloween for the Labour leader than it was for his Tory counterpart".</p>

      <p>Five million face masks will be issued to children in Delhi on Friday, <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/delhi-gives-5m-children-smog-masks-t5zd6f8n3">the Times reports</a>, to protect them from smog in what was found to be the world's most polluted city for the second year running.</p>
      <p>The authorities are scrambling to reassure parents as schools re-open after the Diwali break, it says. But many are unimpressed. "Tell me please how masks for children are a solution", one father asks the paper. "It is totally cosmetic and ridiculous."</p>
      <p>The sale at auction of a 2,700-year-old vase has provoked "diplomatic discomfort" in London and "disquiet" in Cyprus, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/31/vase-sold-in-thatcher-auction-was-political-gift-says-ex-cypriot-leader">the Guardian says</a>.</p>

      <p>It's because the pottery in question was an official gift given to Margaret Thatcher in 1988 - yet ended up raising £6,000 at Christie's in May. "We're seeking an explanation as to how protocol could have slipped like this," a Cypriot government source tells the paper.</p>
      <p>John Bercow has just quit the bear-pit of Parliament but plans for him to spend part of his retirement in the jungle have fallen flat, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/john-bercow-ruined-im-celeb-20785404">according to the Daily Mirror</a>.</p>
      <p>It reports he had been in talks to take part in ITV's I'm a Celebrity...! next month - but they broke down over his demand to be paid £1m. His spokeswoman denies the claims, telling the paper there was "no way on earth" he'd go on the show.</p>

      <p>Finally, the front page of the Daily Star features a large sombrero - but, the paper reports, parties at the University of Sheffield may not, after students were told wearing one could be seen as racially offensive to Mexicans.</p>
      <p>It's enough to make you choke on your burrito, <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-news/sheffield-students-union-bans-sombreros-20784140">the paper's editorial says</a> - adding it hopes "sooner or later these idiots will run out of things to get offended about".</p>
