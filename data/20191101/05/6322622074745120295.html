      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 1): The FBM KLCI fell 7.5 points or 0.47% at Bursa Malaysia's afternoon close today amid US-China trade deal uncertainties and after analysts said the benchmark index was in overbought zone.</p>
      <p>"After racking some 3% gains over the past couple of weeks with the key index already at the overbought zone, a retreat is in store. The fresh uncertainties over the Sino-US trade deal may also serve as an excuse for profit taking activities to take precedence," Malacca Securities Sdn Bhd said in a note today.</p>
      <p>At 12:30pm, the KLCI settled down at 1,590.48 on profit taking after closing up 17.98 points or 1.14% at 1,597.98 yesterday.</p>
      <p>Today, volume across Bursa stood at 1.73 billion shares worth RM723.39 million, as KLCI components including Public Bank Bhd and Hong Leong Financial Group Bhd settled among top decliners.</p>
      <p>Malaysian shares had today tracked US stocks' Thursday overnight drop amid US-China trade deal uncertainties.</p>
      <p><i>Reuters </i>reported that US stocks fell on Thursday as conflicting tones surrounding a possible trade deal between the US and China eclipsed strong earnings reports from Apple and Facebook.</p>
      <p>It was reported that mixed signals around trade gave investors reason for caution after a <i>Bloomberg </i>report said Chinese officials have doubts about whether it is possible to reach a comprehensive long-term trade deal with Washington and US President Donald Trump.</p>
      <p>"But Trump later said the two countries would soon announce a site where a 'Phase One' trade deal will be signed after Chile cancelled a planned summit set for mid-November that was to be the venue for a signing," <i>Reuters </i>said.</p>
