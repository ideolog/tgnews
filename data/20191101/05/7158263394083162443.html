      <p>Firefighters in California have spent weeks battling intense wildfires, including the massive Kincade fire. Unfortunately, on Thursday, things took a turn for the worse.</p>
      <p>On Halloween night, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/live-news/fire-in-california-latest-easy-getty-kincade-fires-evacuations-today-live-updates-2019-10-31/">new fires erupted</a>, including <a href="https://twitter.com/VCFD_PIO/status/1190101939666604033">the Maria fire</a>, which has already burned more than 8,000 acres. Power has been cut in some areas to prevent new blazes, more than <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-10-29/la-me-kincade-fire-evacuation-san-francisco">200,000 people have been ordered to evacuate</a>, and Sonoma’s Kincade fire has now burned about <a href="https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/2019/10/23/kincade-fire/">78,000 acres</a> (i.e., twice the size of San Francisco), according to the California Department of Forestry &amp; Fire Protection.</p>
      <p>While California has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/09/climate/why-california-fires.html">always been prone to fires</a> and <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/california-braces-more-fires-blackouts-wind-comes-roaring-back-state-n1073136">thankfully no one has died</a>, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/this-will-only-get-worse-in-the-future-experts-find-direct-line-between-california-wildfires-and-climate-change/">CBS News</a> reports that California fires are only going to get worse and will only continue to devolve because of climate change.</p>

      <p>“This is only the beginning,” former California Gov. Jerry Brown <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/29/weather/california-us-wildfires-climate-change/index.html">told <i>Politico</i> a few days ago</a>. “This is only a taste of the horror and terror that will occur in decades.”</p>
      <p>According to the United States wildfires map, below, from <a href="https://www.esri.com/en-us/home">Ersi</a>, a geographic information system software company based in California, the location of the California wildfires varies but centers heavily northwest of Los Angeles and in northern areas of the state.</p>
      <p>It can be disheartening to watch the destruction from afar, but even if you don’t live anywhere near California, there are things you can do to help wildfire victims. Check out these options and do what you can.</p>
      <h3>Help evacuated people find housing</h3>
