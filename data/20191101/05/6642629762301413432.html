      <p>Rescue workers searched for survivors on Friday after an ambulance helicopter carrying seven people crashed into waters off <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/south-korea.html">South Korea</a>'s eastern coast.</p>
      <p>Rescue official Seong Ho-seon said the helicopter had picked up an injured crab fisherman before it crashed around 11:30pm (local time) on Thursday near the South Korea-controlled islets of Dokdo in waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan.</p>
      <p>South Korea deployed dozens of aircraft and vessels and more than 30 divers to search the area, but no passengers were found as of Friday morning.</p>
      <p>"We presume that the helicopter crashed into sea within two minutes after liftoff (in Dokdo)," Seong said during a televised briefing.</p>
      <p>Yonhap news agency also quoted a South Korean official as saying that the weakening tide had allowed rescuers to expand the search.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon has also reportedly ordered government agencies "to put in full-fledged efforts to rescue survivors and search missing passengers".Â </p>
      <p>The helicopter was planning to transport the injured fisherman to a hospital in the mainland city of Daegu when the incident happened.</p>
      <p>According to Yonhap, the missing helicopter was manufactured by France-based Airbus Helicopters, formerly Eurocopter Group, that can carry up to 28 passengers and fly at 250km (155 miles) per hour for five hours.</p>
      <p>The Dokdo islets, called Takeshima in Japanese, are a subject of territorial disputes between the countries.</p>
