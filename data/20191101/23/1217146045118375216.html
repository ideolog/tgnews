      <p>Microsoft says that Windows 10, version 1903 is affected by a new bug triggering an error asking users to "Try again" after completing the Windows installation process or after resetting a device.</p>
      <p>"After successfully completing the Out-of-box Experience (OOBE) to setup a new Windows device or after resetting a device, once you reach the Desktop you might see a screen with black bars at the top and bottom with blue in the middle and receive the error, 'Something went wrong but you can try again. MSA' with a Try again button," says Microsoft in a newly published support document.</p>
      <h3>Fix arriving in an upcoming release</h3>
      <p>The issue affects devices that connect to the Internet for the first time or the ones on which new Windows installs haven't previously connected during OOBE.</p>
      <p>OOBE represents the Windows installation process and it consists of a series of screens asking the user to the OS license agreement, to connect to the internet, as well as log in with or sign up for a Microsoft Account, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/customize/desktop/customize-oobe#oobe-flow">among others</a>.</p>
      <p>"During OOBE, you have the option to connect to the internet but are not required to do so," <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/4529830/something-went-wrong-but-you-can-try-again-msa">adds</a> Microsoft.</p>
      <p>"You might receive this error the first time you connect to the internet on a new device or new install of Windows that has not previously connected to the internet during the Out-of-box Experience (OOBE)."</p>
      <p>The company is working on a resolution for this new issue and it plans to provide an update in a future Windows 10, version 1903 release.</p>
      <h3>Workaround available</h3>
      <p>Microsoft provides detailed procedures that can be followed to prevent the "Something went wrong but you can try again. MSA" error from appearing during the Windows installation,</p>
      <p>Users who have work open that they don't want to lose have to follow these steps:</p>
      <p>1. Select Ctrl+Shift+F10 on the keyboard once.<br/>2. Select Ctrl+Shift+Esc on the keyboard to open Task Manager. If you do not see Task Manager open, repeat step 1.<br/>3. If you do not see the Details tab, select More Details in the lower left.<br/>4. Select the Details tab.<br/>5. Find the wwahost.exe process. Right-click or long-press on that process and select End task from the context menu.</p>
      <p>For all other cases, restarting the Windows device should be enough:</p>
      <p>1. Select Ctrl+Alt+Delete on the keyboard.<br/>2. In the lower right corner of the screen, select the Power button.<br/>3. Select Restart.</p>
      <h3>Recently found Windows issues</h3>
      <p>This week Microsoft also issued a workaround designed to mitigate an <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-issues-workaround-for-windows-10-user-creation-ime-bug/">issue preventing Windows 10 customers from creating local users</a> while setting up a new Windows device using Input Method Editor (IME) for Chinese, Japanese, or Korean languages.</p>
      <p>Microsoft acknowledged another new known issue impacting several Windows versions and leading to <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-warns-of-windows-slow-startup-due-to-persistent-memory/">slow startups on devices configured to use persistent memory</a>. </p>
      <p>This bug impacts both client and server Windows versions but does not affect home users since they don't use the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/storage/storage-spaces/deploy-pmem">persistent memory</a> feature available on servers and workstations.</p>
