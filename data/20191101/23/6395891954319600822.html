      <p><b>ARCADIA, Calif.Â (AP)</b> - Storm the Court won the $2 million Juvenile by a neck at 45-1 odds on opening day of the Breeders' Cup on Friday, scoring the biggest upset in the race's 35-year history.</p>
      <p>Nine of the day's 10 races - led by five Cup races for 2-year-olds - went off safely at Santa Anita, where 36 horses have died since December.</p>
      <p>Ridden by Flavien Prat, Storm the Court paid $93.80 to win. He ran 1 1/16 miles in 1:44.93. The victory put the colt trained by Peter Eurton into the conversation as the winter favorite for next year's Kentucky Derby.</p>
      <p>Racing resumes Saturday with nine Cup races, topped by the $6 million Classic airing in prime time on NBC.</p>
      <p>Not since Vale of York won the 2009 Juvenile at 30-1 odds, paying $63.20, had there been a bigger upset in the Juvenile.</p>
      <p>Storm the Court followed in his sire's hoof prints.</p>
      <p>Court Vision was a 64-1 shot when he stunned Goldikova to win the BC Mile in 2011, paying $131.60 - third-highest in Cup history.</p>
      <p>Storm the Court edged Anneau d'Or. Wrecking Crew was third.</p>
      <p>Dennis' Moment, the 4-5 favorite, stumbled out of the starting gate and trailed the field. He finished last.</p>
      <p>Eight Rings, trained by Bob Baffert, was sixth.</p>
      <p>European horses were shut out on Future Stars Friday, when five different jockeys and trainers won. Brothers Irad Ortiz Jr. and Jose Ortiz each earned victories.</p>
