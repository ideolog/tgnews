      <p>PHNOM PENH: A 21-year-old British tourist whose body was found floating in the sea off the Cambodian coast accidentally drowned, an official said Friday (Nov 1), ruling out foul play after <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/amelia-bambridge-missing-british-tourist-cambodia-body-found-12051730">a days-long search</a> grabbed international headlines.</p>
      <p>Backpacker Amelia Bambridge mysteriously disappeared in southern Cambodia on Oct 24 after a late-night beach party on the island of Koh Rong.</p>

      <p>She did not check out from her hostel, and soon her relatives and more than 100 members of the security forces were scouring the nearby jungle and sea.</p>

      <p>Police finally located her body on Thursday some 70km away near the Thai border, but the case was ruled an accident.</p>
      <p>"She died from drowning," Kheang Phearum, spokesman for the Preah Sihanouk provincial administration, told AFP.</p>
      <p>"There is no sign of a criminal offence. The body has been given to her family."</p>
      <p>A two-hour ferry ride from the boom town of Sihanoukville, Koh Rong is popular with backpackers for its cheap guesthouses, beachside bars and idyllic sunsets.</p>
      <p>The Southeast Asian country's economy relies heavily on tourism and is generally considered safe for travellers.</p>
      <p>But crimes involving foreigners have occasionally grabbed headlines.</p>
      <p>Last month a Cambodian court charged three men with gang-raping a French tourist in the coastal province of Kampot after offering her a ride in their car.</p>
