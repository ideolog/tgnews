      <p>With the start of November comes the beginning of three months of free weekday parking at White Rock’s waterfront.</p>
      <p>Through Jan. 31, 2020, there is no charge to park anytime from Monday to Friday – and a message on the parking meters is quick to remind those who try to pay for a spot.</p>
      <p>“Enjoy our City By the Sea! 🙂 Have a Great Day! :)” reads text that pops onto the screen.</p>
      <p>White Rock council gave the thumbs-up to the idea in July, and to new parking rates for ‘high-demand’ and ‘value rate’ zones ($3.75 and $3.25 per hour, respectively).</p>
