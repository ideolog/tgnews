      <p>And although excitement surrounding the rematch continues to grow after the first meeting between the pair amassed over one million pay-per-view buys, Taylor admitted she is sceptical of the clash.</p>

      <p>"It's all about business, I understand that. I'm just interested in the purity of the sport, I love fighters going toe-to-toe together.</p>
      <p>"This is our lives, it's something we've been working towards since we were 10 or 11 years of age. We've had amateur competitions, we've stood in the dressing room not knowing who we were going to fight in these competitions.</p>
      <p>"We've put our bodies on the line week in, week out for years and years now. I love the fight game, I love the purity of the sport. There's something very noble about going into the trenches against your opponent.</p>
      <p>"I just love that side of the sport, I don't like the other side of it."</p>
