      <h1>Voice of the Mirror: Cruel hospital car park fees represent Tory broken promises</h1>
      <h2>Nurses should not have to break off from their shift to feed a meter, nor patients and families with enough to deal with be burdened with extra worry about a fine</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T23:09:44+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 23:09</time> by <a rel="author">Mirror.co.uk</a></address>
      <p>Five years ago the Conservatives pledged to reform hospital car parking charges. It proved yet another broken promise.</p>
      <p>Patients, families and NHS staff are still enduring the stress and inconvenience of paying to park at a hospital.</p>
      <p>Figures show firms operating the car parks raked in £272million last year – up from £226million in 2017. Scandalously, £86million of this came from the pockets of NHS workers.</p>
      <p>And what’s more – some 169 trusts charge disabled blue badge holders to park.</p>
      <p>This is a stealth tax on the sick and those who care for them.</p>

      <p>Nurses should not have to break off from their shift to feed a meter, nor patients and families with enough to deal with be burdened with extra worry about a fine.</p>
      <p>NHS trusts continue to hike the parking fees because they have been starved of cash by this Tory government.</p>
      <p>If we had a properly funded health service they would not have to resort to finding other sources of revenue.</p>
      <p>The Tories cannot be trusted to keep their word and they cannot be trusted on the NHS.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>The Brexit Party leader likes to present himself as the man of the people standing up against the establishment</p>
      <p>In reality Nigel Farage is a privately educated former stockbroker touting a nasty and dangerous right-wing agenda – he’s spoken at rallies for far right parties in Europe, dismissed climate change as a “scam” and backed the privatisation of the NHS.</p>
      <p>He is hell-bent on pushing for a no-deal Brexit that will put countless people out of work and cause economic carnage.</p>
      <p>The fact this cut-price Donald Trump wants to form an alliance with the Tories speaks volumes about both parties.</p>
      <h3>Good sports at World up final</h3>

      <p>Whatever the result of the Rugby World Cup, England have done themselves and their country proud.</p>
      <p>Throughout the tournament they’ve proved where there’s a ruck, there’s class.</p>
