      <h1>And Now for Some Very Good Bears</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T23:00:26+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 23:00</time> by <a rel="author">Catie Keck</a></address>
      <p>You ever look around and notice that bears are notably absent from your newsfeed? That there are neither <a href="https://earther.gizmodo.com/rejoice-the-great-fat-bear-competition-has-begun-1829504844">fat bears</a> nor <a href="https://deadspin.com/bear-breaks-into-montana-home-takes-nap-on-shelf-1835762067">bears doing crimes</a> anywhere to be found? Reader, there is a clear scarcity of bear blogs, and for that reason, I think it only fair we point you in the right direction.</p>
      <p>Just a <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/10/fat-bear-week-is-back/">few weeks ago</a>, Katmai National Park in the US state of Alaska returned to bring us its beloved fat bear competition – a bracket-style competition for bear gluttony voted on by the park’s social media following. (These bears, after all, must pack on the pounds before hunkering down for a cold and brutal winter.) This year, a bear named Holly was dubbed “Queen of Corpulence” and therefore <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/10/bow-down-to-holly-your-fat-bear-week-champion-of-2019/">fattest bear of them all</a>.</p>
      <p>But while fat bear week has come and gone, the bears captured by Explore’s brown bear cams can be enjoyed year-round. If I may, please enjoy some very good bear cubs:</p>
