      <p>Kilwinning Rangers boss Chris Strain reckons Saturday’s top of the table clash against Pollok is a free hit for his league leaders.</p>
      <p>Buffs head to Newlandsfield in a hastily arranged fixture knowing a win will send them five points clear of second-placed Lok with a game in hand.</p>
      <p>But Strain insists all the pressure is on the Glasgow giants to get a result – because his target this season is simply to stay in the top flight.</p>
      <p>Strain said: “When you compare the budgets of the two teams, Pollok should be looking to win. They have the best resources by a mile and this is a far more important game for them than us.</p>
      <p>“I’m seeing it very much as a free hit. We’re sitting top at the moment and that’s nice from a vanity point of view, but all we are focusing on is reaching the 30-point barrier which is normally enough to keep you in the division. Our chairman has made it clear that finishing in the top half would be be a success for us this season.</p>

      <p>“We’re only three points off 30 at the moment which is remarkable and testament to the efforts the players are putting in.</p>
      <p>“Nobody expected us to be in this position so we won’t get too up or down no matter the result.”</p>
      <p>Pollok won 3-0 when the sides met at Buffs Park in September.</p>
      <p>Strain added: “To be honest, it’s a game we could without because there’s a bit of a virus going around the club and a few players nursing knocks and bruises.</p>
      <p>“But the players will certainly feel they have a point to prove after losing last time round. It was definitely a bad day at the office but I’ll have them well up for it on Saturday that’s for sure.”</p>
