      <p>The Durban University of Technology (DUT) is set to establish a commission of inquiry into the death of student Mlungisi Madonsela who was killed during clashes with security guards in February this year.</p>
      <p>He was shot during an altercation with the security guards at one of the university's campuses and died in hospital.</p>
      <p>On Friday, <a href="https://www.timeslive.co.za/news/south-africa/2019-11-01-dut-establishes-inquiry-into-the-death-of-student-mlungisi-madonsela/">TimesLive </a>reported the inquiry would be chaired by the former deputy president of the Supreme Court of Appeal, Justice Khayelihle Mthiyane.</p>
      <p>Part of the inquiry is to look into the events that led to Madonsela's death as well as a staff member who was injured at the time.</p>
      <p>Two security guards were suspended following his death, <a href="https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/watch-dut-protesters-demand-justice-for-slain-fellow-student-mlungisi-madonsela-20190218">News24 </a>reported.</p>
      <p>At the time, the university said the guards were suspended by their security company, which was contracted by the university, pending the outcome of an investigation.</p>
      <p>Madonsela's death led to a total shutdown at the university. However, teaching and learning later resumed after engagements between university management and student representatives.</p>
