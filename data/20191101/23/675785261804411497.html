      <h1>Molly-Mae Hague slammed for 'cultural appropriation' over Cleopatra Halloween costume</h1>
      <h2>Molly-Mae's Cleopatra costume has drawn criticism from followers who branded it "cultural appropriation"</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T23:43:42+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 23:43</time> by <a rel="author">Verity Sulway, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/verity-sulway/</a></address>
      <p>Love Island star <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/molly-mae-hague">Molly-Mae Hague</a> has come under fire for dressing up as Egyptian ruler Cleopatra for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/halloween">Halloween</a> .</p>
      <p>Her costume included traditional clothing for Egyptian monarchy, with a gold headdress and she held an Ankh in her hand.</p>
      <p>This has drawn criticism for being cultural appropriation, which is when someone adopts aspects of a minority or disadvantaged culture that is not their own, for personal gain.</p>
      <p>When Molly-Mae, who is not Egyptian, posted a photo in her costume last night, comments flooded in berating her for it.</p>
      <p>"Love the look but this is cultural appropriation" said one.</p>

      <p>"Cultures arenâ€™t costumes :(" said another.</p>
      <p>"My culture is not your Halloween costume", said a third.</p>
      <p>"Cultural appropriation for Halloween at its finest" added another.</p>
      <p>"Molly please don't culturally appropriate. You are not egyptian", begged another.</p>

      <p>"Yes, this is cultural appropriation, you are not Egyptian and therefore have no right to use their culture for your own purposes, how very wrong of you", said another comment.</p>
      <p>However, Molly-Mae also received thousands of positive comments on the post, and some fans expressed disappointment at that.</p>
      <p>Model Demi Rose Mawby was slammed for the same thing earlier this year when she dressed as Cleopatra for her 24th birthday party.</p>

      <p>Molly-Mae appeared at the Pride of Britain Awards earlier this week, where she talked about the accusations her relationship was fake.</p>
      <p>She said: "I think we're proper over that now. I don't think anyone is saying that anymore.</p>
      <p>"We're just happy to be here."</p>

      <p>Tommy also echoed his girlfriend's sentiments that things were going well with their relationship.</p>
      <p>The boxer gushed the couple were stronger than ever since making their new home in Manchester a lovenest.</p>
      <p>"We've gone from strength to strength since moving in," he said.</p>
