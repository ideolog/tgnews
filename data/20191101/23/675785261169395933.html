      <h2>Jealous Dr Ali ignored Emma's agonising pain while clashing with Gary - but she nearly died from a ruptured appendix</h2>

      <p>Furious Coronation Street fans want Dr Ali Neeson axed after Emma Brooker almost died.</p>
      <p>Emma came into work late in agonising pain, but Maria Connor suggested it was just the dodgy kebab and a hangover.</p>
      <p>Dr Ali came into the barbers to give his diagnosis - and felt threatened when he saw Gary Windass about to go on a date with his ex.</p>
      <p>The jealous doctor didn't examine poor Emma, who covered up her pain then grimaced in agony when she was left alone.</p>
      <p>When Gary and Maria came back from the pub they spotted lifeless Emma lying unconscious on the floor.</p>

      <p>Steve McDonald was horrified when he came out of The Rovers and saw Emma being taken into an ambulance.</p>
      <p>At the hospital, Steve was told Emma had a ruptured appendix and needed an emergency operation to save her life.</p>
      <p>Furious Steve lashed out when he discovered Ali had told Emma she had food poisoning.</p>

      <p>He yelled at Ali: "My daughter could have died because of you. You should have known. Its' your job to know."</p>
      <p>Angry Steve then grabbed "negligent" Ali and shoved him up against the wall in a moment of rage.</p>
      <p>He shouted: "This isn’t over. You're not fit to be a doctor. I’m gonna make sure you’re struck off as a doctor and taking you to court for all you’ve got in case you nearly kill someone else's kid."</p>

      <p>Corrie viewers flocked to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> to blast Dr</p>
      <p>"Ali should be struck of! a doctor acting with incompetence! he's a liability and has proved that time and time again," said one viewer.</p>
      <p>Another added: "Maybe he need that as he is not fit under the influence of drugs"</p>
      <p>"WHAT! Operate straight away. Not Emma. Nooooooo. Quick, I need the number for CQC. I'm whistleblowing, Ali," said a third.</p>

      <p>However, the good doctor did have some fans that claimed he was not to blame.</p>
      <p>One viewer said: "Ummm Steve, for one Ali wasn't in shift working, two Maria rang him and asked to check on Emma, three Emma &amp; Maria told Ali that she had been drinking and had a kebab, four if she was that much in pain she could of gone to A&amp;E"</p>
      <p>"He wasn’t on duty and I wouldn’t call that an examination either. Surely he can’t be struck off for that," added another.</p>
      <p>A third said: "Surely if Ali is off duty he he isn't responsible? He was in a difficult situation with Gary trying to be a hardman"</p>
