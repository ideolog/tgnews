      <p>Blame for the murder of a boy aged five lies partly with the Government for its failed attempt to privatise probation services, an official report has warned.</p>
      <p>Alex Malcolm was beaten to death by his mother’s boyfriend Marvyn Iheanacho, 41, who had been released on licence from prison six months before for assaulting five exes.</p>
      <p>An inquest jury last month found a series of errors due to disastrous probation privatisation “contributed to the death”.</p>
      <p>Coroner Andrew Harris yesterday said increased workloads and understaffing, plus shortages of approved hostel places for ex-cons, were factors.</p>

      <p>He demanded the Government make changes to probation services within 56 days, warning: “There is still a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken.”</p>
      <p>Alex died when Iheanacho attacked him after he lost a trainer in a park in Catford, South East London, in 2016. The murderer got at least 21 years.</p>
      <p>Calling for action, Dr Harris, coroner in Southwark, South London, told the Government: “Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action.”</p>
      <p>Alex’s mum Liliya Breha, 32, of Bromley, Kent, said: “The government should definitely take responsibility.”</p>

      <p>Privatisation reforms under Chris Grayling cost almost £500million, yet killings by ex-inmates on parole increased 63%. All probation work is now being renationalised.</p>
      <p>Harry Fletcher, of the Victims’ Rights Campaign, said: “The government’s own assessment in 2013 warned the probation changes would be very high risk – but they went ahead anyway.”</p>
      <p>A Ministry of Justice spokeswoman said: “The National Probation Service in London has undertaken a huge programme of work to improve standards and better protect the public.”</p>
