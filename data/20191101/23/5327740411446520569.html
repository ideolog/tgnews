      <p>Light winds and high concentrations of fine particulate matter has prompted Metro Vancouver to issue an Air Quality Bulletin for Metro Vancouver and the central Fraser Valley.</p>
      <p>The stagnant weather pattern is expected to continue throughout the weekend, creating a build up of dust and smoke during the evening and overnight.</p>
      <p>The air quality is currently listed as “fair.” However that could change, Metro Vancouver said in a statement released Friday afternoon.</p>
      <p>Bulletins are issued when pollution levels are not yet at a point that warrants an Air Quality Advisory. The warnings are aimed at encouraging emission reductions, and informing residents who might be sensitive to changing air quality.</p>
      <p>Fall and winter weather conditions often create weather patterns that hold pollutants like smoke and exhaust in the airshed.</p>
      <p>Metro Vancouver is asking residents minimize wood burning activities and the use of fireworks until weather conditions improve.</p>
      <p>Persons with chronic underlying medical conditions are also being told to consider postponing strenuous exercise until the bulletin is lifted.</p>
      <p>The bulletin is expected to remain in place until the weather pattern changes.</p>
