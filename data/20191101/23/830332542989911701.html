      <p>RACINE, Wis. - Packers outside linebacker Za'Darius Smith has been cited for marijuana possession.</p>
      <p>According to court records, Smith was also driving 20-24 mph over the speed limit last month.</p>
      <p>The Journal Sentinel reports that the citations stem from a Sept. 29 traffic stop while Smith and two other teammates were returning to Green Bay from a trip to Chicago.</p>
      <p>The Racine County Sheriff's Office says the 27-year-old Smith was pulled over after deputies clocked him going 81 mph in a 60 mph construction zone.</p>
      <p>No drugs were found on any of the players, but a search found three hollowed-out cigars filled with marijuana and a vaping cartridge inside a duffel back in the rear of the SUV. Smith was the only one cited.</p>
      <p>Racine County officials filed a complaint Oct. 21 for Smith's speeding citation, and the citation for marijuana possession was filed Oct. 30.</p>
      <p>Packers officials say they are aware of the situation and declined to comment further.</p>
      <p>Smith's initial court appearance has been scheduled for Thursday at 2 p.m.</p>
