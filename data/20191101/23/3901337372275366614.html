      <p><b>Result:</b> Dijon FCO 2-1 Paris Saint Germain</p>

      <p>Paris Saint Germain endured a frustrating evening in Ligue 1 after falling to a 2-1 defeat to struggling Dijon FCO at the Stade Gaston Gerard on Friday evening.</p>
      <p>Pascal Kimpembe’s return allowed Marquinhos to slot back alongside him in defence while Idrissa Gueye who sat out the 4-0 thrashing of Olympique Marseille returned.</p>
      <p>The bright start after four minutes surprisingly came from Dijon, but Keylor Navas went down to the left to parry Julio Tavares effort from 25 yards out.</p>
      <p>PSG hit the front though on 19 minutes when Angel Di Maria released Kylian Mbappe, who held composure to flick over an onrushing Alfred Gomis and into the net.</p>
      <p>Romain Amalfitano filled up for Senou Coulibaly a minute before the half-hour mark, as Dijon restricted their defensive set-up.</p>
      <p>In exactly four minutes, Fouad Chafik made way for Hamza Mendyl at wingback in the home side’s second change within the matter of minutes.</p>
      <p>Dijon pulled level in the last minute of the half following a low ball into the area from Ibrahim Ndong, which Navas palmed into the path of Mounir Chouiar to fire home.</p>
      <p>The bottom-placed side had a spring in their step following halftime, and went ahead two minutes in through Jhonder Cadiz who bypassed several challenges to slot through Navas.</p>
      <p>Mauro Icardi played a telling one-two with Mbappe on the edge of the area nine minutes later, however the on-loan Inter Milan failed to beat Gomis despite a solid attempt.</p>
      <p>PSG knocked on the door all the more on 64 minutes with Mbappe working his way into the area to get onto a cross, but the Frenchman headed off the crossbar in the end.</p>
      <p>The woodwork prevented PSG for the second time five minutes later after Leonardo Paredes fired in a shot from the area after controlling a high ball from a corner kick.</p>
      <p>PSG kept throwing all their gauntlet in the final minutes, but the home side stayed strong to collect their third win of the season.</p>
