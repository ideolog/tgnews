      <p>Regina police publicly confirmed Friday that a body found northeast of Regina is indeed missing Regina woman Jenaya Wapemoose.</p>
      <p>Officers located human remains in an area northeast of Regina on Oct. 26. A news release issued Monday morning said police had notified the Wapemoose family of the discovery, but that the identity of the deceased person had not yet been definitively confirmed.</p>
      <p>On Friday police said confirmation of Wapemoose’s identity was completed this week with the help of the Saskatchewan Coroner’s Service, and that the victim’s family has been notified.</p>
      <p><a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/crime/man-charged-with-murder-in-death-of-missing-woman-jenaya-wapemoose">Two people have been charged in connection with Wapemoose’s death.</a> Eric Kakakaway, a 23-year-old man from Regina, has been charged with second-degree murder and committing an indignity to a body. Jeanette Kakakaway, 30, is charged with accessory after the fact to murder in addition to outstanding, unrelated breach warrants.</p>
      <p>Eric made his first appearance on these charges in Regina Provincial Court Monday morning. The charges were adjourned and he is due back in court Nov. 4. Jeanette’s charges were also adjourned to Nov. 4. Both remain in custody.</p>
      <p>Wapemoose <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/local-news/search-continuing-for-cowessess-first-nation-woman-missing-since-march">was last seen on the 1800 block of Ottawa Street on March 10 and was last active on social media April 7.</a> The Regina Police Service said she was reported missing May 7. <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/local-news/regina-woman-still-missing-despite-extensive-police-investigation">On June 27, RPS said the case was being considered suspicious based on evidence gathered during an “extensive investigation.”</a></p>
      <p>According to information on the charges presented in court, she was allegedly killed on April 7.</p>
      <p>Last weekend and early Monday morning, friends of Wapemoose were posting memories and condolences to Facebook, indicating her body had been located.</p>
      <p>Regina Police Service Chief Evan Bray briefly addressed the media Monday. Without revealing details of the investigation, Bray said it’s believed Wapemoose was known to the accused and that police believe the two Kakakaways are related, but didn’t say how.</p>
