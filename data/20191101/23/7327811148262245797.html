      <p>TEANECK, New Jersey -- A Maryland man involved <a href="https://abc7ny.com/traffic/father-and-4-daughters-killed-in-delaware-crash-identified/3718921/">in a Delaware collision </a>that killed five members of a New Jersey family has been sentenced to one year of probation.</p>
      <p>Alvin Hubbard III of Cambridge was sentenced Friday. He pleaded guilty in June to five misdemeanor counts of operating a motor vehicle causing death and two misdemeanor counts of vehicular assault.</p>
      <p>The judge gave the 46-year-old Hubbard the maximum combined sentence of 14 years but suspended the prison time for a year of probation. Prosecutors sought a six-month sentence.</p>
      <p>Hubbard was initially charged with five counts of second-degree vehicular homicide, three counts of vehicular assault and other offenses.</p>
      <p>Authorities said Hubbard operated his pickup truck in a criminally negligent manner when it crossed the median and was hit by the family's minivan in July 2018. A father and his four daughters died.</p>
