      <p>A search for a couple in southeastern British Columbia has ended with the pair found safe after being stranded for days in a remote area of the Rocky Mountains.</p>
      <p>RCMP Cpl. Jesse O’Donaghey says the search began after 22-year-old Catherine Gibbons was reported missing Wednesday, five days after she had last spoken to friends or family.</p>
      <p>Investigators also confirmed Damon Brodeur, who is 24, was with her and the two were likely camping in the backcountry.</p>
      <p>An aerial search Thursday spotted Gibbons’s car stuck in an ice-filled creek along a forest service road northeast of Cranbrook.</p>
      <p>O’Donaghey says the couple — both Columbia Valley residents — helped rescuers by stretching out an orange tarp and stamping a large arrow and the word “help” in the snow, leading crews to a nearby cabin where they had taken shelter for nearly a week.</p>
      <p>Gibbons, Brodeur and their dog were airlifted to safety and given a precautionary medical check but O’Donaghey says all three are well and in good spirits.</p>
