      <p>WATERBURY, Connecticut -- Police in Connecticut have arrested a man after trick-or-treaters reported finding razor blades in their candy bags.</p>
      <p>Waterbury police say 37-year-old Jason Racz faces charges including first-degree reckless endangerment and risk of injury to a minor.</p>
      <p>Police started investigating Thursday night after children reported finding razor blades in their candy containers. Chief Fernando Spagnola says no blades were found embedded in the candy, just loose.</p>
      <p>He says no injuries were reported as a result of the razor blades.</p>
      <p>The chief says when officers questioned Racz, he said the blades accidentally spilled into the candy bowl he used to hand out treats.</p>
      <p>Police urged parents to check their children's candy.</p>
      <p>Racz is being held on $250,000 bail pending arraignment Friday. It could not be determined if he has a lawyer.</p>
