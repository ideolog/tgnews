      <p>REUTERS: Liverpool manager Juergen Klopp believes soccer's governing bodies are ignoring player welfare as the Merseyside club prepare for a congested fixture list in December.</p>
      <p>Having qualified for the League Cup quarter-final in midweek, Liverpool are scheduled to play nine matches across four competitions next month.</p>

      <p>"The likes of (Sadio) Mane, (Mohamed) Salah, (Jordan) Henderson - they have two weeks off a year, with a physically demanding job, with pressure as well on every game," Klopp told a news conference on Friday.</p>
      <p>"The situation is clear, the solutions are possible but FIFA, UEFA and the leagues have to sit at a table and discuss it and think about the players rather than their wallet."</p>
      <p>The Premier League leaders have been drawn to play away at Aston Villa in the League Cup quarter-final in the week of Dec. 16 - the week that Klopp's side travel to Qatar for the FIFA Club World Cup.</p>
      <p>Klopp has already said that, if the fixture cannot be rearranged, Liverpool may not be able to play in the League Cup - having progressed thanks to a penalty shootout following a thrilling 5-5 draw against Arsenal. Talks are continuing with the English Football League to identify an alternative date.</p>
      <p>"There is no final decision yet," the German told a news conference on Friday.</p>
      <p>"If we would play while we're in Qatar, then we would need two different teams - but we cannot leave any players at home for the Carabao Cup (League Cup)."</p>
      <p>Klopp said it was "absolutely obvious" that English clubs were being forced to play too many games.</p>
      <p>"If I create headlines, then people will say 'Why is he moaning?' That is what I don't like," he added. "It is obvious that it is too much.</p>
      <p>"Carabao Cup - a nice competition obviously. What a wonderful game we had on Wednesday night - but then, still, at the end of January, there are two semi-finals (legs).</p>
      <p>"England is the only country where nobody really wants to touch (fixture congestion) - or maybe they want to, but don't discuss it."</p>
      <p>Liverpool, currently six points clear at the top of the Premier League, visit Aston Villa in the league on Saturday.</p>
