      <p>"Jeopardy!" host <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/alex-trebek">Alex Trebek</a> joined "Wheel of Fortune" hosts <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/pat-sajak-wheel-of-fortune-stalwart-breaks-game-show-hosting-record">Pat Sajak</a> and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/vanna-white-wheel-of-fortune-fans-faith-tragedy">Vanna White</a> on the Hollywood Walk of Fame Friday to celebrate the unveiling of a star honoring producer Harry Friedman.</p>
      <p>"I hosted my first television quiz show in 1964 and over the past 55 years there have been many other game shows and quiz shows that I have had the pleasure of hosting," Trebek said, according to <a href="https://variety.com/2019/tv/features/jeopardy-wheel-of-fortune-harry-friedman-walk-of-fame-interview-1203384328/">Variety</a>.</p>

      <p>He continued: "It has also been my honor to work with some of the brightest minds in television daytime: Mark Goodson, Merrill Heater, and I would put Harry Friedman in that company as well. He's always pushing the envelope, he's very imaginative, he works hard to stay ahead of the game."</p>
      <p>Friedman first became a producer for "Fortune" in 1995, then took the same role on "Jeopardy!" in 1997. He has been an executive producer on both shows since 1999.</p>

      <p>"To me when you are working in this industry when you have the professional relationship and the personal relationship also, it doesn't get much better than that," Trebek concluded. "So I am delighted to be with all of you today who share with you our good wishes to a man who deserves it, Harry Friedman, thank you."</p>

      <p>"I wish I had known sooner that the persistent stomach pain I experienced prior to my diagnosis was a symptom of pancreatic cancer,” he said in the minute-long video. “Other common symptoms can include mid-back pain, unexplained weight loss, new on-set diabetes and the yellowing of the skin or eyes.”</p>
      <p>Trebek also recently <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/jeopardy-alex-trebek-cancer-end-show-possibility">said that his battle with pancreatic cancer</a> could lead to him leaving "Jeopardy!" which he has hosted since 1984.</p>
