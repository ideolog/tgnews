      <p>Last week, members of the United Auto Workers ratified a new four-year labor deal, ending the strike that began on Sept. 16 over higher pay, greater job security, a bigger share of profit and protection of healthcare benefits.</p>
      <p>Below are companies impacted by the strike:</p>
      <h3>AMERICAN AXLE &amp; MANUFACTURING HOLDINGS INC</h3>
      <p>The driveline and drivetrain systems maker said the strike reduced third-quarter sales by $57 million and also warned of an about $250 million hit to full-year revenue, prompting the company to lower its 2019 forecast.</p>
      <h3>APTIV PLC</h3>
      <p>The auto parts maker said the strike wiped off $70 million from the company’s revenue and reduced profit by 10 cents per share in the third quarter.</p>
      <p>The company’s full-year forecast includes an estimated $250 million impact from the GM strike.</p>
      <h3>TENNECO INC</h3>
      <p>The auto parts maker expects the strike to have a negative impact of about $35 million on fourth-quarter EBITDA.</p>
      <h3>AK STEEL HOLDING CORP</h3>
      <p>The company cut its forecast for full-year earnings and flat-rolled steel shipments, citing the strike.</p>
      <p>It predicted a reduction of flat-rolled steel shipments to between 5.3 and 5.4 million tons for the full year, citing the strike.</p>
      <h3>KAISER ALUMINUM CORP</h3>
      <p>The company said it had lower-than-expected automotive shipments in the third quarter, partly due to the GM strike, and flagged a potential $3 million to $6 million EBITDA impact.</p>
      <h3>PULTEGROUP INC</h3>
      <p>The U.S. homebuilder said it saw an impact on demand in many of Midwest markets from the lengthy labor dispute.</p>
      <h3>GENTEX CORP</h3>
      <p>The automatic-dimming rearview mirror maker said the GM strike hit third-quarter net sales by about 2%.</p>
      <p>Gentex also lowered its full-year sales forecast, and said it expects about $7 million to $8 million in lost sales per week of the strike.</p>
      <h3>PAM TRANSPORTATION SERVICES</h3>
      <p>The U.S. truckload services provider said the GM-UAW strike impacted its quarterly earnings.</p>
      <h3>LINAMAR CORP</h3>
      <p>The Canadian auto parts maker said it estimated a profit impact of up to C$1 million ($761,035) per day due to a fall in orders from General Motors.</p>
