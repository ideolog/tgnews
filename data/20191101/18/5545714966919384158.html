      <p><i>Today's contest features a Blu-ray copy of </i>The Lion King<i> -- come win it!</i></p>
      <p>The original <i>Lion King</i> is definitely one of those big, epic animated films that really dominated the early part of my childhood. I of course loved Disney movies back then, but man the detail in the animation, the songs, the plot -- it all came together perfectly to make this really amazing movie that I can still watch to this day.</p>
      <p>Disney's been trying to recreate the magic lately with semi live action remakes of old hand-animated movies. <i>Beauty and the Beast</i>, <i>Aladdin</i>, and <i>Dumbo</i> all had their shot -- now it's Simba's turn!</p>

      <p>I'm not going to waste a ton of time pasting in press info or talking about the movie too much. Unless you just woke up from a very long coma and are now a caveman lawyer, you probably know all about The Lion King. Simba is, like, The Lion Prince and his The Lion Uncle is super jelly about that, so he The Lion Murders The Lion King and vanishes The Lion Prince to The Lion Wilderness. From there, The Lion Prince meets some pals and embarks on The Lion Journey to claim The Lion Throne as The Lion King.</p>
      <p>It's pretty good! And now that it's all new and stuff, you don't have to feel like your grandpa watching stuff from the '90s that didn't even have big, fancy computer animation. Suck it, '90s!</p>
      <p>To enter to win your copy, use the widget below to leave your name and email address. You can enter daily. For bonus entries, follow Dtoid and Flixist on Twitter and share our contest post with your friends.</p>
