      <p>BlizzCon 2019 brought a host of announcements for Blizzard games, including the long-running fantasy MMO <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/world-of-warcraft/2735"><i>World of Warcraft</i></a>. Blizzard showed off a CGI cinematic for the next expansion, <i>Shadowlands</i>, and we got to see Bolvar Fordragon take center stage ... along with Sylvanas Windrunner.</p>

      <p>The <i>World of Warcraft</i> lore has been hinting that we would be heading to the Shadowlands for quite some time now. A <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/10/28/20937033/blizzard-world-of-warcraft-shadowlands-expansion-bolvar-leak">recent leak from the Blizzard Gear store</a> lent further credibility to the speculation, but there was lots of in-game evidence as well. The former Horde Warchief Vol’jin is in a state between life and death, and there <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/10/22/18008182/world-of-warcraft-vol-jin-battle-for-azeroth-patch-8-1">was a long questline investigating who whispered in his ear</a> as he died. Sylvanas Windrunner, his successor, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/12/4/18108149/world-of-warcraft-battle-for-azeroth-undeath-sylvanas-plot-patch-8-1">was also very interested in death</a>. Bolvar’s been very active — and up to no good — since <i>Legion</i>, so it’ll be interesting to see how this shakes out.</p>

      <p>Now, it looks like Sylvanas is in her end game. She has destroyed the Lich King’s helmet and entered a portal to the Shadowlands, which is full of “fallen warriors”. Some of them are beautiful, others look terrifying and goth.</p>
      <p><i>Shadowlands </i>will bring a new continent to the game, as well as overhaul existing game systems, and new NPC factions that the players can join — this looks similar to the Aldor/Scryer split in <i>The Burning Crusade</i>, but dramatically expanded. Player choice and the “covenant” system seem to be key features of the new expansion.</p>
      <p>The Shadowlands aren’t as physical or tangible a place as previous expansions, like Kul Tiras or Northrend, so we can likely expect things to get weird during our stay. We also saw a glimpse of Banshee Sylvanas, so she may be a raid boss for us to tackle.</p>
      <p><i>Shadowlands</i> will release in 2020, with raid content at launch, and will be patched in the months after its release.</p>
