      <h1>UPS plans to hire 50,000 workers in one-day hiring blitz</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T18:56:59+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 18:56</time> by <a rel="author">Megan Cerullo</a></address>
      <p>The United Parcel Service has added its own holiday to the fall calendar — dubbed "UPS Brown Friday" — during which it plans to hire 50,000 seasonal workers in a single day on Friday.</p>
      <p>The event is part of the company's larger goal of hiring 100,000 seasonal employees to keep up with what is expected to be heavy demand for shipping services over the <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/walmart-holiday-deals-to-begin-well-before-black-friday/">winter holidays</a>. As part of that effort, the world's largest parcel delivery service on Friday is holding more than 185 hiring fairs across the country, and will make on-the-spot job offers to the best candidates, the company announced. </p>
      <p>Applicants can also <a href="https://www.jobs-ups.com/?utm_source=ups.com&amp;utm_campaign=public_relations&amp;utm_content=2019_Brown_Friday&amp;utm_medium=press_release">submit their resumes online</a>. Open positions include package handlers, truck and tractor-trailer drivers, and driver-helpers. Wages range from $14 an hour for entry-level positions to $37 an hour for roles that require more experience.</p>
      <p>The going rate for a part-time package handler in New York is $19 an hour, according to company spokesman Dan McMackin. Seasonal workers aren't eligible for full benefits, but can receive tuition reimbursement of up to $1,300, he said.</p>
      <p>Over a third of workers who were hired as seasonal package handlers over the last three years later became permanent company employees, UPS said.</p>
      <p>"It's a trial run for both sides," McMackin said. "Maybe you don't like the kind of work — or the elements if you are out being a driver's helper. This gives you a chance to see what the work is like, and it gives the company a chance to see how hard you work."</p>
      <p>Sought-after traits in employees include punctuality and a desire to serve, McMackin said.</p>
      <p>"It sounds cheesy, but we don't produce anything, we serve people, and I think you have to be willing to serve customers directly when you make deliveries, or drivers if you are someone who is loading drivers' trucks in the morning," he said.</p>
