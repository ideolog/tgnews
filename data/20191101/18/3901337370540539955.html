      <p>With FC Barcelona's Gerard Pique often seen as a controversial figure always ready to throw jabs at Real Madrid, the defender has now named a few Los Blancos stars he actually does get along with.</p>

      <p>The centre-back has enjoyed his fair share of player spats over the years, especially with players from Barca's eternal rivals, and especially with their captain Sergio Ramos.</p>
      <p>However, it seems that Pique, contrary to popular belief, does have healthy relationships with a few Los Blancos stars, and he includes Alvaro Morata in that list, despite the striker no longer donning the 13-time UEFA Champions League winners' shirt.</p>

      <p>"I get on really well with Nacho, also with Lucas Vazquez," he said, according to <i>Sport</i>.Â </p>
      <p>"I wouldn't say Sergio Ramos and I are friends, but we have a cordial relationship and there's a lot of respect.</p>
      <p>"It's the same with Alvaro Morata, who's now not at Real Madrid (he's at Atletico Madrid).</p>
      <p>"I have always got on really well with them."</p>
