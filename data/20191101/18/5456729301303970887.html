      <h1>Mokgweetsi Masisi sworn in as new Botswana president</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T18:52:39+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 18:52</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/foreign/africa/360601-mokgweetsi-masisi-sworn-in-as-new-botswana-president.html" target="_blank">Agency Report</a></address>
      <p>Botswana’s President Mokgweetsi Masisi was sworn in on Friday after the Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) won the country’s parliamentary elections last week.</p>
      <p>The mood was upbeat at the University of Botswana venue where about 3,000 guests attended the inauguration of the country’s fifth democratically elected president.</p>
      <p>Mr Masisi has vowed to prioritise job creation during his tenure, in order to curb the country’s increasing unemployment rate.</p>
      <p>The diamond-rich southern African country has long been considered one of Africa’s most stable democracies; however, it has also struggled with high unemployment, which official records peg at 17 per cent.</p>
      <p>Some opposition parties have suggested that it is higher.</p>
      <p>Mr Masisi also reiterated his government’s commitment to wildlife conservation in the country.</p>
      <p>“My government will continue to seek an outcome that will set the tone for conserving our wildlife and elephants in particular,” Mr Masisi said.</p>
      <p>Botswana received a backlash from the international community and animal rights activists after the country lifted a moratorium on elephant hunting in May.</p>
      <p>The lifting of the ban also offended former president Ian Khama, who defected from the BDP to the Botswana Patriotic Front, which also contested the elections.</p>
      <p>The BDP has ruled Botswana since independence from Britain in 1966, overseeing its rise from one of the world’s poorest nations to a middle-income country thanks to diamond production.</p>
      <p>Other African countries were represented at the ceremony with President Emmerson Mnangagwa of Zimbabwe, President Edgar Lungu of Zambia and President Filipe Nyusi of Mozambique in attendance.</p>
      <p>Former Botswana president Festus Mogae was also there, but Mr Khama was notable by his absence.</p>
      <p>The 58-year-old took the oath of office at the University of Botswana Indoor Sports Arena in the capital, Gaborone.</p>
      <p>The swearing-in was Botswana’s first to be held away from the Parliament building.</p>
      <p>BDP won the October 23 vote after securing 38 of the 57 seats in the National Assembly, while the opposition coalition Umbrella for Democratic Change won 15.</p>
      <p>The ruling party has been in power since the southern African country attained its independence in 1966.</p>
      <p>Mr Masisi banked on his record on tackling corruption, such as making the declaration of assets obligatory for public sector officials.</p>
      <p>He is also credited with overseeing a reduction in bureaucracy for small businesses.</p>
