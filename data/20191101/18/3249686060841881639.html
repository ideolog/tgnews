      <p>With just one performance, <b>BTS V</b> captivated the hearts of millions. His charisma on stage is truly incomparable and his performance in these final stages were filled with not only his usual excellent dancing, but the way he actually infused his dance with his emotions and could bring out the pain that is there in the lyrics and could express that is remarkably astounding.</p>

      <p>Kim Taehyung is genuinely one of a kind - he is the whole package a performer should be. We look forward with bated breath to see what new stage he will reveal in the future.</p>
