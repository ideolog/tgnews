      <p>ATHENS (Reuters) - Delta Tankers Ltd said on Friday that it has not been contacted by Brazilian authorities investigating an oil spill incident in Brazil.</p>
      <p>Brazilian investigators said on Friday a Greek-flagged ship carrying Venezuelan crude was the source of oil tarring thousands of kilometers of coastline over the past two months.</p>
      <p>While prosecutors and police did not name the vessel, a prosecutors’ document obtained by Reuters identified the ship as the Bouboulina, owned by Greece’s Delta Tankers Ltd.</p>
      <p>“Neither Delta Tankers nor the vessel have been contacted by Brazilian authorities with regards to this investigation,” the company said in a statement.</p>
