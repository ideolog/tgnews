      <p>K-pop has come a long way since the mid-1990s and early 2000s. There are what many people consider to be 3 generations of idols. </p>
      <p>The first generation starts in 1996 with <b>H.O.T</b>, extending to <b>g.o.d, BoA, Sechskies, S.E.S, Fin.K.L, BoA, Shinhwa,</b> and more.</p>
      <p>The second generation starts in 2004 with <b>TVXQ</b>, extending to <b>Super Junior, Girls' Generation, Big Bang, SHINee</b>, and more.</p>
      <p>And you have the third generation or current generation with <b>BTS, EXO, Wanna One, TWICE, BLACKPINK, Seventeen,</b> and more.</p>
      <p>Who do you think reigns supreme in each generation of the new idols?</p>
      <p>A recent community forum post has garnered a lot of attention for its compilation of the best selling albums from three generations.</p>

      <p><b>g.o.d </b>and <b>H.O.T</b> reigned supreme in the first generation, while <b>Girls' Generation, Super Junior, </b>and <b>TVXQ</b> dominated the second generation. The third generation definitely shows <b>BTS, EXO</b>, <b>Wanna One</b>, and <b>TWICE</b> in the forefront of album sales.</p>
      <p>What do you think of these results? Are you surprised to see such high album sales for the 3rd generation in the current digital age?</p>
