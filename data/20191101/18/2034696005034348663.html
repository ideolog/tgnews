      <p>The new duet version comes after Cara joined Dan Smith and co. on stage in her hometown of Toronto during the band’s recent US tour.</p>
      <p>“I’d always heard ‘Another Place’ as a duet and wanted it to be a story told from two perspectives,” Smith said of the updated version of the track that first appeared on Bastille’s this studio album, ‘Doom Days’.</p>
      <p>“It’s not something we’ve ever done, outside of our mixtapes,” he continued. “But we are huge fans of Alessia’s — her voice and her song-writing are so distinct and brilliant — and we sent it to her to see if she’d be up for jumping on it with us. We love her verse and everything that she’s brought to the song – I think she really elevates it.”</p>
      <p>Cara, who admits to having been a fan of the band since their early material, says the track came together “pretty naturally.”</p>
      <p>“I met Dan last year and we got on really well,” she explained. “We talked about doing something together and he sent me the song a little while later. I loved the concept and thought it was both sonically and lyrically really great, as all Bastille stuff is. It all came together pretty naturally, and I can’t wait for people to hear it.”</p>
