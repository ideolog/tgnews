        <b>New Delhi (Sputnik): The popular Pakistani director and actor Khalil-ur-Rehman Qamar is a renowned name in national cinema for his notable work. However, the director has often become the epicentre of controversies for putting forth his views.</b>

      <p><a href="https://sputniknews.com/viral/201911011077197909-who-watches-the-watchers-pakistani-tik-tok-queen-claims-to-record-famous-pak-cricketer-masturbating/">Pakistani</a> actor and director Khalil-ur-Rehman Qamar is facing the wrath of his peers from the film fraternity and social media users over his “<a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201910011076937055-pakistans-new-envoy-to-un-was-accused-of-beating-up-live-in-girlfriend-in-new-york-in-2002/">misogynist</a>” views on women's infidelity and gang rapes in Pakistan.</p>
      <p>Qamar, who has worked with the bigwigs of Pakistani cinema and penned a number of hit drama series, was talking about his new drama “Mere Pass Tum Ho” in a YouTube podcast. The storyline of the drama revolves around a married woman who gets into a relationship with her boss.</p>
      <blockquote>Calling himself the biggest feminist of Pakistan, the director said, “If you wish to strive for equality then kidnap men as well. Rob a bus, gang rape a man, so that I can understand what you [women] mean by equality.”</blockquote>
      <p>Also, sharing his thoughts about female infidelity, the director said he doesn’t like to call every female a woman, according to him, only those who are loyal to men are women.</p>
      <blockquote>“...Like it or not, I don’t call every woman a woman. To me, the only beautiful trait a woman can possess is her loyalty and her modesty. If a woman isn’t loyal then she is not a woman,” he said.</blockquote>
      <p>Apparently, the idea of Qamar’s gender equality seems to have offended the sensibilities of many, including prominent <a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201910301077178972-twitterati-rage-over-2-year-ban-on-bangladesh-cricket-captain-ahead-of-teams-india-tour/">actors and actresses in Pakistan</a>, who bashed him for his regressive mindset while calling his views “disgusting”.</p>
