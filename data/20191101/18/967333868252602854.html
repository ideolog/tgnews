      <p>A Yamal Airlines representative said on Friday that the Sukhoi Superjet-100 plane successfully landed at the Tyumen airport after experiencing engine failure. The plane with 80 passengers and four crew members people was heading to Saint Petersburg.</p>
      <p>During takeoff, the representative said, a flock of birds hit the engine, resulting in its failure.</p>
      <p>The captain of the plane made a decision to fly the plane in circles over the airport to run out of fuel before making an emergency landing.</p>
      <p>No one was hurt in the incident, the airline representative added.</p>
      <p>Yamal airlines is a Salekhard-based regional carrier that has been operating since 1997.</p>
