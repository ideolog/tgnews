      <h1>Apple asks Trump administration for tariff relief on iPhone parts, AirPods, Apple Watch after last denial</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T18:18:38+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 18:18</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5mac.com/author/michaelpotuck/" target="_blank">Michael Potuck</a></address>
      <p>Apple has officially asked for more exemptions on tariffs that went into effect in Septemeber as part of the US-China trade war. As reported by <i><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-01/apple-requests-tariff-waivers-on-iphone-parts-watch-and-airpods">Bloomberg</a></i>, Apple’s latest formal requests seek another round of exemptions, this time for iPhone components, AirPods, Apple Watch, and more from the current 15% duties.</p>
      <p>Apple has had hit and miss success getting the US Trade Representative’s office to approve tariff waivers for its products and components that are made in China.</p>
      <p>For example, Trump originally said <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/07/26/new-mac-pro-china-trump/">Apple wouldn’t get any relief</a> for Mac Pro components but <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/09/20/trump-apple-mac-pro-tariff-exemption/">10 waivers ended up being approved in September</a>. However, at the end of September, the <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/09/30/apple-mac-pro-us-manufacturing/">remaining requests for Mac Pro waivers were denied</a>.</p>
      <p>Now, Apple has submitted more official requests to the US Trade Representative’s office asking for an exemption from the 15% tariffs currently hitting its Apple Watch, iMac, and some of its iPhone components. Requests were made for a total of 11 products and/or components.</p>
      <p>Other affected products include the highly popular <a href="https://amzn.to/2WxfI8A">AirPods</a>, HomePod, Beats products, and other components like batteries for iPhone and MacBook.</p>
      <p>As for the reasoning for the requests, Apple says it can’t find another source for these products/components.</p>
      <blockquote>In its requests for tariff waivers, the Cupertino, California-based company said it hasn’t identified a source outside of China that is able to meet U.S. demand for the products or components in the coming year. An Apple spokesman declined to comment Friday.</blockquote>
