      <p>In 2016, while studying at Deerfield Academy, she wrote: “People talk about cancer freely; why is it so difficult to discuss the effects of depression, bi-polar, anxiety, or schizophrenic disorders?</p>
      <p>"Just because the illness may not be outwardly visible doesn’t mean the person suffering from it isn’t struggling.</p>
      <p>“I have experienced a lot of stigma surrounding mental health on Deerfield’s campus. As students, we have the power to end that immediately.</p>
      <p>"Stigma places blame on the person suffering from the illness and makes them ashamed to talk openly about what they’re going through."</p>

      <p>Mr Hill and Ms Kennedy married in 1993 four years after the Irishman was released from prison after wrongly serving 15 years behind bars.</p>
      <p>He was one of the Guildford Four, a group of men wrongfully convicted of bombings carried out by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) in 1974.</p>
      <p>Four years after tying the knot, Saoirse, which means 'freedom' in Irish, was born.</p>
