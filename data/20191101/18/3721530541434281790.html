      <p><a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/diablo-4/40629"><i>Diablo 4</i></a><i> </i>was introduced at BlizzCon 2019 with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/1/20942471/diablo-4-blizzard-blizzcon-release-date-announcement">a long cinematic</a> establishing the story of this chapter in the action RPG series. That was immediately followed by the good stuff: three minutes of gameplay.</p>
      <p>Though it is set to an establishing voice-over, pretty much everything here is taken from the player’s perspective, which gives an idea of the rich detail Blizzard is trying to bring to the desiccated land of Sanctuary.</p>
      <p>Three classes and their abilities are also shown: barbarian, sorceress, and druid. Gameplay features like dismount attacks, climbing and descending terrain are threaded into the presentation of just about every biome one could imagine for a fantasy action role-playing-game.</p>
      <p>Here are the three classes’ attributes, from a news release Activision Blizzard issued during Friday’s opening ceremony:</p>
      <blockquote><b>The Barbarian, </b>known for their unparalleled strength and brutal melee combat,<b> </b>utilizes a new and more powerful system in battle, <i>Arsenal</i>, which arms them with the ability to carry and rapidly switch between four different weapons at a time by assigning them to individual attacks.<br/><b>The Sorceress</b> hearkens back to their <i>Diablo</i><i> II</i> roots and shapes the elements to obliterate their foes by impaling them upon jagged spikes of ice, electrocuting them with bolts of lightning, or raining flaming meteors from the sky.<br/><b>The Druid</b> is a savage shapeshifter whose updated playstyle empowers them to fluidly transform between werewolf, werebear, and human form to unleash the raw power of nature’s fury<i> </i>on the forces of the Burning Hells.</blockquote>
      <p><i>Diablo 4 </i>does not yet have a release date or window; it’s in development for PlayStation 4, Windows PC, and Xbox One, and is playable at BlizzCon this weekend.</p>
