      <p>Super Rare Games has today revealed that it has partnered up with Image &amp; Form and Thunderful to release a physical edition of <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/steamworld_quest_hand_of_gilgamech"><b>SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech</b></a> on Nintendo Switch.</p>
      <p>A physical release has <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/01/steamworld_quest_wont_release_physically_at_launch_or_at_all_on_3ds_no_loot_boxes_or_microtransactions">been on the cards</a> since before the game even released, but it's nice to see that the day has finally arrived. Pre-orders for the physical edition will be going live exclusively on <a href="https://superraregames.com/">Super Rare Games</a> on 7th November.</p>
      <p>Strangely enough, the deal with Super Rare took place over a game of chess between company founder George Perkins and CEO of Image &amp; Form, Brjann Sigurgeirsson. In a press release covering the announcement, Perkins says, "I jokingly mentioned that if I beat him he would have to sign with us to release SteamWorld Quest physically! I got beat very, very badly but luckily we still managed to sign the deal".</p>
      <p>Excitingly, he goes on to say, "I hope we can bring the rest of the amazing SteamWorld series as a physical release in the near future". <i>Yes please</i>.</p>

      <p>If you need a catch up on what SteamWorld Quest is all about, make sure to <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/steamworld_quest_hand_of_gilgamech">check out our full review</a>. We'll leave just a snippet below:</p>
      <blockquote>"Remarkably solid and satisfying, SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech is a card battler with an abundance of charm in its art, mechanics and writing. The presentation is slick, the dialogue’s witty and the gameplay’s addictive, although nothing about it feels particularly <i>special</i> – not in the way <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/steamworld_dig_2">SteamWorld Dig 2</a></b> felt special. It does what it does well, though, and it’s still a thoroughly enjoyable time in that universe."</blockquote>
