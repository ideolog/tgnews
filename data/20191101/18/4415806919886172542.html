      <p>Four men have appeared in court charged with assault, false imprisonment and criminal damage as well as animal cruelty in Roscommon last year.</p>
      <p>There was a significant Garda presence at Castlerea District court today for their appearance in connection with an incident at a repossessed farmhouse in Falsk, Strokestown, on December 16.</p>

      <p>The court heard that Mr Sweeney and Mr O'Toole had previously been before the court on charges connected to incidents at Falsk, but more charges were now before the court.</p>
      <p>Evidence of arrest, charge and caution was entered on behalf of Mr Beirne and Mr Lawlor, but they did not reply to any of the charges.</p>
      <p>All four are charged with assault, criminal damage, arson, theft as well as a cruelty to animal charge and all four were granted bail with conditions</p>
