      <p>A day after the House voted to <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/house-votes-impeachment-resolution">formally outline the impeachment inquiry process</a>, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) says she expects public hearings related to the impeachment inquiry to begin this month.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-01/pelosi-expects-public-impeachment-hearings-to-begin-this-month">Bloomberg TV</a> Friday, Pelosi said that although she “assume[s] there would be public hearings in November,” any impeachment case against the President “has to be ironclad.”</p>
      <p>“I don’t know what the timetable will be — the truth will set us free,” Pelosi said. “We have not made any decisions on if the President will be impeached.”</p>
      <p>In the meantime, Pelosi said that closed-door testimonies will continue on the condition that they remain “productive.”</p>
      <p>Pelosi added that she doesn’t rule out the possibility of the impeachment inquiry extending into next year’s election cycle given how it’s possible for new investigative leads to arise.</p>
      <p>“There is — I should say — a mountain of concerns to be brought up,” Pelosi said.</p>
      <p>Pelosi also echoed a point she made on<a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/pelosi-colbert-interview-impeachment-inquiry"> “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert”</a> Thursday night when she said that the memorandum of the now-infamous July phone call between Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky made her realize that the call “was something that you could not ignore.”</p>
      <p>“[The July phone call] changed everything in the public mind,” Pelosi said.</p>
