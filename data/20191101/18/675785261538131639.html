      <h1>Arsenal squad confirmed for Wolves as Mesut Ozil included but Granit Xhaka omitted</h1>
      <h2>Arsenal look to bounce back to winning ways at the Emirates, after being knocked out of the Carabao Cup in midweek</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T18:54:00+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 18:54</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Richards, https://www.facebook.com/AARichards/</a></address>
      <p>Granit Xhaka trained with the Arsenal first team on Friday but the Gunners' captain will not play against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> on Saturday afternoon.</p>
      <p>The Swiss international reacted angrily to the reaction of supporters last weekend, telling them to "f*** off" after being substituted in the 2-2 draw with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> .</p>
      <p>Xhaka did not play in the Carabao Cup against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> in midweek, and speaking on Friday Unai Emery confirmed he won't be in action in north London against Nuno Espirito Santo's side.</p>
      <p>“He is training normally, but like every human he feels emotions. Xhaka's issues last week need time to recover the normality with him and with us.</p>
      <p>“Everybody will have some social media on their phone, on the internet, on the web, but really to use it is only to be intelligent.</p>

      <p>“We can respect the people on social media, but we have to separate how much of it is real and whether every supporter is following that.</p>
      <p>“In the stadium, is is normal when we are not winning that they respond with some criticism – and then, when you come back with a good performance, they forget that and they applaud the players.</p>
      <p>“Our objective is to win (against Wolves), connect with the people and for the supporters to respond to us, and help us in the 90 minutes.</p>
      <p>“Xhaka has said sorry, he gave apologies to the supporters, to everybody, and now the focus is on our next match.”</p>

      <p>Mesut Ozil is set to feature, having played 65 minutes on Merseyside in midweek - his first outing since September 24.</p>
      <p>“Yes, he will feature," confirmed Emery on Friday. "We will look at the possibility to use him again.”</p>

      <p>Having made wholesale changes at Anfield, Emery is likely to return to something like a first choice side against Wolves.</p>
      <p>David Luiz and Sokratis, both of whom scored against Palace, are set to return at the heart of defence, but Emery has decisions to make at full-back and in midfield - notably who steps in as Xhaka's replacement.</p>
      <p>Reiss Nelson remains sidelined with a knee problem.</p>
