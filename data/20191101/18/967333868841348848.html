      <p>French fighter jets have struck several Daesh targets in northeastern Iraq, France’s Defence Ministry announced in a statement on Friday.</p>
      <p>The operation was conducted by Dassault Rafale fighter aircraft in cooperation with other members of the anti-terror international coalition.</p>
      <blockquote>“The objective was to destroy several tunnels used by Daesh as a rear base for its activities, and to degrade its logistical and military capabilities in the region,” the ministry said, adding that no civilians were near the target during the attack.</blockquote>

      <p>“France's position is constant and its determination to fight terrorism remains intact. Yesterday, the French air force bombed several caches and tunnels [belonging to] Daesh, to which we give no respite,” Defence Minister Florence Parly said of the airstrike on Friday.</p>
      <p>France has nearly 1,000 troops as part of the US-led coalition fighting terrorists in Syria and Iraq, including over a hundred soldiers deployed in Baghdad to train and advise Iraqi forces.</p>
      <p>Daesh, whose self-declared caliphate has been all but eliminated after five years of war, suffered a significant blow after <a href="https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/201910311077191359-daesh-confirms-death-of-al-baghdadi-following-us-raid-names-successor/">its long-time leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was killed</a> during a US-led raid last Saturday.</p>
