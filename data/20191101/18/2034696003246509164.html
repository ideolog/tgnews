      <p>Titled <i>Hunters, </i>it arrives in 2020, and follows a pack of Nazi hunters from 1970s New York.</p>
      <p>A synopsis for the new show reads: “<i>Hunters</i> follows a diverse band of Nazi hunters living in 1977 New York City. The Hunters, as they’re known, have discovered that hundreds of high-ranking Nazi officials are living among us and conspiring to create a Fourth Reich in the U.S.</p>
      <p>“The eclectic team of Hunters will set out on a bloody quest to bring the Nazis to justice and thwart their new genocidal plans.”</p>
      <p>The series is also set to feature Logan Lerman (<i>The Perks of Being A Wallflower</i>), Josh Radnor (<i>How I Met Your Mother</i>), Kate Mulvany (<i>The Great Gatsby</i>) and more.</p>
      <p>Watch a short teaser trailer for ‘Hunters’ below:</p>

      <p>Alongside Peele, the show was created by David Weil, who also executive produces and serves as a showrunner alongside executive producer Nikki Toscano.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Al Pacino appears alongside long-time collaborator Robert De Niro in new Martin Scorsese film <i>The Irishman</i>. In a new interview, though, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/this-is-it-robert-de-niro-doesnt-think-hell-make-another-movie-with-al-pacino-and-martin-scorsese-2563440">De Niro says the pair might not make movies together in the future</a>.</p>
      <p>“I don’t see us putting on a movie like this,” he said. “I hope we do other films together, but like this? Not likely. This is it.”</p>
