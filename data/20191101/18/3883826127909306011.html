        <b>John Bercow is demanding an apology from the Daily Mirror over claims he asked for £1m to appear on "I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here!"</b>
      </p>
      <p>The outgoing Commons Speaker has accused the paper of "publishing lies despite being advised of the truth" and has complained to the press watchdog.</p>
      <p>The Mirror claimed talks between Mr Bercow and ITV broke down over the size of his appearance fee.</p>
      <p>It said it stood by its story, which was based on "authoritative sources".</p>
      <p>However, the newspaper also said it was "happy to accept" that Mr Bercow had "no serious desire to appear" on the programme.</p>
      <p>Mr Bercow, who retired on Thursday after 10 years in the Speaker's chair, is understood to be furious about the story.</p>
      <h3>'Utterly trashy'</h3>
      <p>In a letter to the Mirror's showbiz editor, he said: "I must make it clear to you in the most uncompromising terms that I have not had the slightest interest now or at any time or an any basis to go on that programme."</p>
      <p>He adds that he "did not at any time to anybody ask for £1m to go on the show, which I consider to be utterly trashy".</p>
      <p>He demands an apology from the paper and threatens legal action, if the "false allegations" are repeated.</p>

      <p>The Mirror suggested representatives for Mr Bercow had been in talks with ITV about him appearing on the next series of the reality show, in which celebrities take part in a series of eye-watering challenges, such as eating insects or being trapped underground with snakes.</p>
      <p>It said Mr Bercow had "allegedly demanded a £1m fee" for appearing in the next series, due to start in December.</p>
      <p>This was £400,000 more than any previous contestant had received, the newspaper reported.</p>
      <h3>'Grave concern'</h3>
      <p>It suggested ITV had confirmed discussions had broken down over the question of Mr Bercow's fee, quoting an unnamed source saying "he has priced himself out of the market".</p>
      <p>Mr Bercow has written to the Independent Press Standards Organisation to claim it is factually untrue and a breach of the editor's code.</p>
      <p>In its response, the watchdog said: "We are looking at the points you raise, and will be in touch shortly."</p>

      <p>In a text message to TV agent Nicki Clarke, who originally approached Mr Bercow with the idea of appearing, ITV talent producer Micky Van Praagh suggested the story was "obviously nonsense and I have no idea where it has come from".</p>
      <p>She added: "ITV has not confirmed that talks broke down because of money. Please can you apologise to John for me for the story."</p>
      <p>In an e-mail to Mr Bercow, Ms Clarke, who works for Shine Talent Management, said the story was "incredibly frustrating" and she had expressed her "grave concern" to ITV about it.</p>
      <p>The Mirror said the story was "based on information from authoritative sources".</p>
      <p>"We are confident that conversations took place between ITV and a representative for John Bercow about appearing on I'm a Celebrity and that these talks broke down over money," a spokesman said.</p>
      <p>A host of politicians have appeared on I'm A Celebrity over the years, including Conservative MP Nadine Dorries and Boris Johnson's father, Stanley.</p>
      <p>Last month, Boris Johnson joked that he would like to see Mr Bercow perform the infamous Bushtucker Trial and eat a kangaroo's testicle.</p>
