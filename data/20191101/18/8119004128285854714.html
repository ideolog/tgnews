        <b>Police have recovered the bodies of a readymade garment trader’s mother-in-law and her housemaid with throats slashed at their home in Dhaka’s Dhanmondi.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Support staff of the house No. 21 styled Lobelia on road No. 28 called police after finding the bodies in a flat on the fifth floor of the building near Nazrul Institute sometime after 7pm on Friday.</p>
      <p>Dhanmondi Police Station OC Abdul Latif identified the victims as TeamTex Group Managing Director and Creative Group Deputy MD Kazi Monir Uddin Tarim’s mother-in-law Afroza Begum, 65, and her 18-year-old house help “Bithi”.</p>
      <p>One of the bodies was lying near a sofa while the other on the floor of the next room, Dhaka Metropolitan Additional Deputy Commissioner Azimul Haque Azim told bdnews24.com.</p>
      <p>A closet and other things in the flat, where the victims resided, were ransacked, Azim said.</p>

      <p>“We are investigating who carried out the killings and why,” he added.</p>
      <p>Businessman Tarim resides in two other flats with his family and has rented out two others.</p>
      <p>Nuruzzaman, a security guard at the building, said a member of the support staff of Tarim’s family, “Bachchu”, took a new housemaid to Afroza’s flat in the afternoon.</p>
      <p>Bachchu came down after around an hour for some reason and left later in the evening, Nuruzzaman said.</p>
      <p>The new housemaid left the house after around another 45 minutes, according to the security guard.</p>
      <p>Tarim told the media Bachchu got the new house help through a betel leaf trader of the neighbourhood and the woman is behind the murders.</p>
      <p>He said money, three mobile phones, savings certificates, jewellery and other valuables were lost.</p>

      <p>“I took Bachchu to a nearby shop to buy soup. Suddenly a guard phoned Bachchu and told him that (mother) has been murdered,” Tarim said.</p>
      <p>Bachchu rushed home at once, the businessman said.</p>
      <p>“It’s a planned murder,” he said and added he suspected a guard was involved.</p>
      <p>Security guard “Atik” said police took away Bachchu, three guards, a cleaner and an electrician for questioning.</p>
      <p>A male house help, “Riaz”, told bdnews24.com Tarim’s wife told him to see why her mother was not answering phone calls in the evening.</p>
      <p>He saw the body of Afroza when pushed the door open after no-one answered it, he said.</p>
      <p>Another house help, “Apel”, said he rushed to the flat on hearing Riaz’s cry.</p>
      <p>Bithi’s body was on the floor of a guest room, he added.</p>
      <p>DMP Additional Commissioner Krishnapada Roy visited the house and told the media after midnight that the new housemaid was 22-23 years old.</p>
      <p>“It would be easy to find the motive if we can find her. We are exploring all possible angles and also whether only one person or many were involved,” he said.</p>
