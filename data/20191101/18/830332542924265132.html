      <p>MADISON, Wis. - The head of the University of Wisconsin System's Board of Regents has named a search committee to find candidates to replace retiring system President Ray Cross.</p>
      <p>Regent President Andrew Petersen said Friday that board Vice President Michael Grebe will chair the committee. Other members include Petersen, regents Mike Jones, Edmund Manydeeds and Torrey Tiedeman, UW-Madison Chancellor Rebecca Blank, UW-La Crosse Provost Betsy Morgan, UW-Superior Chancellor Renee Wachter and former regent Regina Millner.</p>
      <p>The committee is expected to begin its search in December. The panel will work with a national search firm to identify and screen candidates. The full Board of Regents will make the hiring decision.</p>
      <p>Cross has served as system president since 2014. He announced last week he'll retire after regents choose his replacement.</p>
