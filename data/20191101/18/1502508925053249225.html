      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T18:28:00+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 18:28</time> by <a rel="author">Reuters</a></address>
      <p> A World Trade Organization (WTO) panel said on Friday that China was entitled to slap compensatory sanctions on U.S. imports worth $3.579 billion (£2.76 billion) annually for the US failure to remove anti-dumping duties - roughly half the amount China had sought.</p>
      <p>The decision came as the world's two biggest economies try to clinch Phase 1 of a trade deal. President Donald Trump and US negotiators are "very optimistic" about concluding it, White House adviser Larry Kudlow said.</p>
      <p>In the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/wto">WTO </a>ruling, a three-member arbitration panel said Chinese exporters suffered impairment to trade valued at $3.579 billion annually. China may now ask the WTO's Dispute Settlement Body for a green light to impose the retaliatory tariffs on imported U.S. goods valued up to that amount each year.</p>
      <p>China told the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/wto">WTO </a>in September 2018 that it had suffered $7.043 billion in damages annually due to U.S. anti-dumping duties ruled illegal by a <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/wto">WTO </a>panel in 2016 and later upheld. China therefore requested permission to raise trade barriers on U.S. goods to the same amount, as allowed under WTO rules.</p>
      <p>As the Trump administration objected to the amount, the issue was sent to arbitration.</p>
      <p>The case relates to US dumping duties on industries including machinery and electronics, light industry, metals and minerals, and the US Commerce Department's way of calculating the amount of "dumping" - Chinese exports that are priced to undercut American-made goods on the US market.</p>
      <p>The US calculation method, known as "zeroing", tended to increase the level of U.S. anti-dumping duties on foreign producers and was repeatedly ruled to be illegal in a series of trade disputes brought to the WTO.</p>
      <p>The US Trade Representative's office in Washington had no immediate response.</p>
