      <p>Publishing giant Nikkei lost roughly 29 million dollars after an employee of the Nikkei America subsidiary was tricked by scammers to send the funds to a bank account they controlled.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nikkei.co.jp/nikkeiinfo/en/about/core/">Nikkei</a> is one of the world's largest media corporations with around 4 million print and digital subscribers, and more than 40 affiliated companies involved in publishing, broadcasting, events, database services, and the index business.</p>
      <p>The media group acquired the Financial Times in 2015, and it currently <a href="https://www.nikkei.co.jp/nikkeiinfo/en/news/release_en_20190710_01.pdf">has 37 foreign editorial bureaus</a> and about 1,500 journalists all around the world.</p>
      <h3>BEC scam reported to authorities</h3>
      <p>BEC (short for business email compromise) and otherwise known as Email Account Compromise, CEO fraud, or CEO impersonation is a fraud scheme through which crooks trick a company's employees into transferring funds to attacker-controlled bank accounts they control either via computer intrusion or by using social engineering.</p>
      <p>In Nikkei America's case, the scammers requested wire transfers using fraudulent information by posing as a Nikkei executive.</p>
      <p>"In late September 2019, an employee of Nikkei America, Inc. (New York City, United States) ('Nikkei America'), a subsidiary of Nikkei Inc. ('Nikkei'), had transferred approximately 29 million United States dollars (approximately 3.2 billion Japanese Yen) of Nikkei America funds based on fraudulent instructions by a malicious third party who purported to be a management executive of Nikkei," <a href="https://www.nikkei.co.jp/nikkeiinfo/en/news/press/597.html">said</a> the company in a press release.</p>
      <p>Nikkei America also filed a damage report with both US and Hong Kong authorities and "retained lawyers to confirm the underlying facts" after discovering the fraudulent transfers made during late September 2019.</p>
      <p>The company is in the process of recovering the stolen funds and is also "taking measures to fully cooperate with the investigations."</p>
      <p>"In order to maintain the confidentiality of the investigation by relevant authorities, we will refrain for the time being from providing any more details about the matter," added Nikkei's PR office.</p>
      <h3>High profile fraud victims</h3>
      <p>The BEC scam reported by Nikkei on October 30 follows a similar <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/over-37-million-lost-by-toyota-boshoku-subsidiary-in-bec-scam/">attack from September against Toyota Boshoku Corporation</a>, a Toyota Group car components manufacturer.</p>
      <p>The company announced on September 6 that one of its European subsidiaries lost over $37 million following a business email compromise (BEC) attack that took place on August 14.</p>
      <p>According to their release, Toyota Boshoku Corporation's expected financial loss following the incident is of about 4 billion yen ($37,472,000 or €33,904,000).</p>
      <p>On the whole, <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cybercrimes-total-earnings-skyrocketed-to-27-billion-says-the-fbi/">BEC victims lost more than $1,2 billion in 2018</a> as per an Internet Crime report issued by FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3).</p>
      <p>The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/bec-scams-average-301-million-per-month-in-illegal-transfers/">also published a report</a> stating that BEC SAR (short for suspicious activity reports) filings grew from a $110 million monthly average in 2016 to over $301 million per month in 2018.</p>
      <p>The FBI also said in a <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/business-email-compromise-is-a-26-billion-scam-says-the-fbi/">BEC public service announcement issued in September</a> that victim complaints related to 166,349 domestic and international incidents were received between June 2016 and July 2019, with a total exposed dollar loss of more than $26 billion.</p>
