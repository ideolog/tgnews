      <p>A disabled teenager with Down syndrome was forced to attend 'degrading' work assessments by the Department of Work and Pensions.</p>
      <p>Declan Kemp, 19, has Down syndrome, cerebral palsy, a hole in his heart and suffers from scoliosis of the spine - meaning he is permanently confined to a wheelchair.</p>
      <p>But his family claim the DWP made him attend an assessment in person to check is ability to work.</p>
      <p>Declan already receives Personal Independence Payment (PIP), which is intended to help adults with the extra costs of living with a long-term health condition or a disability.</p>
      <p>But when his family, from Teesside, applied for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/what-universal-credit-benefit-explained-13390461">Universal Credit</a> he was made to attend Stockton Job Centre to undergo a work capability assessment, despite his long term disabilities, reports <a href="https://www.gazettelive.co.uk/news/teesside-news/dwp-sorry-after-forcing-declan-17184021">Teesside Live.</a></p>
      <p>Described by his loving family as a "beautiful and happy person", Declan struggled through one appointment - falling asleep after around 15 minutes, they said.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>His family say they had shown Job Centre staff his health passport which list his conditions, and asked for a home visit.</p>
      <p>Despite this, he was summoned again to the Job Centre, where staff went through the same information, his family claim.</p>
      <p>Declan's sister and carer Sue, 41, said: "Basically, Declan's unable to work. He struggles with physical movements because of his disabilities.</p>
      <p>"He left Abbey Hill school in July, and he goes to a day centre three times a week, and sometimes stays in respite care.</p>
      <p>"My mam made a claim for Universal Credit for him, and was told he had to go for an assessment - even though he already gets PIP, so they know the conditions he has.</p>
      <p>"The first appointment was over an hour, and he was asleep after 15 minutes. We had to go through everything as he can't speak for himself.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>"But then they had to go through another assessment - and we were told he needed a sick note from the doctor, to prove he can't work.</p>
      <p>"Why does he have to prove again that he is disabled?"</p>
      <p>Sue said that Declan's mum Joan, who lives with the teen on Stockton's Tilery estate, had to get another sick note as the original one ran out - and was told to fill in the Universal Credit journal, an online record of what claimants are doing to find work.</p>
      <p>"Obviously Declan can't do that, and my mam can't use the computer," continued Sue.</p>
      <p>"She's been completely stressed, and he's picked up on that now and suffered because of it.</p>
      <p>"What's happened to Declan shouldn't have happened - we need to get the message out that the system just didn't work.</p>
      <p>"The way he has been treated is completely unnecessary, and degrading."</p>

      <p>"The way he has been treated is completely unnecessary and degrading."</p>
      <p>A DWP spokesperson said: " We are sorry that Mr Kemp's claim was not handled correctly and have apologised to his mother for any distress caused.</p>
      <p>"There was no delay in the processing of his Universal Credit and we will make sure home visits are put in place in future.”</p>
