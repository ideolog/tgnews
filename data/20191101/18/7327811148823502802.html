      <p>They were covered up <a href="https://7ny.tv/2JHa1A1">back on September 2nd </a>as the work began.</p>
      <p>The marble lions have welcomed visitors to the 42nd Street Library since it opened in 1911.</p>
      <p>"Patience" and "Fortitude" were given their names by Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia during the Great Depression.</p>
      <p>He believed New Yorkers needed those virtues to make it though tough times.</p>
