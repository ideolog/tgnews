      <p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin made progress on a variety of issues during a telephone call on Friday with China’s Vice Premier Liu He about an interim trade agreement, USTR said in a statement.</p>
      <p>“They made progress in a variety of areas and are in the process of resolving outstanding issues,” USTR said. “Discussions will continue at the deputy level.”</p>
      <p>The statement stopped short of confirming that the two sides had reached consensus on principles, as reported earlier by Beijing’s state media Xinhua News Agency.</p>
