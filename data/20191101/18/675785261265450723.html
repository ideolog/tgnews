      <h1>Amazon Alexa may have recorded moment woman was killed during row with boyfriend</h1>
      <h2>Cops in Hallandale Beach in Florida have obtained recordings from the devices from Amazon's server</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T18:33:51+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 18:33</time> by <a rel="author">Joseph Wilkes, https://www.facebook.com/dailymirror/</a></address>
      <p>Police believe two Amazon Alexa smart speaker devices may have captured audio of the moment a man killed his girlfriend.</p>
      <p>Officers in Hallandale Beach in Florida, US, told local media they had received recordings from Amazon after beginning an investigation into Adam Reechard Crespo.</p>
      <p>The 43-year-old has been charged with murder after the death of 32-year-old Silvia Galva.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/01/florida-cops-suspect-amazon-device-captured-audio-of-a-womans-death/">NYPost</a> reports Crespo told police he tried to drag Galva off his bed during an argument on July 12, in which he claims she took hold of a spear which had a 12-inch blade.</p>
      <p>Crespo claims he heard the spear snap as he pulled her off the bed before turning around and realising the blade was in his girlfriend's chest.</p>

      <p>The NYPost reports he told police that he pulled the blade out as he hoped his girlfriend's wounds were "not too bad".</p>
      <p>Police wrote a probable cause statement to obtain a warrant to search the address and demand the recordings from Amazon. This was a month after the alleged incident.</p>
      <p>They said: "It is believed that evidence of crimes, audio recordings capturing the attack on victim Silvia Crespo that occurred in the main bedroom…may be found on the server maintained by or for Amazon.”</p>

      <p>Police have not made clear what evidence may be contained in the data recorded by two Alexa devices between  July 11 and July 12.</p>
      <p>Amazon spokesperson Leigh Nakanishi told the <a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/crime/fl-ne-amazon-alexa-murder-investigation-20191031-qccpvdl6kng5hcx3z6eusxa264-story.html">South Florida Sun-Sentinel</a> : “No audio is stored or sent to the cloud unless the device detects the wake word.”</p>
      <p>Amazon's Alexa devices do not start recording until a user says something like 'Alexa,' 'Amazon,' 'computer” or 'Echo'.</p>

      <p>Amazon's website states: "You’ll always know then Alexa is recording and sending your request to Amazon’s secure cloud because a blue light indicator will appear or an audio tone will sound on your Echo device."</p>
      <p>The devices have a mute button that electronically disconnects the microphones and which allows users to review their recordings at any time and delete them.</p>
      <p>Crespo posted a $65,000 bond and was released from custody. He awaits his next court appearance.</p>
