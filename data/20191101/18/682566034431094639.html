      <p>London - <b>Dele Alli </b>needs people to rally round him in an effort to try and lift his form which has seen him lose his place in the England squad, <b>Tottenham Hotspur </b>manager <b>Mauricio Pochettino </b>said on Friday.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old midfielder - whose goal scoring has slipped from 23 in all competitions in the 2016/17 campaign to just seven last season - is not the only player to have under-performed for last season's Champions League finalists.</p>
      <p>But Alli's dip has attracted more comment than most although injury has restricted him to just seven appearances this term.</p>
      <p>Pochettino - whose side enter the weekend in 11th place eight points off the Champions League spots - said people should take stock of how young Alli is.</p>
      <p>"We need to remember that he's so young and the pressure is massive," said Pochettino at his Friday press conference ahead of Sunday's away trip to Everton.</p>
      <p>"He's English and everybody expects big things from him but he's still 23 years old.</p>
      <p>"He was fantastic then he dropped a bit in his performance but we must back him.</p>
      <p>"We have to pay attention, to focus and try to improve in the way that everyone expects."</p>
