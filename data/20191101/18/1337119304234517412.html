      <h1>NBCUniversal reportedly considering making its Peacock streaming service totally free</h1>
      <h2>Prepare for ads</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T18:14:00+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 18:14</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/julia-alexander" target="_blank">Julia Alexander</a></address>
      <p>Comcast and NBCUniversal are reportedly weighing whether to make its upcoming Peacock streaming service free for all customers, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/01/nbc-peacock-may-be-free-for-all-users.html">according to CNBC</a>.</p>
      <p>This is different from the companies’ previously announced plans. Originally, the goal was to offer a free, ad-supported service to Comcast customers, while reports suggested that non-Comcast customers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/14/nbcuniversal-announces-streaming-service-that-will-be-free-to-paid-tv-subscribers/">could subscribe to Peacock for a fee</a>. The new plan will let anyone watch an ad-supported version of the streaming service for free, according to CNBC. Customers who want an ad-free version may be able to pay for a more premium service, the report adds. If true, Peacock would become the first major streaming platform to have an entirely free, ad-supported option since Hulu’s earliest days.</p>
      <p>Peacock, which <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/17/20870213/nbcuniversal-peacock-streaming-service-name-price-launch-date-battlestar-galactica">launches in April 2020</a>, will come with a slate of original series, alongside reboots of popular NBC series like <i>Punky Brewster </i>and <i>Battlestar Galactica. </i>Peacock will also be home to many of NBC’s most popular shows, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/14/18623037/disney-hulu-netflix-warnermedia-att-friends-the-office-this-is-us-streaming">including <i>The Office</i></a>, which leaves Netflix in 2021. Feature movies from the Universal arm of NBCUniversal will also be available to stream.</p>
      <p>Nothing is concrete yet, and Comcast has a history of convoluted pricing schemes. The company announced plans in September to give a free streaming box away to all of its internet-only subscribers, except in reality, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/22/20879610/comcast-flex-free-streaming-box-subscription-fee-price">customers had to pay for an additional rental to qualify</a>.</p>
      <p>Still, an ad-supported, free streaming service makes sense for Comcast — and it also separates the company from competition, like HBO Max ($14.99 a month), Disney+ ($6.99 a month), Netflix ($8.99 a month), and Apple TV Plus ($4.99 a month). <i>The Verge </i>has reached out to NBCUniversal and Comcast for comment.</p>
