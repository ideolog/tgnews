      <p>The first televised election debate between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn has been set for November 19.</p>
      <p>The debate will be aired on ITV and it will be the first time the party leaders go head to head in the election campaign.</p>
      <p>Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn challenged Mr Johnson to a debate earlier in the week, and on Friday said it was "welcome" that he accepted.</p>
      <p>"This is a once in a generation election. So it's welcome that Boris Johnson has accepted our challenge of a head to head TV debate. The choice could not be clearer: Boris Johnson's Conservatives protecting the privileged few or a Labour government on the side of the many," Mr Corbyn tweeted on Friday.</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson also took to Twitter to comment on the debate.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"Looking forward to making the positive case to the country that we should £GetBrexitDone &amp; deliver on the people's priorities - £OurNHS, schools, tackling crime &amp; the cost of living," he said.</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister was accused of running scarred from TV debates by rival Jeremy Hunt during the race to take over the Tory Party after the departure of Theresa May.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Mr Johnson did take part in two one-on-one debates during the battle for the Tory crown, but not before Mr Hunt and others placed him under great pressure to do so.</p>
      <p>ITV Press Centre made the announcement on Twitter on Friday afternoon and said details of further multi-party debates will be released in due course.</p>
