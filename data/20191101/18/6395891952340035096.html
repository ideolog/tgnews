      <p><b>WASHINGTONÂ (AP)</b> - The Trump administration is proposing a rule that would allow faith-based foster care and adoption agencies to continue getting taxpayer funding even if they exclude LGBT families and others from their services based on religious beliefs.</p>
      <p>The White House says the rule is needed to remove barriers that prevent some nonprofits from helping vulnerable people in their communities.</p>
      <p>The Family Research Council, a conservative advocacy group, applauded the move. It says charities would no longer have to choose between "abandoning their faith or abandoning homeless children."</p>
      <p>But LGBT groups say the administration's plan would reduce the pool of qualified parents wanting to adopt or foster a child. They say that nearly 123,000 foster children are awaiting adoption, but the rule would make even fewer families available to them.</p>
