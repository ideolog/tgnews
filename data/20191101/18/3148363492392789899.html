      <p>The left-wing Hollywood star and activist was arrested again in Washington D.C. as part of her ongoing series of weekly climate protests. It marks the fourth time in four weeks that Fonda has been apprehended by authorities since announcing that she was taking a break from Hollywood and devoting herself to “climate justice.”</p>
      <p>On Friday, Fonda was arrested with a new cast of characters including actresses Rosanna Arquette and Catherine Keener.</p>

      <p>Fonda and her fellow Hollywood stars were arrested in the U.S. Senate Hart Building, according to a Twitter post from Fire Drill Fridays, the actress’ climate activism group.</p>
      <p>The Twitter post shows video of Fonda being handcuffed and led away by police. The <i>Klute</i> star is seen waving and giving a double thumbs-up to the cheering crowds.</p>
      <p>Arquette can be seen in a separate video raising her fist as police cuffed her and led her away.</p>
      <p>The group also posted footage showing members unveiling a large sign saying “Women Demand a Green New Deal” and “Women Demand No New Fossil Fuels.”</p>
