      <h1>Teen climate activist seeks lift back across Atlantic to climate meet</h1>

      <p><b>LOS ANGELES: </b>Teen climate activist Greta Thunberg had made it half-way from Sweden to Chile by boat, train and electric car when next month’s United Nation (UN) climate summit was unexpectedly scrapped.</p>
      <p>But as a new venue was announced on Friday for the gathering called COP25 — this time in Spain — the 16-year-old didn’t bat an eyelid: she simply asked for a lift back across the Atlantic.</p>

      <p>“As #COP25 has officially been moved from Santiago to Madrid I’ll need some help,” Thunberg tweeted from Los Angeles. “It turns out I’ve traveled half around the world, the wrong way:)”<br/>“Now I need to find a way to cross the Atlantic in November… If anyone could help me find transport I would be so grateful,” said the teen, who refuses to fly because of the carbon emissions involved.</p>

      <p>Thunberg’s highly publicised journey has so far involved crossing on a zero-emission sailboat from the coast of England to New York, traveling overland through North America by train and in an electric car borrowed from Arnold Schwarzenegger.</p>
      <p>She was one of around 25,000 delegates expected in Santiago for the United Nations climate summit, until Chile pulled out as host this week due to deadly anti-government protests.</p>

      <p>The United Nations announced on Friday that COP 25 will finally take place in Madrid, on the original scheduled dates of December 2-13.</p>
      <p>The Swedish teen activist Thunberg rose to prominence last year after she started spending her Fridays outside Sweden’s parliament, holding a sign reading “School strike for climate.”</p>
      <p>Students across the world began emulating her campaign, leading to organised school walkouts and the rise of the “Fridays for Future” movement which targets government action on climate change.</p>
