      <h2>Jade Thirwall made a brutal joke about former boss Simon Cowell's pecs when she appeared on Drag Race UK</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T18:57:43+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 18:57</time> by <a rel="author">Verity Sulway, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/verity-sulway/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jade-thirlwall">Jade Thirwall</a> threw the ultimate shade at her former X Factor and record label boss <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/simon-cowell">Simon Cowell</a> when she appeared on Ru Paul's Drag Race UK on Thursday night.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/little-mix">Little Mix</a> star was a guest judge on the panel, and when introducing her, Ru Paul compared her judging style to Simon Cowell.</p>
      <p>Simon judges the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/x-factor">X Factor</a> , which Little Mix won in 2011, and is traditionally known as the harshest judge.</p>
      <p>Ru Paul asked Jade: "Now you're a judge, what is going to be the biggest difference in your style of judging versus Simon Cowell's?"</p>

      <p>Jade joked back: "Well for starters Ru, Simon has much bigger t**s. It really is true."</p>
      <p>Fellow judges Ru, Michelle Visage and Graham Norton burst out laughing at her savage comment.</p>
      <p>Jade looked stunning in a baby blue metallic cami dress with a white feather boa, paired with blue sky high platform stilettos and white socks.</p>

      <p>She honoured the drag queens with heavy make up including a stunning glittery blue cut crease eye look and thick black eyeliner.</p>
      <p>The BBC Three show saw the next drag queen eliminated following a lip synch to Little Mix's Power.</p>
      <p>This week's theme was girl bands, and the queens created a concept, lyrics and choreography for their three-piece band.</p>
