      <p>MADISON, Wis. - A Madison substitute teacher is on leave as the school investigates a "serious incident" involving the use of a racial slur, an official said. </p>
      <p>Hamilton Middle School Principal John Burkholder said in a letter to students' families Thursday that the teacher used a racial slur while a student was present, and that the district is investigating. </p>
      <p>The teacher was put on leave, according to the letter. </p>
      <p>Madison Teachers Inc. Executive Director Doug Keillor told News 3 Now the union doesn't comment on incidents that are still under investigation by the district. </p>
      <p>"While I cannot get into details, I want to emphasize that racial slurs have no place in our school," Burkholder wrote. </p>
      <p>The school said its top priority has been to support the student involved and take the appropriate next steps, "and that is where our focus has been."</p>

      <p>"We will remain focused on supporting our students and making our school climate safe and caring for all students, and ask for your help in that work," Burkholder wrote.</p>
      <p>In the last year, <a href="https://www.channel3000.com/news/education/another-madison-teacher-used-racial-slur-in-school-principal-says/978429181">multiple Madison school staff</a> have been fired for using racial slurs at school. A teacher at Madison East and another at Madison West, were <a href="https://www.channel3000.com/news/education/2-more-madison-teachers-investigated-on-reports-of-using-racial-slurs-at-schools/869801906">removed from Madison classrooms</a> in November 2018 after they reportedly used racial slurs. That same month, a Velma Hamilton Middle School teacher resigned from the district after she was accused of <a href="https://www.channel3000.com/news/education/madison-teacher-accused-of-yelling-n-word-at-student-resigns/869533931">yelling the N-word</a> at a 12-year-old student. </p>
      <p>The district initially fired Madison West High School security guard Marlon Anderson in mid-October, citing its zero-tolerance policy on racial slurs. Anderson argued his case was different because he was asking a student to stop using the term. The Madison teachers' union filed a grievance on behalf of Anderson with the district, and West High School students held a walkout in support of Anderson. Even <a href="https://www.channel3000.com/news/cher-offers-to-incur-expenses-for-anyone-who-sues-mmsd-over-recent-employee-firing/1133510217">superstar musician Cher weighed in</a> on Twitter, offering to pay for a lawsuit against the MMSD board. </p>
      <p>MMSD reinstated <a href="https://www.channel3000.com/news/im-blessed-marlon-anderson-happy-to-have-job-back-but-says-fight-isnt-over/1134391611">Anderson's</a> job on Oct. 21.</p>
