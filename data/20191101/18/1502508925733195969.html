      <p>In the investment banking &amp; markets cohort, <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/hsbc">HSBC </a>was the highest recruiter, extending eight offers. Other prominent recruiters in the cohort included Arpwood Capital, Avendus Capital, Bank of America Merrill Lynch (India and Hong-Kong), Citibank, Credit Suisse (Singapore and India), Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Moelis, <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/morgan-stanley">Morgan Stanley </a>and Nomura Singapore.</p>
      <p>IIM-A also saw an increased participation in the PE and VC domain, with firms like Arga Investment Management, Brookfield, Edelweiss, Eight Roads, Kois Invest, Macquarie PE, <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/morgan-stanley">Morgan Stanley </a>PE, Omidyar Network, NIIF, Temasek, Venture Highway and White Oak.
