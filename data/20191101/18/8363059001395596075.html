      <h1>Can A Battery Made From 1000 Lemons Start A Car?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T18:30:57+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 18:30</time> by <a rel="author">Tegan Jones</a></address>
      <p>It's the question that nobody ever asked, and yet it has now been answered.</p>
      <p>While lemons (and potatoes) are often turned into mini batteries for school project, we've never heard of anyone combining the power of a thousand to power a car.</p>
      <p>Until now.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCydCOEgfcXAQnkRaLCTsAQ">Garage 54</a>, a YouTube account known for its outlandish motoring experiments, made the attempt in one of its recent videos.</p>
      <p>Yes, they really took the time to cut up and hook up that many lemons for this experiment. Respect.</p>
      <p>We won't spoil the outcome, but hope you enjoy the ride and "juice" jokes.</p>
