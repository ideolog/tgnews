      <h1>Diablo IV announced at BlizzCon 2019</h1>
      <h2>Finally</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T18:15:00+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 18:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/andrew-webster" target="_blank">Andrew Webster</a></address>
      <p><i>Diablo IV</i> is finally official. Blizzard announced the game at the opening ceremonies for BlizzCon 2019 in Anaheim, California, and it marks the first entry in the series since 2012’s <i>Diablo III</i>. The game was revealed with a lengthy cinematic, showing off a new, darker tone that harkens back to earlier games in the series. Here’s how Blizzard describes the basic premise:</p>
      <blockquote><i>Diablo IV</i> takes place many years after the events of <i>Diablo III</i>, after millions have been slaughtered by the actions of the High Heavens and Burning Hells alike. In the vacuum of power, a legendary name resurfaces.</blockquote>

      <p>During the event, Blizzard stressed that <i>Diablo IV</i> would go back to the franchise’s “darker roots,” which, among other things, means more blood and gore. The first three announced classes are the barbarian, sorceress, and druid. Here’s a first, short look at the actual gameplay:</p>

      <p>And here’s Blizzard on the technology behind the new game:</p>
      <blockquote><i>Diablo IV</i> is being developed using modern technology that pushes the franchise to dark, new depths. This technology is at the heart of everything players will see, hear, and feel — delivering much higher fidelity and a more engrossing experience. It opens up countless possibilities for the <i>Diablo </i>series, from smooth character animations, such as the Druid’s fluid shapeshifting, to the seamless, vast overworld players will travel across in search of the next loot-filled underground dungeon. Ultimately, <i>Diablo IV</i> will ground players in a grittier and deadlier world.</blockquote>
      <p>While rumors of a fourth mainline Diablo game have persisted for some time, Blizzard hadn’t officially spoken about the game until today. At last year’s BlizzCon, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/2/18056370/diablo-immortal-mobile-blizzard-blizzcon-2018">the company revealed <i>Diablo Immortal</i></a>, a mobile spinoff that has yet to actually launch one year later. Meanwhile, back in March, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/7/18254558/diablo-classic-digital-gog-blizzard-windows-10-purchase">the original <i>Diablo</i> was made available digitally for the very first time</a>.</p>
      <p>There’s no word yet on a release date for <i>Diablo IV,</i> but it will be coming to the PC, PS4, and Xbox One.</p>
