      <p>TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) — The U.S. Department of Homeland Security says it’s extending temporary protected status coverage for migrants from El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua and Sudan through Jan. 4, 2021.</p>
      <p>The Trump administration has been trying to end TPS for those countries since 2018, but that move has been tied up in court appeals.</p>
      <p>The department said Friday the extension was enacted to comply with court injunctions against the move, which it said it’s appealing.</p>
      <p>Honduras’ president says TPS status has allowed over 40,000 Hondurans to live and work in the United States since Hurricane Mitch caused widespread damage in Honduras in 1999.</p>
      <p>President Juan Orlando Hernandez wrote in his Twitter account that, “We will continue working to find a permanent and humane solution for out Honduran brothers.”</p>
