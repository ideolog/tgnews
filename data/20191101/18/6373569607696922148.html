      <p>Thieves who broke into a Stoke home made off with a haul of valuable items including a vintage Gibson guitar.</p>
      <p>The thieves struck on Sunday October 27 at a residential property where they stole a rare wine cherry coloured 'ES 345 model' Gibson guitar and a natural wood coloured 'Epiphone Hound Dog'.</p>
      <p>The burglary took place between 1am and 9am at the victim's home address while he slept.</p>
      <p>Detectives believe the suspect or suspects entered the property via a back window.</p>
      <p>The Gibson guitar bears the serial number 06104422. The guitar is believed to have been purchased around 1979 and has an approximate value of £4,000. It was held in a hardback leather case with a sticker of a 3D hummingbird and black and white 'Guitar Bar' sticker. The guitar itself is an ES 345 model and was made in 1977.</p>
