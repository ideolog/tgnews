      <p>LAGOS, Nov 1 — Police in Nigeria said they rescued 15 people chained up in a church in Lagos during the latest raid in a nationwide crackdown on religious institutions accused of abuse.</p>
      <p>Detectives “stormed a prayer house used as a detention camp” on Wednesday evening and discovered 15 men and women aged between 19 and 50 chained by the legs, Lagos police spokesman Bala Elkana said.</p>
      <p>The pastor of the church, “prophet” Sunday Joseph Ojo, and 10 others were arrested, Elkana said late yesterday.</p>
      <p>The victims “were brought by their families to seek spiritual help from mental illness and other diseases,” he added.</p>
      <p>“The prophet said he has been in the healing ministry since 1986, (and) that he chained them in order to prevent escape.”</p>
      <p>Some of the victims had spent five years in the church, he said, adding that further investigations were taking place.</p>
      <p>Non-government organisations first alerted police to Ojo’s “Blessing of Goodness Healing Church” in the Ijegun area of Nigeria’s most populous city, according to local reports.</p>
      <p>The raid was the first on a church during a wider police crackdown on religious institutions—the majority of which have been Islamic schools—where inmates have been tortured, chained and sexually abused.</p>
      <p>Hundreds of victims, mostly children, have been rescued in a series of raids over the past month, mainly across northern Nigeria.</p>
      <p>Last week police rescued 108 “unfed and sick” inmates from a so-called reform centre in Kwara State, central Nigeria. </p>
      <p>Religious institutions offering to “reform” victims of mental illness and drug abuse are common in Africa’s most populous country in the absence of state support. — AFP</p>
