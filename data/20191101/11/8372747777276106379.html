      <p>SHARPSVILLE â€” Police are warning parents to carefully check their children's Halloween loot after receiving <a href="https://www.theindychannel.com/news/local-news/police-in-indiana-issue-warning-after-parents-report-pain-pills-tacks-in-kids-halloween-candy">reports of pain pills and tacks in the candy.</a></p>
      <p>The Sharpsville Fire Department posted the warning on Facebook on Halloween night after receiving a message from the concerned parent who found what appeared to be a "small bag of Prescription Pain Pills" inside their child's candy.</p>
      <p>"It is very important that all child's bags are checked before any consumption," the department said.</p>
      <p>They believe this was an isolated incident, but are still warning parents to keep a close eye on their children's Halloween candy.</p>
      <p>In Crawfordsville, Indiana, police say a parent reported that their child's candy had been tampered with. The parent reported their child had been trick-or-treating in the West Main Street area.</p>
      <p>One parent in Crawfordsville posted to social media that their child had received a Hershey's Kiss in their Halloween bucket that had a tack in it. It is unclear if there were any other reports of tampered candy in the city.</p>
      <p>If you suspect any of the candy you received to have been tampered with, contact your local police department to make a report.</p>
