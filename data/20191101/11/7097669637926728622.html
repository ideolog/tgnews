      <h1>U.S.-Led Coalition Blocks Russia in Syria While Allowing Turkey to Terrorize the Kurds</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T11:59:00+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 11:59</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://nationalinterest.org/" target="_blank">Matthew Petti</a></address>
      <p>The Trump administration is using firepower to block Iran and Russia from coming up from the south while ignoring the pleas of the Kurds to stop a Turkish invasion from the north.</p>
      <p>The Pentagon is using a well-known two-steps-to-the-right tactic to avoid becoming immersed in regional chaos. It is observing acts of war while not preventing them from happening in order to appease an ally that has more political clout than another partner—and a stockpile of U.S. nuclear weapons in its backyard. In fact, an official at the U.S.-led counter-ISIS coalition recently reiterated to the <i>National Interest</i> that “no U.S. forces will participate in operations related to the implementation of the ‘safe zone.’”</p>
      <p>But this tactic may create problems than military officials initially expected.</p>
      <p>“We hold the Pentagon responsible for all the crimes committed by Turkey if they don’t close the airspace,” Syrian Kurdish executive president Ilham Ahmed claimed at a press conference in Washington. “It doesn’t require any military commitment.”</p>
      <p>Ahmed’s argument is based on the fact that the U.S. government is notified of all Turkish and Russian movements through the region under a “deconfliction” agreement between the various militaries operating in northeast Syria, so it is aware of when Turkey is preparing to launch an attack. To date, the U.S. military has not been willing to stop Turkish airstrikes against the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). And coalition officials say there have been confirmed sightings of U.S. forces near the Syrian-Turkish border. These officials told the <i>National Interest</i> that their movements were part of a deployment to the oil-rich region of Deir ez-Zor.</p>
      <p>War hawks in the Trump administration have been obsessed with countering America’s adversaries, Iran and Russia, in Syria. They continue to cling to their long-floated <a href="https://nationalinterest.org/blog/middle-east-watch/inside-iran-hawks-hijacking-trumps-syria-withdrawal-plan-90041">plan</a> to peel off Arab elements of the SDF in Deir ez-Zor, which would basically<a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/10/30/iran-hawks-botched-trump-syria-policy-james-jeffrey-turkey/"> sabotage</a> President Donald Trump’s attempts to remove U.S. troops from Syria.</p>
