      <h1>Three problems at the top of new RBS boss Alison Rose's to-do list</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T11:35:58+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 11:35</time> by <a rel="author">Sebastian McCarthy</a></address>
      <p>Alison Rose begins life as the new boss of RBS today with her work cut out for her.</p>
      <p>In a letter to staff this morning, the RBS lifer set out her commitments, which included “a clear focus on shared success” and “investment in people”.</p>
      <p>But as the firm’s recent quarterly financial results demonstrated, there is a much wider range of challenges facing the new CEO.</p>

      <h3>Under-performing divisions</h3>
      <p>“Weak across the board” is how Barclays recently described the situation, with income, costs and impairments all disappointing investors.</p>
      <p>Given that her predecessor Ross McEwan tackled most of the major legacy issues, Rose’s focus is likely be geared towards improving the underperforming divisions in the business.</p>
      <p>As the latest results show, the most embattled of those is the investment bank Natwest Markets, which Jefferies analyst Joe Dickerson described as “deplorable” following a 44 per cent drop in core income.</p>
      <p>There are already mutterings over whether Rose will look to improve the ailing arm or find a route out of it altogether.</p>

      <h3>Fierce competition</h3>
      <p>Rose will also be faced with the unenviable task of improving the bank’s net interest margin – a key profitability target that has come under pressure amid an increasingly competitive battle in the residential mortgage market.</p>
      <p>Analysts also point out that RBS, like many of Britain’s large lenders, faces threats from online-only banks.</p>
      <h3>Political headwinds</h3>
      <p>AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould said: “Fundamentally, it is a very difficult time to be a bank right now.</p>
      <p>“What really makes banks profitable is positive interest rates, a steep yield curve and wide credit spreads, and you haven’t got any of them.</p>

      </p>
      <p>“All [RBS] can do is lend with great prudence and keep a close eye on your costs.”</p>
      <p>On the bright side, the bank has maintained its outlook, growth continues in commercial retail lending and hopes of a Brexit deal are on the up.</p>
      <p>Yet most analysts agree that as the uncertainty rumbles on, one thing Rose does have in her control is the ability to keep a handle on costs.</p>
      <p>At least – as one analyst points out – the RBS veteran “will be more familiar than most with where the remaining fat lies”.</p>
