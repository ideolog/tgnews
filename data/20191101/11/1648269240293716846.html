      <h1>Analyst Says PSA Is Paying A 32% Premium To Take Control Of FCA</h1>
      <h2>The family that owns much of Fiat's stock makes around $1 billion off the deal.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T11:25:19+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 11:25</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.motor1.com/info/team/chris-bruce/" target="_blank">Chris Bruce</a></address>
      <p>The tie-up between <a href="https://www.motor1.com/tag/fca/">FCA</a> and <a href="https://www.motor1.com/tag/psa/">PSA</a> isn't the merger of equals as much as the automakers attest. "Achieving a 50/50 shareholding suggests PSA is paying a 32 percent premium to assume control of FCA," Jefferies analyst Philippe Houchois said in a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-31/investors-know-who-the-buyer-is-in-fiat-peugeot-merger-of-equals"><i>Bloomberg</i></a> report. "PSA shareholders are assuming more market risk."</p>

      <p>This means that to reach the 50-50 margin for the merger, PSA has to pay out a lower dividend to investors than FCA. The Peugeot side will off-load nearly €3 billion ($3.4 billion at current exchange rates), which will come in large part from selling off parts supplier Faurecia, according to <i>Bloomberg</i>.</p>
      <p>Conversely, FCA will offer a nearly €5 billion ($5.6 billion) dividend to investors. This will include selling robotics company Comau for €250 million ($279 million), according to <i>Bloomberg</i>.</p>
      <p>If there's a big winner from this deal, it's the Agnelli family that controls Exor, which is the holding company that's FCA's largest shareholder. Exor will make 1.65 billion euros ($1.85 billion) from the merger, and around €900 million ($1 billion) will go to the Agnellis.</p>
      <p>The new company will have a board with five members from FCA and six from PSA. Peugeot boss Carlos Tavares will be CEO and will have one of the firm's seats on the board.</p>
      <p>Following the merger, the automaker <a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/379538/psa-fca-merger-plan-announced/">will be the fourth-largest automaker in the world</a>. The future of the company's products remains a mystery, though. They estimate 80 percent synergies after four years, which should cust costs by €2.8 billion ($3.12 billion). These figures suggest the likelihood of parts sharing for future vehicles. It's entirely possible that some brands could get the axe.</p>
