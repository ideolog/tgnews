      <p><a href="http://nme.com/artists/harry-styles">Harry Styles</a> has thrown his hat into the ring to become the next James Bond.</p>
      <p>The ‘Sign of The Times’ singer has confirmed that he’s interested in tackling the iconic role, after Daniel Craig confirmed that the upcoming <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/james-bond-no-time-to-die-finishes-filming-thats-a-wrap-2561362"><i>No Time To Die</i></a> will be his final outing as the iconic super-spy.</p>
      <p>He told Hits Radio: “Yeah, I mean, who wouldn’t [want to be Bond]?</p>
      <p>“I grew up watching those. You know, I loved him when I was a kid. So I think it’s kind of everyone’s dream a little bit, right?”</p>
      <p>Styles, who made his acting debut in Christopher Nolan’s <i>Dunkirk</i>, now joins the likes of Idris Elba, James Norton and even Peaky Blinders’ Cillian Murphy – who <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/peaky-blinders-star-cillian-murphys-bond-odds-slashed-2474437">have all been linked with the role.</a></p>

      <p>The same interview also saw Harry discussing how recent single ‘Lights Up’ was inspired by his own “self-discovery” in recent years.</p>
      <p>“For me it’s a very uplifting song. And I think in places it’s kind of dark,” he said.</p>
      <p>“But to me, it’s very liberating … it’s about self-reflection and self-discovery and just, like freedom. It feels like very free to me. Things that I’ve been trying to process and, I guess, wrestle with a little bit over the last couple years.</p>
      <p>“It’s kind of like just accepting all of those things. It’s a very positive song to me.”</p>
