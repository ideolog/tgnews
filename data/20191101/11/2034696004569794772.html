      <p>Jennifer Aniston has spoken of the “isolation” she felt after <a href="http://nme.com/tag/friends"><i>Friends</i></a> finished.</p>
      <p>The star appears in new TV comedy <i>The Morning Show</i>, set to air this week on Apple TV+.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>On <i>The Morning Show</i>, Aniston plays news broadcaster Alex Levy, and the show follows her as her co-anchor Mitch Kessler (played by Steve Carell) is accused of sexual misconduct and fired from his position.</p>
      <p>Now, speaking about the new show to <i><a href="https://ew.com/tv/2019/10/30/jennifer-aniston-morning-show-alex-levy/">Entertainment Weekly</a>, </i>Aniston has admitted that she feels particularly attached to the role, as she’s able to get into the headspace of a famous TV personality and understands the “isolation” it brings.</p>

      <p>“I understand that, with people having connections to <i>Friends</i>,” Aniston said, reflecting on how much the public feel like they know her life inside out.</p>
      <p>“I understand the isolation – not wanting to be seen, not wanting to be public, not wanting to have to go on a red carpet. It’s not always easy to go out there and have to be the person that you have to be.”</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/tv/jennifer-aniston-friends-cast-working-on-something-2562155">Jennifer Aniston said she was “working on something” with the other members of the <i>Friends</i> cast</a>. It came after she recently <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/tv/jennifer-aniston-explains-friends-movie-will-never-happen-2556765">explained why a <i>Friends</i> movie will never happen</a>.</p>
      <p>Aniston also <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/tv/friends-star-jennifer-aniston-reveals-frustration-over-pay-gap-on-iconic-sitcom-2559941">recently spoke about the disparities in pay on </a><i>Friends </i>and revealed that she was left frustrated that some of the stars were being paid more than others.</p>
