      <p>Embakasi East Member of Parliament Paul Ongili famously known as Babu Owino now wants Jowie Irungu, Ex-fiancee to tv girl Jackie Maribe released on bail.</p>
      <p>Irungu was arrested last year and detained in connection to the murder of Monica Kimani.</p>
      <p>According to the legislator, the judiciary has been unfair and is being used by ‘powerful and monied’ individuals to defeat justice, who are released on bail and the ‘poor’ detained.</p>
      <p>Through an Instagram post, Owino cited a list of murder suspects who have been released on bail, linking their cases to Jowie’s who has since been in detention.</p>
      <p>“The Judiciary is being used. When Obado was a accused of murdering Sharon he was given cash/bond term. Sarah Wairimu  prime suspect in Cohen murder was released on bond/bail. Jowie should be given bond/bail until found guilty to be able to be jailed,” read part of the post.</p>

      <p>Owino added Jowie was still held and languishing in detention because he was poor calling upon the judiciary to exercise the Marxism’s of law Equity is Equality.</p>
      <p>“Is it because Jowie is poor that he is being frustrated by rich judiciary? The Marxism’s of law is that equity is equality. Release Jowie on bail,” read the post.</p>
      <p>Monica Kimani, a business woman aged 28 was found murdered in a bathtub at her Kilimani Apartment Lamuria Gardens.</p>
      <p>It was a case of murder termed most foul that detailed suspects TV girl Jackie Maribe and her fiancee Jowie Irungu among other suspects.</p>

      <p>Jowie was identified positively as the last person to have met the lady in her apartment, with raveling details of a pistol and the incident of shooting himself putting him at the center of the murder as the main suspect.</p>
      <p>He was arrested on September 20, 2018, arraigned and detained.</p>
