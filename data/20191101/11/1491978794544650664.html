      <p>England captain Owen Farrell got some goal-kicking tips from Rugby World Cup winner Jonny Wilkinson on Friday, a day ahead of the final against South Africa.</p>
      <p>Wilkinson scored the drop goal that won England their first ever World Cup in 2003 in the last minute of extra time against Australia – so who better than him to impart his wisdom on Farrell?</p>
      <p>England face South Africa in a repeat of the 2007 final, which saw the Springboks lift the Webb Ellis Cup for the second time. </p>
