      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T11:42:54+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 11:42</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Hutcheon, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/paul-hutcheon/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/nicola-sturgeon">Nicola Sturgeon</a> has upped the stakes in the general election campaign by insisting a Labour Government <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/indyref-2">will agree to indyref2</a> .</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scottish-national-party">The First Minister</a> made the claim days after she had a private meeting with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.</p>
      <p>Sturgeon has demanded another referendum in 2020 and will formally request the power from the UK Government by Christmas.</p>
      <p>Labour used to be hostile to a second referendum, but shadow chancellor John McDonnell overturned the policy in the summer by saying that his party would not block one.</p>
      <p>He and Corbyn's spokesman later added that indyref2 would not be considered in the formative years of a Labour Government.</p>
      <p>It is widely believed the new position is based on an assumption Labour is unlikely to win a majority and may have to rely on SNP votes to take office.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>However the Tories, who have ruled out giving MSPs the power to organise another referendum, pounced on the u-turn and claimed Labour is weak on the Union.</p>
      <p>At a campaign event in Leith today, Sturgeon said the SNP would not back any formal coalitions after the December election, but praised the Labour stance.</p>
      <p>The UK Labour position, as far as I can tell, is [that] they oppose independence, they don’t want a second referendum. That's all perfectly legitimate. I don’t agree with it, but it’s legitimate. But they accept that it’s not for Westminster to decide these questions.</p>
      <p>Asked by the Daily Record whether she believed Labour would grant a Section 30 order, which would temporarily transfer the power to organise a referendum Holyrood, she said: "Yes".</p>
      <p>Asked why she was so confident, she replied: "I'm a believer in the power of democracy.</p>
      <p>"I don't think, in your heart of hearts, any of you believe that this attempt to block the will of the Scottish people is sustainable."</p>
      <p>It emerged yesterday that Corbyn and Sturgeon met for one-to-one talks in London on October 23rd.</p>
      <p>Days earlier, the First Minister had warned the Labour leader not to bother picking up the phone unless he was prepared to back a second vote.</p>
      <p>She also said yesterday that her discussions with Corbyn had centred around Brexit, rather than independence.</p>
