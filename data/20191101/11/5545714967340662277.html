      <h1>What is your favorite era of PlayStation?</h1>
      <h2>PS2 hands down</h2>

      <p>After <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../ps4-sales-finally-beat-out-the-ps1-and-the-wii-570931.phtml">reporting that the PS4 had beaten the Wii and the original PlayStation</a> and became the second-best selling home console of all-time (behind the PS2), I had no idea that such an interesting conversation would break out among the community.</p>
      <p>Folks started not only sharing what their favorite era of PlayStation history has been, but their favorite consoles in general. It got me thinking: we need to settle this once and for all, just like we settled that <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../what-is-your-favorite-bethesda-era-fallout-game--322918.phtml">Obsidian's <i>Fallout: New Vegas</i> was the clear-cut best modern <i>Fallout</i> game</a>.</p>
      <p>I honestly think it's anyone's game. Although I wouldn't put money on the PS3 (I was there for the launch of every system, the PS3 was rough early yet as studios tried to conform to its rigid architecture), I was surprised at how many fans that big block of a system had in the aforementioned comments section. For me, the answer took me around five seconds: the PS2.</p>
      <p><i>GTA III, Resident Evil 4, Metal Gear Solid 2/3, Final Fantasy X, Okami, God of War 1/2, Devil May Cry 1-3</i> (the whole trilogy!), <i>Bully, Ico, Shadow of the Colossus</i> (!), K<i>atamari Damacy</i>. I could go on and on, so I will: <i>Persona 3/4</i> (both!), the continuation of the <i>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</i> series, <i>Viewtiful Joe</i>, <i>God Hand</i>, <i>Kingdom Hearts</i>, <i>Splinter Cell</i>. It's just too much! Most of these series are still around today or are still being ported in remaster/remake form.</p>
      <p>The PS2's insanely packed library came before a time of extreme shovelware, and like the Dreamcast, it's easy to just look at the master list and pick out a mountain of classics. For that reason alone the PS2 may never be dethroned, both in terms of sales and quality.</p>
