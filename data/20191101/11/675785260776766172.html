      <h1>BREAKING Conor McGregor to plead guilty to assault charge as UFC star appears in court</h1>
      <h2>McGregor stood accused of assaulting a man in a Dublin pub after he refused a shot of the fighter's whiskey</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T11:42:05+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 11:42</time> by <a rel="author">Martin Domin, https://www.facebook.com/mirrorfighting</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/conor-mcgregor">Conor McGregor</a> is to enter a guilty plea in court in connection with an incident at a pub in Dublin.</p>
      <p>The mixed martial arts star is facing a single charge of assault and appeared in court this morning.</p>
      <p>Dublin District Court was told that the 31-year-old, of Lady Castle, Straffan, Co Kildare, is to plead guilty to the offence.</p>
      <p>The court heard that the victim, Desmond Keogh, did not want to give a victim impact statement.</p>
      <p>The victim has accepted an apology from the accused, the court was told.  </p>
      <p>McGregor stood accused of assaulting Keogh at the Marble Arch pub in Drimnagh on April 6.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/other-sports/mma/conor-mcgregor-live-court-case-20558050">The 31-year-old initially appeared in court last month</a> but asked for the case to be adjourned until today.</p>
      <p>McGregor has not fought in the UFC since he was choked out by lightweight champion Khabib Nurmagomedov last October.</p>
      <p>But last week he announced he will return on January 18 in Las Vegas - likely against Donald Cerrone.</p>
      <p>Both Cerrone and UFC president Dana White have confirmed a deal is close which will see McGregor headline at the T-Mobile Arena.</p>

      <p>And the Dubliner's long-time coach John Kavanagh also said he believes an announcement is imminent.</p>
      <p>He told ESPN: "Like Dana said nothing is 100 per cent until all contracts are signed. As far as I am aware all parties have agreed more or less in principle. </p>
      <p>"There may be a few kinks to be ironed out. But, as far as I am aware, hopefully, an announcement is imminent.</p>

      <p>“I’m just happy to see him back competing and is in a great mindset. We are training away, chipping away.</p>
      <p>"It is 11 weeks tomorrow and ticking all the boxes. I can’t wait for the announcement so we can be full steam ahead.</p>
      <p>"But, I am sure it is, I actually had in my head maybe during this event [UFC 244] they are going to do an ad or something, I don’t know, maybe that is coming.”</p>
