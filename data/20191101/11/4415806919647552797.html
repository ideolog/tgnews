      <p>Investigators are inspecting the burned-out ruins of Shuri Castle on Okinawa to determine the cause of a fire that almost completely destroyed the symbol of the Japanese island’s cultural heritage.</p>
      <p>The fire burned down the three main halls and four nearby structures at the castle in Okinawa’s prefectural capital Naha. It took firefighters 11 hours to extinguish the blaze.</p>
      <p>More than 130 investigators are inspecting the site on Friday.</p>
      <p>They believe the blaze started inside the Seiden, the castle’s centrepiece, at around 2.30am on Thursday.</p>

      <p>The late hour and the castle’s design, with a spacious wooden main hall connected to other main buildings by hallways, might have allowed the flames to spread quickly.</p>
      <p>Shuri Castle is a Unesco World Heritage site, which dates from the 1429-1879 Ryukyu Kingdom era.</p>
      <p>The castle, which burned down during the Second World War, was largely restored in 1992 for the 20th anniversary of Okinawa’s reversion to Japan which ended the island’s 27-year US occupation.</p>
      <p>Historians and other experts had continued their restoration efforts until recently.</p>
      <p>Many Okinawans expressed deep sorrow and devastation over the near-loss of Shuri Castle, which is a symbol of their cultural roots as well as the history of their struggle since the 1879 annexation by Japan.</p>

      <p>Okinawa governor Denny Tamaki said his heart was broken, but he expressed his determination to reconstruct the castle.</p>
      <p>Mr Tamaki, who cut short a trip to South Korea and returned to Naha on Thursday, was in Tokyo on Friday meeting top officials of the central government to seek their support.</p>
      <p>Chief cabinet secretary Yoshihide Suga expressed his sympathy to Okinawans, adding that the government is willing to do everything it can to help the castle’s reconstruction.</p>

      <p>The castle had hydrants, alarms, portable extinguishers and water outside the buildings, but there were no sprinklers installed inside, Naha fire department official Ryo Kotani said.</p>
      <p>The fire was detected when a security guard at the gate closest to the main structures rushed to Seiden in response to an alarm, Mr Kotani said.</p>
      <p>The blaze had engulfed the hall and spread to nearby structures when firefighters arrived about 20 minutes later.</p>
      <p>Treasures displayed at the castle are replicas of originals safely stored elsewhere in the city, fire officials said.</p>
