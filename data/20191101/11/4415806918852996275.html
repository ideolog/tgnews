      <p>Nigel Farage has thrown down a challenge to Boris Johnson insisting that if the Prime Minister does not drop his EU Withdrawal Agreement and form a “Leave alliance” the Brexit Party will field a candidate in every seat in Britain.</p>
      <p>Launching the party’s General Election campaign in Westminster, Mr Farage said that the PM’s deal did not represent Brexit.</p>
      <p>Mr Farage said that if the Tories did not agree to an alliance and abandon the deal he would make sure every household in the country was made aware it was a “sell out” of Brexit.</p>
      <p>The Brexit Party leader said that if Mr Johnson did not agree to his terms: “We will contest every single seat in England, Scotland and Wales.”</p>
      <p>He added: “I say to Boris Johnson – drop the deal.”</p>
