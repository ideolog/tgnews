      <p>​Earlier, the Office of the United States Trade Representative announced 25 October it was suspending $1.3 billion in trade preferences for Thailand under the Generalised System of Preferences, or GSP, because of its failure to adequately protect worker rights.</p>
      <p>Thailand has faced complaints for years over labour issues, particularly in its fisheries industry.</p>
      <p>Keerati Rushchano, acting director-general of the Commerce Ministry’s Foreign Trade Department, said on 28 October that Thailand will try to negotiate the issue before it takes effect in April, as did Thai Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha in separate remarks Monday.</p>
      <p>The US Trade Representative’s announcement said the GSP eligibility was open to periodic review.</p>
