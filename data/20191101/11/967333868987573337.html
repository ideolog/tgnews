        <b>A private dinner was hosted on 29 October at US President Donald Trump’s hotel in Washington, DC, for House Republicans who fundraised the most, and reportedly featured a lengthy speech from the president that digressed into a roast of GOP members.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The US President raised some eyebrows during a private fundraiser at the Trump Hotel in Washington DC, which was attended by House Republicans on Tuesday night, writes <i>Politico</i>.</p>
      <p>As the attendees - House Republicans who had conducted the most lucrative fundraising - dined on steak, mashed potatoes, and asparagus, the president was said to have launched an hour-long unscripted speech, where he roasted some of the GOP members, as well <a href="https://sputniknews.com/viral/201910291077170538-dinosaurs-police-and-minion-trumps-participate-in-halloween-at-white-house-video/">as his own wife, Melania</a>.</p>
      <p>During his outpouring, Trump used the near-fatal shooting of House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA) in 2017 during a congressional softball game to apparently take a dig at the first lady.</p>

      <p>Trump reportedly started by noting how tough Scalise was, while warning against getting shot as a weight-loss strategy.</p>
      <p>Trump then said Scalise’s wife “cried her eyes out when I met her at the hospital that fateful day… I mean not many wives would react that way to tragedy. I know mine wouldn’t.”</p>
      <p>Twitter’s reaction to the remark was quite uniform, for once, as many online folks agreed with Trump’s words.</p>
