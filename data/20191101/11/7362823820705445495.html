      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/heidi-klum-hints-halloween-costume-very-special-party">Heidi Klum</a> shocked the world with her gory Halloween costume on Thursday.</p>
      <p>For two decades, Klum has hosted an <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/heidi-klum-halloween-costume">extravagant Halloween party</a> for all of Hollywood’s A-listers. Appearing at her 20th Annual Halloween Bash in New York City, Klum turned heads in her humanoid-alien hybrid attire.</p>
      <p>Adorned in prosthetics, metal plates, dripping intestines and exposed rubber breasts, the mechanized, bloodstained alien look was no easy feat to accomplish.</p>

      <p>In a process that took over 12 hours, the model teased fans on Instagram with several posts on Thursday detailing the entire makeup process.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4Si6MXpdkI/">first hint</a> at an actual costume came in the form of a video, where Klum was seen slipping into a bodysuit with the help of several friends.</p>
      <p>Later in the day came a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4SxJxgJXE2/">shot of her in the bodysuit</a>, which had a zombie-esque look and showed off intestines.</p>

      <p>Hours later, fans got to see <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4S3Dr6p_CF/">a shot of Klum's face</a> -- sort of.</p>
      <p>Eventually the “Queen of Halloween” unveiled the costume at midnight, drawing a very positive reaction from her 6.8 million followers.</p>
