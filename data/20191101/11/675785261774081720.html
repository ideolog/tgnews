      <h1>BREAKING Nigel Farage begs Boris Johnson for massive general election alliance - or else</h1>
      <h2>The craven Brexit Party leader laid out his terms for a wildly unrealistic deal he claimed could see the Tories stand aside in up to 150 seats</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T11:29:43+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 11:29</time> by <a rel="author">Dan Bloom, Oliver Milne, https://www.facebook.com/mirrordanbloom, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/oliver-milne/</a></address>
      <p>Nigel Farage today begged Boris Johnson for a massive "leave alliance" which could see Tory and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a> Party candidates stand down to back each other at the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/general-election">general election</a> .</p>
      <p>The seven-time failed Westminster candidate declared he was "more than willing to compromise" - if the Tory dumps his "dreadful" Brexit deal and pivots to no-deal instead.</p>
      <p>That, he claimed, could involve up to 150 Tory candidates stepping aside in seats where they have little hope - in exchange for the Brexit Party not contesting any other Tory seats.</p>
      <p>If not, Mr Farage claimed, "we will contest every single seat in England Scotland and Wales".</p>
      <p>He threatened: "Please don’t doubt we are ready... Next Monday we have 500 candidates coming to London and they will all be signing their candidate forms on that day."</p>
      <p>Yet a deal looks unlikely after a senior member of Johnson's team told journalists Farage was not a "fit and proper person" and "should never be allowed anywhere near government."</p>

      <p>And Mr Farage stumbled when asked for the details of what a leave alliance would actually mean in practice - and whether candidates would truly pull out.</p>
      <p>Asked if it could mean asking Tory candidates to stand aside in 150 seats, Mr Farage said he'd offered the "upper end" but it was a negotiation.</p>

      <p>He said: "It could be a non aggression pact. There are lots of different ways this could be done."</p>
      <p>The comments came at a press conference to launch the Brexit Party campaign today.</p>
