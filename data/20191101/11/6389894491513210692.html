      <h1>Nigel Farage: Brexit Party will contest 'every seat' if PM rejects olive branch</h1>

      <p>Nigel Farage has offered an olive branch to Boris Johnson by calling for a “leave alliance” with the Brexit Party in return for softening his Brexit position.</p>
      <p>Farage launched the party’s campaign this morning, where he said the party planned to field candidates in every constituency in England, Wales and Scotland in next month’s election.</p>
      <p>However, if Johnson, and other opposition MPs, agreed to a leave alliance he said the Brexit Party would stand aside in some seats.</p>
      <p>Farage also said he would soften his Brexit and agree to a free trade agreement with the EU if an alliance was formed.</p>
      <p>His current position is that the UK must go for a no-deal exit from the EU.</p>
      <p>“Boris Johnson would win a very big majority and on that manifesto we really could get Brexit done,” he said.</p>
      <p>“To quote a friend of mine [US President Donald Trump], we’d become an ‘unstoppable force’.” </p>
