      <p>Scotland is set to be battered with heavy rain this weekend as a yellow <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/bad-weather">weather warning</a> from the Met Office has been issued.</p>
      <p>Persistent and heavy rain on Saturday and into Sunday is likely to bring some disruption from flooding in the north east of the country.</p>
      <p>Angus, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/aberdeen">Aberdeen</a> , Moray. and the Highlands will all be affected with rainfall of up to 80mm expected in some places.</p>
      <p>A Met Office spokesperson said: Persistent and occasionally heavy rain is expected to develop across northeastern Scotland on Saturday.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"Rainfall accumulations of 25 to 40 mm are likely through Aberdeenshire, eastern Moray and northern Angus and as much as 60-80 mm across Easter Ross and Caithness, perhaps a little more over high ground. Rain will lose intensity through Sunday.</p>
      <p>"Flooding of a few homes and businesses is likely. Bus and train services probably affected with journey times taking longer, and spray and flooding on roads probably making journey times longer."</p>
      <p>The yellow weather warning  will be in place from 6am on Saturday morning until noon on Sunday.</p>
      <p>It comes as the Met Office issues "danger to life warnings" for wind and gales for parts of down south. However, Scotland will miss the worst of it.</p>
