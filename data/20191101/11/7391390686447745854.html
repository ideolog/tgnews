      <p>In the world of <i>See</i>, humans lost their sense of sight centuries ago, meaning that they need to use their creativity, resources, and other senses to survive. While some aspects of pre-apocalyptic life are intact — for example, the wealthiest people still have ornate outfits and live in fortresses — most people, like the Alkenny tribe of Jason Momoa's Baba Voss, live strictly off the land. And <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/03/27/apple-tv-plus-jason-momoa-see-vancouver/">the filming locations in Apple TV+'s <i>See</i></a> do this storyline justice.</p>
      <p>Although it looks straight out of a storybook, the <a href="https://www.mypowellrivernow.com/17040/television-production-closes-off-strathcona-park-campground/">series was filmed in Canada between Oct. 2018 and February 2019,</a> according to My Powell River Now. The outlet reported last year that the <i>See</i> production company shut down the Ralph River Campground in <a href="https://www.seetvshownews.com/blog/this-is-why-see-was-filmed-in-vancouver">Strathcona Provincial Park </a>on Vancouver Island in order to film. In addition to that camp ground, Momoa and the series' crew were also spotted around the <a href="https://strathconapark.org/upper-lower-myra-falls/">Campbell River and Myra Falls</a>, also on Vancouver Island, during that time period. The landscape is stunning <i>and</i> accessible to the public when it's not closed for a production company, despite it looking so intimidating and wild in the Apple TV+ series.</p>
      <p>While Vancouver is often referred to <a href="https://www.tourismvancouver.com/media/articles/post/vancouver-is-hollywood-north/">as "Hollywood North</a>" given the amount of projects that film in the British Columbia area, you'd never know <i>See</i> was filmed there unless you were a true Canadian park nerd. It looks <i>that</i> spectacular. That was the point, according to Momoa, who said in an interview with <i>This Morning</i> that the writer and director of <i>See</i>, Steven Knight and Francis Lawrence, respectively, "didn't want to shoot <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUsyBEccPeI">somewhere that they've ever shot before</a>." It paid off as the forests, frozen tundras, and spectacular water elements lend themselves to rounding out this post-apocalyptic universe.</p>

      <p>Not that all of the scenery is totally natural. The <i>Wall Street Journal </i>reports that <i>See</i> cost nearly $15 million per episode to produce, totaling around $120 million for the production of the first season — which is similar to how much <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/12/how-much-it-costs-to-produce-an-episode-of-game-of-thrones.html">HBO spent to make Season 8 of <i>Game of Thrones</i></a>. Much of those production costs went to changing the natural setting, as Momoa told <i>This Morning</i> that "in some of the opening villages they actually drained a lake," and cleared a number of trees that had been growing in the area. "We built a whole village and they filled it back up when we were gone," Momoa added.</p>
      <p>He added that this role is just as unique for him as the filming locations are. Momoa told Uproxx, "I’ve obviously <a href="https://uproxx.com/tv/jason-momoa-interview-see-apple-tv-plus/">played a lot of the action roles</a> and probably dressed and looked the same, but I’ve never — I feel like in a lot of these roles, they’ve been capped at a certain place. Drogo [from <i>Game of Thrones</i>] was never able to get into a fight, he never really went into battle, he never had a baby, like, he just fell in love. Deckland Harp in <i><i>Frontier</i></i>, he never got to see his kids and what it was like beforehand, it was just the death of his kids, and now it’s just his revenge.”</p>
      <p>Between Momoa and the rest of the casts' performances, a compelling (and eerie) story, and breathtaking scenery, <i>See</i> will hopefully live up to its ambitious <i>GoT</i>-style budget.</p>
