      <h1>Bride shamed for wearing teddy bear nappy on her wedding day</h1>
      <h2>A photo of a bride flashing what's under her wedding dress has garnered a lot of attention on social media</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T11:12:40+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 11:12</time> by <a rel="author">Courtney Pochin, https://www.facebook.com/courtneypochinmirror/?modal=admin_todo_tour</a></address>
      <p>On a woman's wedding day, you'd probably expect them to be wearing some lacy lingerie under their dress.</p>
      <p>Perhaps even a garter on their thigh.</p>
      <p>You might not expect to see a bride wearing a nappy, covered in cartoon teddy bears, as she's about to walk down the aisle.</p>
      <p>But a photo of an unnamed bride-to-be lifting up her <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/wedding-dress">white dress</a> and flashing her nappy proudly has been shared on social media.</p>
      <p>And, unsurprisingly <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/weddings">wedding</a> shamers on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> have plenty of thoughts about the look.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>It's unclear why the woman opted to wear the nappy on her big day - it could be that she needs to for a medical reason, such as a weak bladder.</p>
      <p>But this thought didn't cross some people's minds and they have instead accused the bride of having an "adult baby kink" and wearing "teddy-printed fetish diapers".</p>
      <p>After screenshotting the photos from a pal's profile, a woman posted them in a shaming group, writing: "I'm not kinkshaming (okay, maybe I am a little) but is bringing your daddy kink into your wedding just a bit weird?"</p>
      <p>A different user agreed, saying: "That’s not a Daddy kink, that’s an adult baby kink.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Someone else pointed out that if the couple getting married did share a kink, it would have been very "easy" to keep it between themselves.</p>
      <p>"Yeah, maybe just not in public wedding photos," added another person.</p>
      <p>However not everyone thought they should have to hide it.</p>
      <p>Someone else said: "In my mind if it's two people sharing a kink that's getting married, I'd say it's the perfect time and place to incorporate it."</p>
      <p>A sixth user claimed they hadn't even noticed the nappy because they were too busy looking at the "STUNNING" wedding dress.</p>
