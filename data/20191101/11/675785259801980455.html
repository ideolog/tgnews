      <h1>Tutankhamun's 'curse' brings death and destruction - and it's here in the UK</h1>
      <h2>Ever since the boy king's tomb was opened in Egypt in 1923 there have been rumours of the curse</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T11:14:58+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 11:14</time> by <a rel="author">Jane Lavender, https://www.facebook.com/dailymirror/</a></address>
      <p>The boy king Tutankhamun lay mummified for more than 3,000 years under the shifting sands of the Egyptian desert.</p>
      <p>But then, in 1923, archeaologist Howard Carter lifted the lid of the 19-year-old Pharoah's sarcophagus for the first time in three millenia.</p>
      <p>It was a hugely significant moment but ever since Tutankhamun's mummy was found, rumours of a curse have followed in his wake.</p>
      <p>Ruin, the death of the owner of Downton Abbey - struck down by a mosquito bite - suicide and even murder, all can be traced back to the fateful day Carter opened the grave.</p>
      <p>And now Tutankhamun's burial treasures are in the UK, on display on the Saatchi Gallery in London from today.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Of the original party of 58 who discovered the tomb and opened the sarcophagus, eight died almost straight afterwards.</p>
      <p>Sherlock Homes creater, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, blamed their deaths on 'elementals', which he says were created by the Pharoah's priests to guard his final resting place.</p>
      <p>The first time the 'curse' struck was in the minutes after Carter opened the tomb.</p>
      <p>The archeaologist is said to have sent a messanger on an errand to his home.</p>
      <p>But whenthe boy was close to his destination he is said to have heard a "faint, almost human cry".</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>As he reached the front door he saw a cobra snake inside a bird cage with a pet canary in its mouth.</p>
      <p>It is said Carter's home had been broken into by the Royal Cobra, a symbol worn by the Pharoah on his head to strike down his enemies.</p>
      <p>This ws followed just weeks later by the strange and mysterious death of the man who had funded the expedition to open Tutankhamun's tomb, Lord Carnarvon.</p>
      <p>He lived in Highclere castle, the real life location of Downton Abbey, and four months and seven days after the sarcophagus was opened he was found dead.</p>
      <p>Lord Carnarvon had been bitten by a mosquito while he was in Egypt and he aggravated the bite while he was shaving.</p>

      <p>It became infected and he passed away.</p>
      <p>The following month, US railway executive George Jay Gould I visited Tutankhamun's tomb - and paid with his life.</p>
      <p>He developed a fever and succumbed to his illness while on the French Riviera.</p>
      <p>The deaths didn't end there.</p>
      <p>Prince Ali Kamel of Egypt visited the tomb on arguably his country's most famous ruler in July.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Shortly after he was pictured on his visit, he was shot dead by his wife.</p>
      <p>If the Carnarvon family thought the 'curse' had died along with the man who had funded the evacuation, they were very wrong.</p>
      <p>The Lord's brother, Colonel The Hon Aubrey Herbert MP suddenly went almost blind.</p>
      <p>In September, 1923, he underwent a dental procedure that medics thought would restore his sight.</p>
      <p>Instead, he developed blood poisoning and died.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Just a year later, the radiologist who had X-rayed Tutankhamun's mummy after the sarcophagus was opened, Sir Archibald Douglas Reid, died from a mystery illness.</p>
      <p>Sir Lee Stack, Governor General of Sudan, had been open of the first people to visit the tomb after it was opened.</p>
      <p>But in 1925 he was shot while he drove through Cairo.</p>
      <p>The same year, Carter's friend, Sir Bruce Ingham, was given a chilling gift that has been said to have led to his almost ruin.</p>
      <p>It was a paperweight made of a mummified gand. On its wrist was a bracelet carved with the words 'cursed be he who moves my body - to him shall come fire, water and pestilence'.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Shortly after he accepted the gift, Sir Bruce's home burned down, only to be flooded when he had it rebuilt.</p>
      <p>And the 'curse' kept claiming its victims.</p>
      <p>In 1928 AC Mace died from arsenic poisoning. He had been part of Carter's excavaction team when the tomb was opened and his accounts of what happened had been widely studied.</p>
      <p>The Carnarvon family could not escape the 'curse' of the boy king.</p>
      <p>Lord Carnavon's half brother, Mervyn Herbert, passed away in 1929 from malarial pneumonia.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Those close to Howard Carter were also not safe when his personal secretary, Richard Bethell, was smothered in his bed the same year.</p>
      <p>Just three months later Richard's father, Richard Luttrell Pilkington Bethell,  died when he threw himself from his seventh floor apartment.</p>
      <p>This was the room Tutankhamun's burial treasures were being kept in.</p>
      <p>He left a note that read, "I really cannot stand any more horrors and hardly see what good I am going to do here, so I am making my exit."</p>
      <p>And then there was the death of the man who had first opened the tomb, Howard Carter.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>He passed away on March 2, 1939, from Hodgkin's Lymphoma.</p>
      <p>The epitaph on his grave reads: "May your spirit live, may you spend millions of years, you who love Thebes, sitting with your face to the north wind, your eyes beholding happiness."</p>
      <p>Chillingly, this is a quote taken from the Wishing Cup of Tutankhamun.</p>
      <p>Despite the rafts of deaths, experts are still unconvinced the 'curse' is real.</p>
      <p>A 2002 study, carried out by the British Medical Journal looked at the 44 people said to be with Carter when he opened the tomb.</p>

      </figure>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The average age of death for that group was considered normal.</p>
      <p>It has even been claimed that Carter himself started the rumour of the 'curse' to keep people away from the tomb.</p>
      <p>But will you be brave enough to visit the exhibition when it opens on November 2?</p>
      <p>It will contain more than 150 artefacts and is the largest ever collection to travel outside Egypt.</p>
      <p>Director of the Saatchi Gallery, Philippa Adams, said: "The discovery of Tutankhamun’s tomb is a timeless story known throughout the world, and this exhibition will present these important historical artefacts in a highly innovative way through immersive displays.</p>
      <p>"We are thrilled and honoured to be hosting this culturally significant exhibition."</p>
      <p>The collection will be displayed at the Saatchi Gallery on the Kings Road from 2 November,before 'Tutankhamun: Treasures of the Golden Pharaoh', continues on it's world tour.</p>
