        <b>The Rapid Action Battalion has started two separate cases against DSCC councillor Moinul Haque Monju on illegal arms and drugs charges.</b>
      </p>
      <p>RAB 3's Nayeb Subedar Ibrahim Hossain initiated the cases with Wari Police Station on Thursday following Monju's arrest for alleged extortion.</p>
      <p>RAB later placed Monju, the councillor of ward No. 39, into the custody of police, said Wari Police Sub-Inspector Milon Chatterjee.</p>
      <p>Monju is the lone suspect in the arms case while the elite police unit implicated his driver 'Sajjad' alongside him in the drugs case, according to the police.</p>
      <p>Monju, the councillor of ward No. 39, is an 'honorary member' of the Awami League's Wari unit. He was also a member of the ruling party's Dhaka metropolitan committee.</p>

      <p>Monju grabbed the headlines at different times for alleged extortion at Tikatuli's Rajdhani Supermarket and New Rajdhani Supermarket, land grabbing and running a drug cartel. He has, however, consistently denied these allegations.</p>
      <p>But Monju once again came under the spotlight after the government launched a drive to eliminate corruption within the ranks of the Awami League and its affiliate organisations.</p>
      <p>He is also among the 21 councillors to have been served show-cause notices by the DSCC for their repeated absence from meetings.</p>
      <p>A businessman named Kazi Md Rony from the Rajdhani Supermarket started a case with the Wari police on Wednesday, according to the RAB.</p>
      <p>Councillor Monju had demanded Tk 200,000 from him and threatened him if he would not pay the money, said Rony in the complaint.</p>
      <p>RAB looked into the complaint and uncovered a host of other allegations against Monju in the process, prompting raids on his offices and home in Tikatuli on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The law enforcement agency subsequently seized two firearms, liquor, cannabis, yaba pills, Phensedyl and sexual stimulants from his residence.</p>
