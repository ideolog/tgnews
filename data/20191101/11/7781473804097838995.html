      <p>The Datsun Redi-Go scored one-star in the sixth round of the Global NCAP crash test 2019 of India made cars. The hatchback was tested for the full-frontal crash test and the Redi-Go on test was the entry-level trim equipped with driver airbag and ABS as standard. The test was conducted in early 2019 whereas the company updated the hatchback in July with rear parking sensors, a speed warning and seat belt reminder to comply with AIS-145 norms.</p>

      <p>The body shell and the footwell of the Redi-Go were rated 'unstable'. The head protection for the passenger was good while the head protection for driver was adequate due to the steering wheel displacement. The chest protection for the driver was weak and was marginal for the passenger. It was also brought to notice that the Redi-Go was not equipped with a 3-point seatbelt with automatic retractors for all occupants.</p>

      <p>The child occupant protection showed poor results as well. The head of the 18-month-old dummy collided with the front seat and the exposed head of the 3-year-old dummy during the impact was the main reason for low ratings.</p>

      <p>The Datsun Redi-GO hatchback is due for an upgrade and is expected to be out before March 2020. Given the low crash test ratings, the next-generation Redi-Go hatchback is expected to be based on a much safer platform. Also, the engine is expected to go under necessary revision considering the deadline to meet the upcoming BSVI norms is closing in.</p>
