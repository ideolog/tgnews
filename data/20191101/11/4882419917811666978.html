      <p>Former Barcelona player Javier Mascherano is one of the players being targetted by new Major League Soccer franchise Inter Miami, who are owned by David Beckham.</p>
      <p>Reports in Argentina this week have suggested that the Argentine midfielder, who left Bar√ßa for Hebei Fortune in the Chinese Super League, is now looking for a new challenge with his contract set to expire.</p>
      <p>Journalist Cesar Luis Merlo reported that Inter Miami are keen on him and SPORT have been able to confirm that there is an offer on the table.</p>
      <p>A source close to Mascherano has said there the American side have made contact and that he is "close" to signing a deal with Beckham's franchise, who will join MLS in 2020.</p>
      <p>At 35, there's an element of risk to signing Mascherano, who's best days are behind him. However, he offers experience and character to a relatively young team that is being constructed.</p>
      <p>So far, Inter Miami have announced five signings but they have not named a coach. It's been speculated that former Real Madrid coach Santiago Solari is an option.</p>
