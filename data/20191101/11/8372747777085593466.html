      <p>YUMA, Ariz. â€” Arizona police are investigating after a 3-year-old <a href="https://www.abc15.com/news/region-central-southern-az/yuma/yuma-child-hospitalized-after-eating-suspicious-candy">child was hospitalized after ingesting suspicious Halloween candy.</a></p>
      <p>Officials received word of the incident before 9 p.m. Thursday when the child displayed abnormal behavior after eating some candy. Police say the child was lethargic, had dilated pupils and was acting out of the ordinary.</p>
      <p>Officers checked all of their Halloween candy and found an unwrapped red gummy-type candy in their bucket. The candy reportedly resembled a red fish-shaped candy known to be laced with Tetrahydrocannabinol, also known as THC.</p>
      <p>The candy was collected by officials and will be sent for testing.</p>
      <p>The family reportedly took part in the Trick or Treat Main Street event and Safe Trick or Treat at the Yuma Fairgrounds.</p>
      <p>Police are asking parents to go through the Halloween candy their children collected and check for unwrapped or red gummy items that resemble a fish.</p>
      <p>The Yuma Police Department encourages anyone with any information about this incident to please call the Yuma Police Department at 928-373-4700 or 928-782-7463 to remain anonymous.</p>
      <p>Authorities also issued a warning to parents Halloween night after <a href="https://www.abc15.com/news/region-west-valley/litchfield-park/mcso-reports-of-contaminated-candy-found-in-the-west-valley">receiving reports of "contaminated candy" in the West Valley.</a></p>
