      <h1>Nicki Minaj flashes her $1.1 million wedding ring on Instagram</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T11:46:04+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 11:46</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/5607/entertainment-desk/" target="_blank">Entertainment Desk</a></address>
      <p>Rapper Nicki Minhaj is not shy showing off her luxuries and her wedding ring is certainly no exception.</p>
      <p>The 36-year old star recently tied the knot with husband Kenneth Patty, where the couple posted a picture on Halloween. Minaj was dressed as the bride of Chucky.</p>
      <p>Prominent in all the couple’s images were their chunky new diamond rings in honor of their recent rushed nuptials, which the<i> Chun-Li</i> star tagged as having been designed by Rafaello And Co.</p>

      <p><i>TMZ</i> reported that Patty, 41, was involved in the designing process for his superstar wife’s ring across a multitude of steps. The square jewel took several months to complete.</p>
      <p>The jewelers at Rafaello stated that Petty, who is a registered sex offender due to a rape charge involving an underage girl, paid an estimated $1.1 million in payment for the ring. The custom piece is also reported to be a 17-carat centre with VVS2-clarity diamonds.</p>

      <p>In another selfie video posted recently, Minaj is seen cuddled up with Petty, and it’s clear she wants both their rings to be front and center in the clip.</p>

      <p>In terms of Kenneth’s band, which is also thick with encrusted jewels, <i>TMZ</i> reported it’s customized with the words ‘Ken &amp; Barbie’ on the inside of the ring. The singer apparently doesn’t have an inscription, because there was no room for one.</p>

      <p>The jeweler from Rafaello reportedly flew from New York to Los Angeles a few days before Minaj’s rushed wedding last week to deliver the rings, which came in a customized jewelry box with a screen on the inside of the lid that plays a slideshow of the couple to the tune of the rapper’s song <i>Come See About Me</i>.</p>
