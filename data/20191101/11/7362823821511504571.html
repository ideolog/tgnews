      <p>A <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/russia">Russian man</a> is facing five years in prison for allegedly <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/pets">using a cat</a> as a weapon to attack a police officer in Moscow, local media is reporting.</p>
      <p>Gennady Scherbakov, 59, was reportedly heavily drunk when he grabbed a feline that was nearby, shook it and threw it at an officer in October of last year, when he was responding to noise complaints from residents.</p>
      <p>The unique altercation left the officer "seriously scratched" in the face, according to Russian broadcaster Ren TV.</p>

      <p>Residents in the area had reported a disturbance at an apartment block in the city, but when the officer responded to the property, Scherbakov refused to answer any questions, according to the outlet.</p>
      <p>Scherbakov, who was sitting at the foot of a stairwell in a residential building, grabbed a cat by the shoulder blades and threw it at the policeman. The feline reportedly stuck to the officer's face, sinking its claws in.</p>
      <p>The officer reportedly suffered "physical pain, moral harm and multiple scratches on the left side of his face," according to <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/cat-attack-police-officer-face-scratch-moscow-russia-a9179446.html">the Independent</a>.</p>

      <p>Scherbakov denies perpetrating the attack and claims the cat launched at the officer all on its own.</p>
      <p>A former prosecutor told the website <a href="https://zona.media/news/2019/10/30/koshka">Mediazona</a> that the case was opened nearly a year after the incident took place in order "to blame the district prosecutor for poor supervision of the investigation."</p>

      <p>Scherbakov faces criminal charges of violence against police, which carries a maximum sentence of five-year imprisonment, and a fine of 200,000 rubles ($3,125).</p>
      <p>It's not clear what happened to the cat.</p>
