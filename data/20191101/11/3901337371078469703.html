      <p>Neymar was strongly linked with a move away from the reigning Ligue 1 champions at the beginning of the season, but saw a potential return to FC Barcelona collapse, but former Brazil international Rivaldo believes the 27-year-old should persist in his attempts to leave the club.</p>
      <p>"I believe a lot in Neymar. But I think he has to leave," Rivaldo said, as per <i>Sky Sports.</i></p>
      <p>"That's why he wanted to leave at this transfer window at any cost, PSG is a great club but not one for the level of Neymar.</p>
      <p>"I think that, at a world stage, everybody talks only about Barcelona, Real Madrid and some other big clubs from England, some from Germany.</p>

      <p>"He has to go to a club that has more history at Champions (League).</p>
      <p>"Of course, if he wins the Champions (League) and can be a world champion, it will be much easier to become the best player in the world.</p>
      <p>"He has to be like Ronaldinho. Ronaldinho left there (PSG) to come to Barcelona to be the best player in the world. But he still has time, he's 27 years old, a lot of things ahead of him.</p>
      <p>"He almost left this year and I believe he will leave at the next transfer window. And he will be the best player in the world."</p>
