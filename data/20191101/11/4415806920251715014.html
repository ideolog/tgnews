      <p>Irish band The Script have announced that they will come to Cork next year as part of their European tour to promote their Sunsets and Full Moons album.</p>
      <p>The trio are playing at Musgrave Park on June 23 with tickets going on sale next Friday (November 8).</p>
      <p>“I think it’s the most poignant record we’ve ever made,” said lead singer Danny O’Donoghue.</p>
      <p>“Our music was always about being together with the audience, and writing about your own feelings, and sharing them.”</p>
      <p>Guitarist Mark Sheehan added that the album is the band doing what they do best.</p>
      <p>“No frills, no production, just us playing as a band,” he said.</p>
      <p>Before playing in Cork in the summer, The Script play in Belfast in March before three shows at Dublin's 3Arena on March 5, 6, and 7.</p>
      <p>English singer-songwriter Becky Hill will be the special guest at Musgrave Park.</p>
