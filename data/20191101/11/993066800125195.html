      <p>Mariah Carey has reminded her fans that Christmas is imminent with a fun video showing herself getting ready for the festive season.</p>
      <p>The singer, whose hit single All I Want For Christmas Is You is considered one of the best seasonal songs of all time, posted a clip of herself falling asleep on Halloween while dressed in a 1980s-style costume on social media.</p>
      <p>The music star’s phone showed the time to be 11.59pm on October 31, before switching over to midnight on November 1.</p>

      <p>Carey then pretended to wake up in bed wearing red Christmas-themed pyjamas while receiving a phone call from Santa.</p>
      <p>She sang down the phone: “It’s time!”</p>
      <p>Earlier in the day, Carey had celebrated Halloween in her 1980s glam rock-style costume at Heidi Klum’s annual bash in New York.</p>

      <p>The jovial clip came as music streaming service Deezer revealed All I Want For Christmas Is You is still the UK’s festive favourite, 25 years after its release.</p>
      <p>The song has already seen a 99% surge in streaming throughout October.</p>
      <p>It was the nation’s most-played Christmas song in 2017 and 2018, fending off competition from classics Last Christmas by Wham! and Merry Christmas Everyone by Shakin’ Stevens.</p>
      <p>Deezer has also reported that British music fans are getting into the festive spirit early this year, with streams of its Christmas Songs playlist rising by 111% in October.</p>
      <p>To celebrate the anniversary of her 1994 album Merry Christmas, Carey has released a special 25th anniversary edition.</p>
      <p>The double album, which includes a number of rare remixes and previously unreleased live tracks from her 1994 St John the Divine concert, is available now.</p>
