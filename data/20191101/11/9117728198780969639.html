        <b><a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/nico-hulkenberg">Nico Hulkenberg</a> is currently without a seat in Formula 1 for next season. The German is being replaced by Esteban Ocon at <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/renault-f1-team">Renault</a> and his options for another seat are diminishing rapidly. One option was for Hulkenberg to go to <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/williams">Williams</a> but he doesn't think that is the right choice. </b>

      <p><i>“I think they need somebody else," </i>Hulkenberg said to <i><a href="https://motorsportweek.com/news/id/25056">Motorsportweek</a> </i>when asked about a seat at Williams. </p>

        <i>“I think I’m not the right person, the right driver for them. Not that at all, it’s just where I am in my career, where they are, and the timings, I just don’t think it’s the right timing for us.</i>

      <p>Hulkenberg is regarded as one of the fastest drivers not in a top team and is unlucky not to have been given a chance to prove himself. </p>
      <p><i>“I’ve performed well over the years, very consistently, many times when it was on the verge or other people didn’t get hired or get a job, I still was wanted and hired and paid to drive,”</i> he said.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“That also speaks for some quality. Of course, I would like to have a different kind of record, more points and podiums and victories, but yeah, I know the reasons why, and why maybe things didn’t go that way.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“I’m at peace with myself there. I sleep well at night with my eyes closed. I’d love to continue racing, but if not, then life goes on.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>Hulkenberg will assess his options at the end of the season and unfortunately for him he may be forced to hang up his Formula 1 hopes. </p>
