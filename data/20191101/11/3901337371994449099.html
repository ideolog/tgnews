      <p>Orlando Pirates goalkeeper, Wayne Sandilands, has shared a different perspective on how the Soweto Derby is seen and treated in South African football. </p>
      <p>While the multitudes in the fraternity are buzzing about the eagerly awaitedcup tie between Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates, Sandilands has warned about not focusing on just one match as his team is still working on a resurgence after a disappointing start to the season.</p>

      <p>Sandilands and his Pirates teammates will face Chiefs at the Moses Mabhida Stadium in their Telkom Knockout quarter-final clash this Saturday. </p>
      <p>“About the timing I don’t know…Chiefs is – yes it’s the derby – but I think I’ve said this many times before, I think as an athlete if you start really placing a lot of attention on certain games, it’s not a good thing,” Sandilands told the Siya crew. </p>

      <p>“Yes, the derby is different, yes there’s a lot of hype about it but if the mind starts to focus on anything other than just the game of football and 90 minutes you sort of treading on thin ice. So, right now, for me I’m playing now and there’s another game coming up and the focus is again just on hoping the team as a collective can do well and win matches," the shot-stopper added.  </p>
