      <p>MASSAPEQUA PARK, Long Island (WABC) -- Police in Nassau County released more images in the search for the gunmen who fired into a home in Massapequa Park.</p>
      <p>Police released a photo of a person-of-interest who was on the property at Glengariff Road and Manhattan Avenue when the <a href="https://abc7ny.com/shots-fired-into-long-island-home-while-residents-slept/5653801/">shots rang out early Monday</a>.</p>
      <p>The bullets barely missed the people sleeping inside.</p>
      <p>Investigators believe there were two gunmen, who both fired several rounds, and then fled.</p>

      <p>Fortunately, no one was injured.</p>
      <p>It was not immediately clear who the man was or why he would have been targeted.</p>
      <p>Detectives request anyone with information regarding the above incident to contact Nassau County Crime Stoppers at 1-800-244-TIPS or the Seventh Squad at 516-573-6753. All callers will remain anonymous.</p>
