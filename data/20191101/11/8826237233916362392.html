      <h1>Here Are the 10 'Most Urgent' Cases of Threats to Press Freedom Around the World</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T11:05:00+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 11:05</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://time.com/author/time-staff/" target="_blank">TIME Staff</a></address>
      <p>More than a year after he was killed inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, the case of journalist <a href="https://time.com/5428159/jamal-khashoggi-murder/">Jamal Khashoggi</a> remains at the top of a list of the most serious threats to press freedom.</p>
      <p>The list — released each month by the <a href="https://www.onefreepresscoalition.com/">One Free Press Coalition</a>, which was created by a <a href="https://time.com/5541286/one-free-press-10-most-urgent-journalists/">dozen news organizations</a>, including TIME, with the goal of defending journalists under attack — identifies ten of the most severe cases of threats to press freedom around the world.</p>
      <p>Khashoggi, a columnist for the Washington <i>Post</i> who had criticized Saudi Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman, was killed inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2, 2018. He was among the four journalists and one news organization named <a href="https://time.com/person-of-the-year-2018-the-guardians/">The Guardians</a> as the TIME 2018 Person of the Year, recognized for his work in the face of serious threats to journalistic freedom.</p>
      <p>Khashoggi’s death has remained a controversial topic in the thirteen months since he was killed. Despite findings from the CIA concluding that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/cia-concludes-saudi-crown-prince-ordered-jamal-khashoggis-assassination/2018/11/16/98c89fe6-e9b2-11e8-a939-9469f1166f9d_story.html">bin Salman ordered Khashoggi’s killing</a> and a United Nations <a href="https://time.com/5609884/jamal-khashoggi-killing-united-nations-report/">special report</a> that found “credible evidence” calling for a deeper investigation into bin Salman’s role in the assassination, President Donald Trump has been criticized for his muted response over the murder and continuing to <a href="https://time.com/5601097/jamal-khashoggi-murder-nuclear-information-saudi-arabia/">maintain ties with Saudi Arabia</a>.</p>
      <p>Bin Salman said he takes “full responsibility” for Khashoggi’s murder, but denied ordering the killing in an <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/highlights-from-this-weeks-mohammad-bin-salman-interview-on-60-minutes-2019-09-29/">interview with <i>60 Minutes</i></a> in September.</p>
      <p>Other journalists on the list who have come under threat include an imprisoned reporter in Egypt who has been tortured and a detained Uzbek blogger.</p>
