      <p>Police have urged two brothers wanted over the deaths of 39 people inside a lorry trailer in Essex to hand themselves in.</p>
      <p>Essex Police called on Ronan Hughes and Christopher Hughes to go to their nearest police station to help officers investigating the discovery of the bodies last month.</p>
      <p>“Today I want to make a direct appeal – Ronan and Christopher, hand yourselves in to the Police Service of Northern Ireland,” said Detective Chief Inspector Daniel Stoten.</p>
      <p>“We need you both to come forward and assist this investigation.”</p>
      <p>Stoten said police have spoken with Ronan Hughes over the phone, but added: “We need to have a conversation with him and his brother in person.</p>
      <p>“Talking to Ronan and Christopher is crucial to our investigation and the sooner we can make this happen the sooner we can progress and continue with our investigation.”</p>
      <p>Essex Police first put out an appeal for information for the brothers earlier this week.</p>
