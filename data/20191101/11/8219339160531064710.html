      <h1>Complaints of iOS 13.2 killing background apps, ‘doesn’t multitask any more’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T11:24:00+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 11:24</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5mac.com/author/benlovejoy/" target="_blank">Ben Lovejoy</a></address>
      <p>There are multiple complaints of <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/ios-13/">iOS 13.2</a> killing background apps ‘so aggressively that iOS effectively doesn’t offer multitasking anymore.’ The latest iOS update was <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/10/28/ios-13-2-now-available-emoji-more/">released on Monday</a>, adding Deep Fusion, new emoji, Siri privacy settings and more.</p>
      <p>Overcast developer <a href="https://twitter.com/marcoarment/status/1189899504562122752">Marco Arment</a> made the complaint on Twitter, with many others echoing his experience …</p>
      <blockquote>Major new bugs introduced in iOS 13.2:<br/><br/>    •  Background downloads often hang forever and never run<br/>    •  Apps get killed in the background so aggressively that iOS effectively doesn’t offer multitasking anymore<br/><br/>This continues the iOS 13 pattern of breaking long-held basic functionality.</blockquote>
      <p>He goes on to suggest that Apple is not allowing its own developers enough time to identify and fix bugs before updates are released.</p>
      <blockquote>I’m sure Apple has good excuses about why their software quality is so sh*tty again. I hear the same thing over and over from people inside: They aren’t given enough time to fix bugs.<br/><br/>Your software quality is broken, Apple. Deeply, systemically broken. Get your sh*t together.</blockquote>
      <p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/"><i>Daring Fireball’s</i></a> John Gruber says the same happens to him.</p>
      <blockquote>This bug where apps are getting killed soon after they’re backgrounded is driving me nuts. Start a YouTube video in Safari, switch to another app, go back to Safari  —  and the video loads from scratch and starts from the beginning.</blockquote>
      <p>Others report the same experience in replies to Arment’s tweet.</p>
      <blockquote>This happens on my iPad Pro, and it’s the one with 6 GB of RAM. Infuriating!!<br/><br/>And mail hangs. Had to reboot to get mail to download.<br/><br/>Yup. If I pause @OvercastFM to make a phone call, iOS kills it so the system media playback controls revert to the music app. Not great.<br/><br/>The WebView for example in Twitter kills itself and reloads the page a lot since 13.2 on my phone.<br/><br/>Very noticeable in Mail. Messages don’t arrive until I open the app.<br/><br/>And here I thought pausing Overcast with my AirPods and then having to relaunch Overcast to play again was a Marco bug. Then I “alt+tabbed” from safari to a password manager and the webpage reloaded and I realized it’s the OS.<br/><br/>Yeah. This is background downloads for everything! I needed to update to the release 13.2, and had to restart my phone to get it to actually download.</blockquote>
      <p>Quite a few others complain of blank webpages in Safari, the content only loading in Reader view.</p>
