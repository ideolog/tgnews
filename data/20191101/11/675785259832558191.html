      <p>A man told a traffic warden "You better watch your back; I stalk, I hunt, I kill", after he was slapped with a parking ticket, a court has heard.</p>
      <p>Unemployed Blaine McCarthy launched a tirade of abuse when he saw a penalty notice being placed on his white Transit van parked outside a Travelodge in Carlisle.</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old appeared at Teesside Magistrates’ Court where he pleaded guilty to using threatening, abusive, insulting words or behaviour during the incident in March this year, <a href="https://www.gazettelive.co.uk/">Gazette Live</a> reports.</p>
      <p>Paul Doney, prosecuting, said a parking ticket was displayed in the vehicle but it had been expired for 15 minutes.</p>

      <p>"Two parking wardens were carrying out their regular duties when they noticed the van had an invalid ticket," Mr Doney said.</p>
      <p>"The officers began taking photos and issued a penalty notice when two men appeared, one being the defendant, who shouted 'Oi, that's my van, what the f*** are you doing?'."</p>
      <p>The court heard how the warden went on to explain it was "too late" as a ticket had already been issued.</p>
      <p>However, the defendant then subjected the wardens to a torrent of abuse and made threats towards them.</p>
      <p>It was heard that McCarthy paced around the two workers and got "right up to one of them".</p>

      <p>"Both were very angry and aggressive," Mr Doney said.</p>
      <p>The court heard how the wardens began to walk away but McCarthy continued to shout abuse.</p>
      <p>Mr Doney added: "The defendant then told the warden, 'You better watch your back; I stalk, I hunt, I kill'."</p>
      <p>In mitigation, the court heard McCarthy acted "in the heat of the moment" and did not intend to cause anyone any harm or fear.</p>
      <p>"He lost his temper and acted on impulse," his solicitor said.</p>
      <p>"He accepts his behaviour wasn't appropriate in the circumstances and that a number of choice words were used which would have caused the wardens to feel fearful."</p>
      <p>McCarthy has three convictions for 11 offences on his record.</p>
      <p>McCarthy, of Blackhall Sands, Acklam, was fined £80 and ordered to pay £50 compensation to each of the traffic wardens.</p>
