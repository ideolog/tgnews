      <p>The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has issued a court enforceable order that will allow some <i>Fallout 76</i> customers to receive refunds.</p>
      <p>The consumer watchdog made <a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/media-release/zenimax-to-refund-consumers-for-the-fallout-76-game?fbclid=IwAR3PAWfNkAaGR57t-tFqzqCNdiHNYkKrmIjZ9JTUCQ8sSWoGtXny65OnN0Y">this announcement</a> off the back of Bethesda's parent company, ZeniMax Media, admitting to misleading customers about their consumer rights.</p>
      <p>Some customers complained to the ACCC after being told by ZeniMax representatives that they weren't entitled to a refund, despite experiencing faults with the game.</p>
      <p>Some of the reported problems included server issues, lag and various graphic and visual problems.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/public-registers/undertakings-registers/zenimax-media-inc-zenimax-europe-limited-and-zenimax-australia-pty-ltd">ZeniMax's undertaking from the ACC</a> states that customer support representatives and some online documents implied to Fallout 76 customers that Australians had no right to a refund if they purchased the game from the Bethesda Store or through a third party retailer.</p>
      <p>"ZeniMax has acknowledged that they are likely to have misled certain Australian consumers about their rights to a refund when they experienced faults with their <i>Fallout 76</i> game," said ACCC Commissioner Sarah Court.</p>
      <p>Ms Court went on to state that retailers need to make sure that their refunds and returns policies are aligned with Australian consumer law.</p>
      <p>"When a consumer has purchased a product that has a fault which amounts to a major failure, the Australian Consumer Law provides them with the right to ask for their choice of either a repair, replacement or refund."</p>
      <p>ZeniMax will now offer refunds to customers who contacted them about <i>Fallout 76</i> issues between 24 November 2018 and 1 June 2019. Anyone who accepts this refund will no longer have access to the game.</p>
      <p>Issues with the game have been reported widely ever since its release in 2018, <a href="https://www.kotaku.com.au/2018/10/fallout-76-bug-accidentally-deletes-entire-50gb-beta/">from a bug that deleted the entire 50GB beta</a>, to another that allowed players <a href="https://www.kotaku.com.au/2018/12/fallout-76-bethesda-latest-bug-users-seeing-other-peoples-support-tickets/">to see other people's support tickets</a>.</p>
      <p>Patch 11, which arrived in July 2019 <a href="https://www.kotaku.com.au/2019/07/bug-riddled-update-shows-why-fallout-76-needs-a-public-test-server/">was also riddled with bugs</a>, which renewed calls for a public test server for the game.</p>
      <p>Kotaku Australia has reached out to ZeniMax Australia for comment and will update this story if we hear back.</p>
