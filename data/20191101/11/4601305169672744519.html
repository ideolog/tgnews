      <h1>AI plays StarCraft II at "Grandmaster" level</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T11:55:05+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 11:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://boingboing.net/author/rob_beschizza" target="_blank">Rob Beschizza</a></address>
      <p>AlphaStar is reportedly <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/AlphaStar-Grandmaster-level-in-StarCraft-II-using-multi-agent-reinforcement-learning">the first artificial intelligence to play the computer game StarCraft II at a "Grandmaster" level</a> under standard competitive conditions.</p>
      <blockquote>1. AlphaStar now has the same kind of constraints that humans play under – including viewing the world through a camera, and stronger limits on the frequency of its actions* (in collaboration with StarCraft professional Dario “TLO” Wünsch). <br/><br/>2. AlphaStar can now play in one-on-one matches as and against Protoss, Terran, and Zerg – the three races present in StarCraft II. Each of the Protoss, Terran, and Zerg agents is a single neural network.<br/><br/>3. The League training is fully automated, and starts only with agents trained by supervised learning, rather than from previously trained agents from past experiments.<br/><br/>4. AlphaStar played on the official game server, Battle.net, using the same maps and conditions as human players. All game replays are available here.</blockquote>
      <p>It's all thanks to multi-agent reinforcement learning. <i>*nods authoritatively*</i></p>
