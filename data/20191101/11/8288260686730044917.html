      <p>UFC fighter Conor McGregor is to enter a guilty plea in court in connection with an incident at a pub in Dublin.</p>
      <p>The mixed martial arts star is facing a single charge of assault.</p>
      <p>Dublin District Court was told that the 31-year-old, of Lady Castle, Straffan, Co Kildare, is to plead guilty to the offence.</p>
      <p>The court heard that the victim, Desmond Keogh, did not want to give a victim impact statement.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The victim has accepted an apology from the accused, the court was told.</p>
      <p>Dublin District Court previously heard that the 31-year-old, of Lady Castle, Straffan, Co Kildare, is accused of assaulting Desmond Keogh at the Marble Arch pub in Drimnagh on April 6, where McGregor was promoting his brand of whisky.</p>
      <p>CCTV footage from the night emerged last August and had been widely shared on social media.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The judge remanded McGregor on continuing bail at his last hearing and he is expected to either make a plea or contest the charge when he returns to court later today.</p>
      <p>Speaking about the incident previously, McGregor said: "Whatever comes my way, I will face it. Whatever comes my way, I deserve it. I will face this head on. I will not hide from it."</p>
      <p>McGregor announced his retirement from mixed martial arts in March but later hinted on social media he was ready to reverse that decision.</p>
