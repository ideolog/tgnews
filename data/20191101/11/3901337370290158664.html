          <b>Pirates’ New Star Chiefs Might Have To Worry About </b>
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>Chippa are finalising their preparations to host Sundowns in their Telkom Knockout quarter-final match at Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium on Sunday, and word coming out of the Eastern Cape outfit’s camp is that Mashaba is struggling with an injury.</p>
      <p>Mashaba was instrumental in helping the Chilli Boys overcome Bloemfontein Celtic in the previous round of the competition. </p>

      </p>
      <p>The 30-year-old versatile player had been without a club for almost two years, before he surfaced at Chippa this season, and has looked impressive with his performances. </p>
      <p>Earlier in the season, when Chippa drew 1-1 with Downs in the league, Mashaba didn't play as he was an unused substitute for ex-Chilli Boys' coach Clinton Larsen.   </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, it has also been confirmed from the Port Elizabeth club that former Orlando Pirates star Thabo Rakhale has also been struggling with an injury.</p>
      <p>Both players missed the team's most recent Absa Premiership match – the 2-0 loss against Highlands Park last weekend.</p>
