      <p>The Court of Appeal, Ibadan, on Friday dismissed a petition filed by the former Governor of Oyo State, Abiola Ajimobi, challenging the verdict of the Election Petition Tribunal on February 23 the senatorial election for Oyo South.</p>
      <p>The Election Petition Tribunal had upheld the victory of Kola Balogun (Oyo South).</p>
      <p>Mr Balogun polled a total of 105,720 votes to defect Mr Ajimobi who had 92,218 votes.</p>
      <p>Delivering judgment, Justice Haruna Tsammani, dismissed Mr Ajimobi’s petition for lacking in merit.</p>
      <p>Mr Tsammani affirmed the decision of the tribunal, adding that the tribunal was right in its judgment.</p>

      <p>The judge held that the petitioner did not have the right to raise the issue of non-qualification of the respondent based on the conduct of PDP primary.</p>
      <p>He further held that a person that does not participate in a party primary does not have the right to challenge the outcome of the primary.</p>
      <p>Mr Tsammani said a person is qualified to contest once such a person satisfied the condition of the party and INEC confirmed such a person.</p>
      <p>The judge said most of the witnesses presented by the petitioner were not qualified to tender exhibits and give evidence because they are not the maker of those documents tendered.</p>
      <p>He said the tribunal was right in upholding the victory of Balogun and dismissed the petition. (NAN)</p>
