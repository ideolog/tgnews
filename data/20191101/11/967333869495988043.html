      <p>Hareem Shah, who has made a name for herself by making videos featuring famous personalities on Tik Tok, has now claimed to have recorded a video of a “famous <a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201910311077189277-pakistan-violated-vienna-convention-intl-court-of-justice-tells-un-assembly/">Pakistani</a> cricketer” allegedly exposing himself to her while he masturbated.</p>
      <p>Shah took to her Twitter handle to reveal it while claiming to have recorded the video of the cricketer with his face visible in it.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://sputniknews.com/viral/201910231077128852-pakistan-tik-tok-queen-occupies-pms-chair-draws-twitteratis-fury/">Tik tok star</a> seems to be threatening the alleged cricketer with a different kind of negative exposure: on social media. She has withheld the player’s name. </p>
