        <b>WASHINGTON (Sputnik) - A US judge decided on Friday that the court-imposed bail condition on businessman Igor Fruman should remain in place without being changed, the US Attorney's Office for the 7th District of New York spokesperson said.</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>"The judge decided that the bail condition will remain as is," the spokesperson said on Friday.</blockquote>
      <p>The bail condition placed on Fruman includes that he is in home detention under electronic monitoring and pays a $1 million bond.</p>
      <p>Fruman is an associate of President Donald Trump’s lawyer Rudy Giuliani, who allegedly helped Giuliani investigate <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201910281077162120-unfortunate-son-muddied-waters-of-ukraines-gas-company-burisma-hunter-bidens-quid-pro-quo/">corruption</a> by former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden in Ukraine.</p>
      <p>In October, US federal prosecutors unsealed an indictment against Fruman and three other businessman - Lev Parnas, David Correia and Andrey Kukushkin - for funnelling $1 million in donations from foreign nationals to unspecified political campaigns in the United States.</p>
      <p>The four men are also accused of having donated money to a member of Congress and then pressing the lawmaker to remove or recall the then-US ambassador to Ukraine.</p>
      <p>The US Attorney's Office spokesperson pointed out that Fruman’s defence team asked that the bail amount be reduced, but the government opposed the request.</p>
