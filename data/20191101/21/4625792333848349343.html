      <p>Despite several <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/beto-orourke-returns-to-the-trail-with-a-mission-to-take-on-trump-and-reject-cliche-campaigning">campaign resets</a> and an impressive fundraising haul of $6.1 million in the first 24 hours following announcing his White House run, the former Texas congressman failed to capture the excitement that surrounded his 2018 Senate race.</p>
      <p>While that <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/ted-cruz-defeats-beto-orourke-wins-re-election-battle">effort to unseat Republican Sen. Ted Cruz failed</a>, O'Rourke, 46, became a media darling and set the record for receiving the most votes by a Democrat in state history.</p>
      <p>O'Rourke's narrow loss to Cruz set the tone for his presidential campaign, where he argued that he could compete in states traditionally held by Republicans. Yet O'Rourke failed to gain significant momentum and consistently polled with 1%-2% in primary polls.</p>
      <p>During his presidential campaign, O'Rourke ruled out another Senate run. From 2013 to 2019, O'Rourke served as a congressman for Texas's 16th Congressional District.</p>
