      <h2>The superstar's sister separated from her partner Alan Ferguson in secret earlier this year</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T21:33:09+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 21:33</time> by <a rel="author">Louise Randell, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/louise-randell/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/beyonce">Beyonce</a> 's sister Solange Knowles has split from her from husband Alan Ferguson after five years of marriage.</p>
      <p>The singer, 33, has been with Alan for more than 11 years and they have been married since 2014.</p>
      <p>However, the union broke down earlier this year and they separated in secret - with Solange only now confirming the split.</p>
      <p>In a reflective post on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> , she explained: "I've lived my best and worst moments in front of the lens and gaze of the world since I was a teenager.</p>
      <p>"I've always tried to live in my truth no matter how ugly or full of love it is.</p>
      <p>"I've also tried to carve out the space to protect my heart, and my life as it unfolds, evolves, and changes.</p>

      <p>"11 years ago I met a phenomenal man who changed every existence of my life.</p>
      <p>"Early this year we separated and parted ways."</p>
      <p>She went on to insist she will not reveal the reason for the split, declaring: "It ain’t nan no body business."</p>
      <p>Solange added: "I find it necessary to protect the sacredness of my personal truth and to live in it fully just as I have before and will continue to do.</p>

      <p>"It is unfair to not have power of your own story as you shape and mold and rewrite it yourself.</p>
      <p>'I'm leaning into the fear of the unknown and all the glory and power I know exist within god and the universes grace.</p>
      <p>"May all of your transitions no matter how big or small, be kind to you and filled with incredible love and light!"</p>
      <p>Solange married Alan in New Orleans in November 2014 and their lavish wedding was attended by her superstar sister and brother-in-law <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jay-z">Jay-Z</a> .</p>
      <p>She has a 15-year-old son, Daniel Julez, with her first husband, Daniel Smith. </p>
