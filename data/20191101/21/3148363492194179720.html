      <h1>No Labor Shortage: 11.5M Unemployed Americans Want Full-Time Jobs</h1>
      <h2>Despite claims by the big business lobby and corporate interests that there are labor shortages in blue-collar and white-collar workforces, the latest federal data reveal that about 11.5 million unemployed and underemployed Americans want full-time jobs.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T21:36:16+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 21:36</time> by <a rel="author">John Binder</a></address>
      <p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf">revealed</a> in its latest employment report for October that while Americans enjoy continued <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2019/11/01/america-added-128000-jobs-in-october-unemployment-at-3-6/">50-year-low unemployment</a> thanks to President Trump’s “Buy American, Hire American” economy, there is still no labor shortage for employers.</p>
      <p>Overall, there are about 5.9 million unemployed Americans — including 726,000 American teenagers, 319,000 black Americans, and 242,000 Hispanics, all of whom want full-time jobs. Of those unemployed, about 1.3 million Americans have been jobless for at least 27 weeks.</p>
      <p>Likewise, about 4.4 million Americans are working part-time jobs but want full-time employment. Another 1.2 million Americans are not in the labor force at all, though they want full-time jobs as well and had searched for jobs within the last year.</p>
      <p>Of those Americans not in the labor force, 341,000 told the Labor Department that they were discouraged by their job prospects and believe there are no jobs for them.</p>

      <p>While Americans have enjoyed <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/10/16/low-income-american-workers-enjoy-highest-wage-growth/">significant wage growth</a> in Trump’s economy, especially blue-collar and working-class Americans, corporate interests have increasingly suggested that the U.S. must continue importing millions of foreign workers every year to fill jobs.</p>
      <p>In April, former Chamber of Commerce President Tom <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/04/26/chamber-of-commerce-demands-more-immigration-u-s-is-out-of-people/">Donahue said</a> the U.S. needed more legal immigration because the country is “out of people.”</p>
      <p>Extensive research by economists like George Borjas and analyst Steven Camarota has found that the country’s current legal immigration system — wherein 1.2 million mostly low-skilled workers are admitted annually — burdens U.S. taxpayers and America’s working and middle class while redistributing about <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2016/09/21/national-academies-study-shows-500-billion-immigration-tax-on-working-americans/">$500 billion</a> in wealth every year to major employers and newly arrived immigrants.</p>
      <p>Camarota, director of research for the Center for Immigration Studies, has found that every one-percent increase in the immigrant composition of American workers’ occupations reduces their weekly wages by about 0.5 percent. This means the average native-born American worker today has his weekly wages reduced by perhaps 8.5 percent because of current legal immigration levels.</p>
