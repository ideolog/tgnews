      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T21:21:25+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 21:21</time> by <a rel="author">Petrana Radulovic</a></address>
      <p>The sequel to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/11/28/18105326/spider-man-into-the-spider-verse-review"><i>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</i></a> will swing into theaters on April 8, 2022.</p>
      <p>The date was <a href="https://twitter.com/SpiderVerse/status/1190373194374377472">revealed on Twitter</a>, with a very brief teaser that showed Miles’ graffitied Spider-Man logo interdimensionally glitching, with the year 2022 flashing in the middle of it.</p>
      <p>A follow-up to the Academy Award-winning animated film was announced in November 2018, even before the film’s premiere, along with a spinoff focusing on <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/8/21/20812855/sony-spider-man-movies-venom-2-spider-verse-2-marvel-characters-upcoming-movies">Spider-Gwen and other female Spider-characters such as Silk and Spider-Woman.</a> It’s not confirmed <i>which</i> of those sequels/spinoffs this one is. The logo at the center is Miles’ emblem, and the <a href="https://www.marvel.com/articles/movies/spiderman-into-the-spiderverse-sequel">Marvel announcement specifically said “sequel,”</a> so we’re gonna guess that this is the directly Miles-focused movie.</p>
      <p>The end of <i>Into the Spider-Verse</i> saw all the Spider-people — Peter B. Parker, Gwen Stacy, Spider-Ham, Spider Noir, and Peni Parker — back in their respective dimensions. But right before the credits ran, a flash of Gwen’s dimension color scheme opened up and greeted Miles, indicating some sort of cross-dimensional travel. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/12/13/18136487/spider-man-spider-verse-end-credits-scene-explained-2099-pointing-meme">The post-credits scene also had Spider-Man 2099 (Oscar Isaac) using a dimension jumping device</a>. Will the crew come back?</p>
      <p>The upcoming sequel comes from director Joaquim Dos Santos (<i>Voltron: Legendary Defenders</i>), with David Callaham (<i>Wonder Woman 1984</i>, <i>Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings</i>) writing. There is no further production news.</p>
