      <p>he new <a href="http://bit.ly/34hZdQo">Infinity Cable</a> is a 6.5ft nylon cable with interchangeable magnetic connectors for USB-C, Lightning and micro-USB. Not only does that mean you can use a single cable with all of your devices, it also brings back Apple’s MagSafe-like functionality that allows the cable to safely disconnect if someone trips or something gets snagged on it.</p>
      <p>While there are other magnetic cables on the market that are cross device compatible, this is the first with full support for 100W Power Delivery and Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 and 4.0, meaning you’ll be able to charge your MacBooks, iPad Pro and any other device at full speed. It also has full data transfer capabilities in addition to charging, which is not something all the other magnetic cables can claim.</p>
      <p>You can <a href="http://bit.ly/34hZdQo">grab your Infinity Cable now for up to 60% off</a> its expected retail price with early bird pricing on Kickstarter now starting at just $25 per cable set.</p>
