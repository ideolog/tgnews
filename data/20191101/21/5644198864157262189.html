      <p>UBS Group could double the profit it makes from its American wealth management arm within a decade even as it cuts staff numbers by targeting the super-rich, the co-head of the business told Reuters.</p>
      <p>ZURICH: UBS Group could double the profit it makes from its American wealth management arm within a decade even as it cuts staff numbers by targeting the super-rich, the co-head of the business told Reuters.</p>
      <p>By encouraging customers to use more lucrative services, such as loans and mandates, where the wealth manager takes more control of a client's investments, UBS could make do with significantly fewer U.S. customer advisers than the 6,600 it now employs, its co-head of wealth management, Tom Naratil, said in an interview.</p>

      <p>"Even if our total adviser count in the U.S. drops below 6,000, it would be a group of advisers who are twice as productive as they are today, measured in revenue per adviser," he said.</p>
      <p>"If we get that kind of profile, then in 5 to 10 years from now we'll have a business that could probably makes twice as much as we do today."</p>
      <p>Naratil heads the business alongside former Credit Suisse star manager Iqbal Khan, who joined UBS last month. While at Credit Suisse, Khan managed to double his division’s pre-tax income in just three years.</p>
      <p>Both are considered candidates to succeed Chief Executive Sergio Ermotti in the years ahead.</p>
      <p>In the U.S. market, UBS defines the high net worth segment as starting at roughly US$1 million in investable assets. Over time, that threshold may rise to US$5 million, so clients with US$5-100 million would be served by its core adviser group.</p>
      <p>It is shifting to a model in which those with more than US$100 million to invest would be served primarily in partnership with UBS's family office consultants.</p>
      <p>Last year UBS made a pretax profit of just over US$1.5 billion in wealth management in North and South America, significantly more than in any other region. It was US$6.4 billion across the group.    The bank announced its focus on the American market at an investor conference a year ago. Outside the United States, UBS is already heavily involved in the super-rich business.</p>
      <p>In the highly competitive U.S. market, the focus has been on wealthy individuals with assets of up to US$100 million. Now UBS explicitly wants to address super-rich people with even more money.    New advisers which UBS is wooing from rivals such as JP Morgan or Goldman Sachs should also help with this growth.</p>
      <p>But UBS is being selective, Naratil said. The number of U.S. advisers has shrunk in recent years.</p>
      <p>In the first three quarters of 2019 UBS recorded outflows of US$8 billion in the Americas region, but much of this is linked to less-wealthy customers with whom UBS also earns less, according to people close to the matter.</p>
