      <p>Two people have been arrested after the death of a man who turned up to hospital suffering from a stab wound.</p>
      <p>James Amadu, 26, arrived injured at a north London hospital after police were called to reports of a stabbing at 1.02pm yesterday - he sadly died at 2.21pm.</p>
      <p>Today detectives have confirmed an 18-year-old man and a 15-year-old boy have been arrested on suspicion of murder.</p>
      <p>Both will be questioned by Specialist Crime detectives at north London police stations over the incident in Enfield, north London.</p>
      <p>Emergency services turned up to the scene on Thursday after they were alerted to the incident and a crime scene was established - but no victim was present.</p>
      <p>James - understood to have celebrated his birthday just last week - tragically died in hospital a short while later.</p>
      <p>The victim was said to be a 'doting' father to his two-year-old daughter and has been described as the backbone of his family.</p>
      <p>James' dad Francis told the <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/enfield-murder-doting-father-james-amadu-stabbed-to-death-in-flats-stairwell-praised-as-backbone-of-a4276226.html">Evening Standard</a>: "More needs to be done to tackle knife crime and young people need to lay down their blades."</p>
      <p>His mum Josephine spoke of her heartbreak and devastation, saying she couldn't have wanted a better son.</p>
      <p>James' brother Franklin, 23, added: "James was the backbone of the family - he was my backbone, he put me on the right path, he made me what I am."</p>

      <p>Franklin said they'd just launched a clothing business together and described James as a talented, funny and great businessman.</p>
      <p>Sister Messie spoke of the love James had for his daughter, and said the family plans to bring her up as the 'princess she has always been'.</p>
      <p>A statement by the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/metropolitan-police">Met Police</a> released this evening says: "A post-mortem examination concluded at Haringey mortuary on Friday, 1 November and gave the cause of death as a stab wound.</p>
      <p>"The victim’s next of kin have been informed.</p>
      <p>"Officers from North Area Command Unit investigate. Detectives from Specialist Crime are leading the investigation.</p>
      <p>"Road closures are in place in Lavender Hill near the crime scene. Motorists are advised to avoid the area."</p>
      <p>Kim Blackman, 34, said the incident happened outside her house.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the Mirror Online yesterday, she said: "It's an absolute tragedy.</p>
      <p>"For a young lad to be stabbed in such a quiet area proves we are not safe anywhere. I’m devastated for the young boy and his family.</p>
      <p>"This has got to stop.</p>
      <p>"I go home at lunch and to think I was so busy at work that I did not make it there today frightens me."</p>
