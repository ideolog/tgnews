      <p>A man who wore body armor and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/missouri-walmart-suspect-says-timing-bad-doesnt-regret">carried a loaded weapon into a Walmart</a> in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/midwest/missouri">Missouri</a> over the summer to test the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/personal-freedoms/second-amendment">Second Amendment</a> pleaded guilty Friday to making a false report.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/suspect-in-disturbance-at-missouri-walmart-said-he-was-testing-2nd-amendment-rights-prosecutors">Dmitriy Andreychenko</a>, 21, pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor charge after originally being charged with making a terrorist threat.</p>
      <p>Under an agreement with prosecutors, he received a 180-day suspended sentence and two years' probation. He also must receive firearm training, Greene County Prosecuting Attorney Dan Patterson said in a <a href="https://greenecountymo.gov/files/PDF/file.pdf?id=34813">news release</a>. The terrorist threat charge carried a sentence of up to four years in prison.</p>

      <p>The Springfield resident caused panic inside the big-box store on Aug. 8 when he filmed himself entering while armored and armed. A store manager pulled a fire alarm, causing shoppers to flee.</p>
      <p>The incident came days after a gunman killed 22 people inside a Walmart in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/el-paso-walmart-shooting-massacre-suspect-faces-judge">El Paso, Texas</a>, and another killed nine people hours later in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/dayton-gunman-shot-26-people-32-seconds-police">Dayton, Ohio</a>.</p>
      <p>"I wanted to know if Walmart honored the Second Amendment," Andreychenko said, according to a probable cause statement.</p>
      <p>Patterson said Andreychenko was conducting a "social experiment" and didn't intend to shoot anyone.</p>
      <p>He said Andreychenko researched both shootings. The day before, he posted a photograph to Snapchat of a family member wearing his body armor looking down the sights of a rifle with the caption, "Watch out Walmart," Patterson said.</p>

      <p>Andreychenko told local media outlets his actions were "foolish" but that he didn't regret it. His attorney, Dee Wampler, admitted his client's actions were ill-timed.</p>
