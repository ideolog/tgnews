      <p>After <a href="http://www.superherohype.com/tag/spider-man-into-the-spider-verse"><b>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</b></a> became a massive success in 2018, a sequel was inevitable. Now, the follow up to the Oscar winner for Best Animated Motion Picture has a date. Sony’s official <b>Spider-Verse</b> twitter account posted a teaser of Miles Morales’ Spider emblem with an inter-dimensional glitch. It also shared the release date for the sequel: April 8, 2022.</p>

      <p>Joaquim Dos Santos (<b>Voltron: Legendary Defenders</b>) will direct the upcoming sequel. He will also be joined by screenwriter David Callaham, whose previous credits include <b>Wonder Woman 1984</b> and <b>Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings</b>. Phil Lord and Christopher Miller produced the first <b>Into the Spider-Verse</b>. Bob Persichetti, Peter Ramsey, and Rodney Rothman co-directed the original, while Lord wrote the screenplay.</p>

      <p>Presumably the sequel will retain most of the voice cast from the first movie. Shameik Moore portrayed Miles Morales, while  Jake Johnson voiced Peter B. Parker, and Hailee Steinfeld appeared as Spider-Gwen. John Mulaney also co-starred as Spider-Ham, alongside Kimiko Glenn as Peni Parker, Nicolas Cage as Spider-Man Noir, Brian Tyree Henry as Jefferson Davis, Luna Lauren Velez as Rio Morales. Additionally, the post-credits scene introduced Oscar Isaac’s Miguel O’Hara, the Spider-Man of 2099.</p>
