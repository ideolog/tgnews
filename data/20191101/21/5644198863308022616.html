      <p>REUTERS: Alphabet Inc-owned Google will buy wearable device maker Fitbit Inc for US$2.1 billion, as the search giant looks to enter the fast-growing market for fitness trackers and smartwatches.</p>
      <p>Fitbit said on Friday it had been offered US$7.35 per share in cash, a premium of about 19per cent to the stock's closing price on Thursday.</p>

      <p>Fitbit shares have gained more than 40per cent since Reuters exclusively reported on Monday that Google had made an offer for the maker of the popular colorful fitness trackers.</p>
      <p>While Google has joined other major technology companies such as Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd in developing smart phones, it has yet to develop any wearable offerings.</p>
      <p>Qatalyst Partners LLP acted as financial adviser to Fitbit, while Fenwick &amp; West LLP was its legal adviser.</p>
