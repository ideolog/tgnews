      <p>Being the CEO of Microsoft has certain perks, including getting to try out the company’s recently announced dual-screen laptops and phone.</p>
      <p>Satya Nadella said he wanted to carry around his Surface Duo and Neo everywhere, and shared some of his impressions of <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2019/interview-satya-nadella-microsofts-new-world-view-dual-screen-devices-pentagon-cloud-deal/">Geekwire</a>, praising the device’s versatility and user interface.</p>
      <p>He praised the device’s Pen-first “Moleskine-like” experience, saying it was an improvement on touch-first devices as it offered a real replacement for paper.</p>
      <blockquote>One of the things I like to do is I like to annotate, I like to write, here I’m able to read and communicate, even on a Teams meeting. That’s a game-changer for me. I want to do a lot of Teams meetings even on my phone. [With dual-screen devices] I can actually have the conversation happening in full video on one screen and on another screen, I can take notes on OneNote. And that combination is super productive.</blockquote>
      <p>The idea of a pen-first operating system is of course very similar to the Courier concept, but what little we have seen of Windows 10 X suggests that it is still large designed for keyboard, mouse and touch.</p>

      <p>The promotional video, for example, is notable for showing mostly touch-based interactions and only the use of the pen for annotation.</p>
      <p>Contrast this with the concept videos for the Courier where the person was actually constantly holding the stylus in their hand.</p>

      <p>Do our readers think Windows 10 X or even Microsoft’s version of Android can deliver on a pen-first promise? Let us know below.</p>
