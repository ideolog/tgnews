        <b>WASHINGTON (Sputnik) - The United States is trying to learn more about the new leader of Daesh*, including his background and previous role in the terrorist organisation, US Counterterrorism Coordinator Amb. Nathan Sales told reporters on Friday.</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>"We are looking into the leader, his role in the organization, where he came from," Sales said. "I don't have anything to announce on that obviously publicly. But anytime there is a leadership transition in a terrorist organization, we want to make sure that we have the latest information that we need to have to confront the threat.”</blockquote>
      <p>Earlier on Friday, President Donald <a href="https://sputniknews.com/world/201911011077200869-trump-claims-to-know-identity-of-new-daesh-leader/">Trump said</a> that he knows the identity of the Daesh* new leader after the death of the terror group's head Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in a US military raid. Trump provided no details about the identity of the new leader.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, Daesh* gave the new leader’s name as Abu Ibrahim al-Hashemi al-Qurayshi, a nom de guerre that appears to depict him as a member of the Quraysh tribe and descendant of the Islamic prophet Mohammed.</p>
      <p>Baghdadi <a href="https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/201910311077191359-daesh-confirms-death-of-al-baghdadi-following-us-raid-names-successor/">blew himself up</a> along with two children on Saturday when he was cornered by the US military in his hideout in northern Syria, according to US officials.</p>
      <p>Baghdadi’s immediate likely successor, Abu Hassan al-Muhajir, was killed in a US airstrike a day later, according to US officials.</p>
