      <h1>All the Twin Peaks You Could Ever Want is in This Gorgeous New Box Set</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T21:30:48+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 21:30</time> by <a rel="author">Cheryl Eddy</a></address>
      <p>There’s always <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-twin-peaks-finale-was-as-gloriously-enigmatic-as-it-1799116644"><i>Twin Peaks</i></a> in the air, whether it’s rumours of a fourth season or the sight of <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/watch-david-lynch-direct-one-of-twin-peaks-scariest-mom-1820846565?_ga=2.172926752.208692874.1572300450-1751557175.1567029747">David Lynch</a> picking up an honorary <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGTaJFbLoqI">Oscar</a>. The next entry in the cherry pie sweepstakes is <i>Twin Peaks: From Z to A</i>, a giant Blu-ray set celebrating <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2018/09/these-montages-capture-the-disturbed-beautiful-soul-of-twin-peaks/">the cult series</a> that comes out early next year.</p>
      <p>Fans of any pop culture property know there’s nothing more annoying than buying the “complete” version of something, only to discover that a new, more complete version of the thing is about to hit stores. <i>Twin Peaks </i>fans have been through this a few times. But unless Lynch decides he wants to reconnect with Agent Cooper and company a fourth time, <i>Twin Peaks: From Z to A</i> sure feels like the last <i>Twin Peaks</i> box set you will ever need to buy.</p>
      <p>You can behold the unfurled majesty of <i>Twin Peaks: From Z to A</i>’s 21-disc Blu-ray set at the top of this post – yes, that <i>is</i> a nifty little acrylic die-cut of Coop and Laura in the Red Room – but the real allure is what’s inside. Here’s what you get (deep breath): both seasons of the iconic original series, plus the US <i>and</i> international versions of the pilot; the 18-part 2017 <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-22-most-shocking-moments-of-twin-peaks-the-return-1802239982?_ga=2.150922421.208692874.1572300450-1751557175.1567029747">Showtime revival</a>, also known as <i>Twin Peaks: A Limited Event Series</i>; and <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/twin-peaks-fire-walk-with-me-is-even-weirder-than-you-1753295205">1992 feature film <i>Fire Walk With Me</i></a> with its deleted scenes.</p>
      <p>And that’s not all! You also get never-before-seen, behind-the-scenes footage of Lynch working on each episode of <i>A Limited Event Series</i>; a new featurette with Harry “Deputy Andy” Goaz and Kimmy “Lucy Moran” Robertson chatting about their<i> Twin Peaks</i> memories; the interview with MacLachlan and Lee mentioned above; and full versions of several Roadhouse musical performances, as seen on <i>A Limited Event </i>series.</p>
      <p>The included performances are: Chromatics, “Shadow;” the Cactus Blossoms, “Mississippi;” Au Revoir Simone, “Lark,” “A Violent Yet Flammable World,” and a previously released performance of “Sad Song;” Trouble, “Snake Eyes;” Sharon Van Etten, “Tarifa;” <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/10/watchmens-incredible-soundtrack-is-coming-first-to-vinyl-because-of-course-it-is/">Nine Inch Nails</a>, “She’s Gone Away;” Hudson Mohawke, “Human;” Rebekah Del Rio, “No Stars;” Chromatics, “Saturday;” James Marshall (as James Hurley, <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2017/08/twin-peaks-actor-takes-on-the-immortal-question-is-james-hurley-cool/">who has always been cool</a>), “Just You;” Lissie, “Wild West;” The Veils, “Axolotl;” Eddie Vedder, “Out Of Sand;” and Julee Cruise, “The World Spins.”</p>

      <p>The set also repurposes an array of special features retained from previous <i>Twin Peaks</i> box sets <i>The Entire Mystery</i> (including the deleted and extended scenes, packaged as <i>The Missing Pieces) </i>and<i> A Limited Event Series</i>. You’ll also get a 4K UHD disc containing both 1990<i> Twin Peaks </i>pilots and <i>A Limited Event</i>’s jaw-dropping eighth episode. Got a light?</p>
      <p>For those with a slightly more casual interest in <i>Twin Peaks</i>, but who are still gripped with the obsessive need to own all three seasons (<i>Twin Peaks </i>will do that to you), there’s a slightly less hefty option: the first complete release of <i>Twin Peaks: The Television Collection </i>on Blu-ray and DVD.<i> </i>The blue rose on the box art is a nice touch.</p>
