      <p>Sony Pictures’ highly anticipated sequel to 2018’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/17/17609436/into-the-spider-verse-directors-interview-style-animation-filmmaking-behind-the-scenes"><i>Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse</i></a><i> </i>will arrive on April 8th, 2022.</p>

      <p>There’s never been a more important time for Miles Morales and the Spider-Man future at Sony Pictures. Morales and the Spider-Verse represent a future for the character within the larger Sony Spider-Man universe. Sony and Disney are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/27/20887093/spider-man-marvel-cinematic-universe-sony-disney-tom-holland-kevin-feige">working on a third Peter Parker-starring Spider-Man movie</a> — one that stars Tom Holland and features Spider-Man within the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Having a beloved animated franchise surrounding Morales is key to preparing for a world that Holland’s Peter Parker may not exist in following the next film. Sony hasn’t specified if voice actor Shameik Moore will return to the role.</p>
      <p><i>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse </i>is largely regarded as one of the best Spider-Man movies of all time, and a visionary take on the superhero genre. It was also awarded the Oscar for Best Animated Picture earlier this year. We <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/28/18115201/spider-man-into-the-verse-movie-review-miles-morales">said in our review</a>:</p>
      <blockquote><i>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</i> is a raucous, smart, self-referential adventure. The comics-inspired visuals are stunning, and the emotional coming-of-age story is relevant and inspiring, even as it acknowledges the many <i>Spider-Man</i> movies that have come before it. Sony is clearly looking for a way to launch its own distinct take on Spider-Man that can stand up to the live-action MCU version, and that franchise now has its first installment.</blockquote>
      <p>Executive producer Amy Pascal also hasn’t shied away from Sony’s commitment to the Spider-Verse, <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/spider-man-into-the-spider-verse-definitely-getting-a-sequel/">telling <i>io9</i> earlier this year</a>, “We are definitely hard at work on the sequel. You can expect another movie.”</p>
