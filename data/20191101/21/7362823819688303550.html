      <p>The toe bone of a 39,000-year-old eagle suggests that Neanderthals made pendants and ornaments from the birds' talons.</p>
      <p>Excavations in Foradada Cave, not far from northeastern Spain's Mediterranean coast, produced the ancient imperial eagle toe fossil, according to a study <a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/11/eaax1984">published</a> on Friday.</p>

      <p>Stone tool marks on the bone were likely made when someone removed a talon from the bird's foot, according to archaeologist Antonio Rodriguez-Hidalgo of Madrid's Institute of Human Evolution in Africa and his colleagues.</p>
      <p>As <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-toe-bone-hints-neandertals-used-eagle-talons-jewelry">Science News</a> reports, no signs of burned sediment or cooking areas turned up, which suggests that the birds were captured for their talons and not as food.</p>

      <p>The researchers discovered a total of 12 bones from imperial eagles and other birds of prey, which included seven toe bones and one talon.</p>
      <p>The study was published in <a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/11/eaax1984">Science Advances</a>.</p>
