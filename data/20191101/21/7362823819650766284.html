      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/kim-kardashian-wins-missguided-lawsuit">Kim Kardashian</a> and her family had a hard time during this year's Halloween photo shoot.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/kardashians">Kardashian</a>, who was dressed as Betty Rubble, posted a Flintstones-themed family photo on Instagram, revealing that her daughter Chicago had to be edited in.</p>
      <p>"This family pic was such a challenge because Chicago was so scared of Dino!" Kardashian, 39, said of her 21-month-old daughter in the caption. Dino is the Flintstone family's dinosaur pet.</p>

      <p>Kardashian explained that it was her husband, Kanye West, who was behind the Dino disguise.</p>
      <p>"LOL we tried to explain and show her that it was just daddy but she didn't get the concept yet!" Kardashian said. "So shoutout to the photographer for editing her in &amp; making our family Flintstones dreams come true."</p>
