      <h1>Financial Blacklisting: PayPal Bans Conservative Street Artist Sabo | Breitbart</h1>
      <h2>Conservative street artist Sabo has been banned from PayPal, which will withhold funds from him for six months, according to a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sabo.unsavoryagent/posts/10221957449064973">post</a> on the artist’s Facebook page. The artist claimed in an email to Breitbart News that Etsy has also blacklisted his online store from its platform.</h2>

      <p>“PayPal canceled my account with all of my money in it,” wrote Sabo. “They are holding my funds for the next 6 months.”</p>
      <p>“I explained to them that I live in a city with 60,000 homeless people, and that they are about to make me and my wide join their ranks,” wrote the L.A-based artist. “They apologized. F*** them!”</p>
      <p>“We’ll find an alternative way to generate income and I’m sure they will work to hit that as well. And then we’ll find another.”</p>
      <p>“2020 is right around the corner and they are doing everything they can to silence our side.”</p>
      <p>Sabo’s ban from PayPal appears to be another case of financial blacklisting, in which the left target the capacity of conservative activists, journalists, and organizations to earn a living. Echoing previously blacklistings, Sabo also seems to be experiencing some measure of coordinated efforts, as he claims Etsy also shut down his online store.</p>
      <p>Over the past two years, the number of conservatives and right-wingers who have been banned from online funding platforms and even bank and credit card services has grown.</p>
      <p>PayPal alone has banned <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2019/02/06/paypal-blacklists-jewish-conservative-activist-laura-loomer/">Laura Loomer</a>, <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2018/09/21/paypal-blacklists-infowars-for-promoting-hate/">InfoWars</a>, and the <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2018/11/14/paypal-blacklists-free-speech-youtube-alternative-bitchute/">free-speech focused YouTube alternative BitChute</a> among others. <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2019/02/25/paypal-ceo-admits-partnership-with-far-left-splc-to-blacklist-conservatives/">In an interview with the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> earlier this year</a>, the CEO of the online payment processing company has admitted that his company works with the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLIC), a far-left outfit notorious for making false charges of racism against critics of progressivism.</p>
      <p>The digital rights group Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) has <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2018/07/24/electronic-frontier-foundation-banks-payment-processors-are-becoming-de-facto-internet-censors/">spoken out</a> against the rise of financial blacklisting. In a comment to Breitbart News last year, a spokeswoman for the organization said banks and payment processors were becoming “de facto internet censors.”</p>
      <p>“In my opinion, financial institutions don’t have the expertise to judge whether speech has societal value or violates the First Amendment,” said the spokeswoman. “They shouldn’t be making those decisions at all.”</p>
      <p>Sabo has created a wide range of popular street art with a conservative bent. He <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2019/05/11/sabo-lampoons-pete-buttigieg-with-mad-magazine-cartoon-alfred-e-neuman/">lampooned</a> Mayor Pete as Alfred E. Neuman and has <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2018/08/20/sabo-responds-to-asia-argento/">taken aim</a> at Asia Argento of the #MeToo movement. Silicon Valley has also been a prime target for Sabo, including a recent campaign <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2018/05/04/conservative-street-artist-sabo-mocks-google-ceo-sundar-pichais-380-million-payday/">pointing out</a> Google CEO Sundar Pichai’s $380 million pay package.</p>
