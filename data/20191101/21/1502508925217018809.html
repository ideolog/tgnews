      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/apple">Apple </a>Inc. is seeking exclusions from President Donald Trump’s tariffs that went into effect Sept. 1 on the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/apple">Apple </a>Watch, iMac, parts for the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/iphone">iPhone </a>and other components imported from China.</p>
      <p>The company filed requests for exclusions from 15% duties on 11 products or components Thursday, the first day U.S. firms could seek relief from the tariffs on about $110 billion in Chinese imports. The <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/iphone">iPhone </a>maker had mixed results on its requests for exclusions from the previous round of duties.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/apple">Apple </a>also is seeking to avoid tariffs on the HomePod, the Beats Pill+ wireless speaker, <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/airpods">AirPods </a>and Beats wireless earbuds, <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/iphone">iPhone </a>smart battery case, the charging case for <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/airpods">AirPods </a>and the PowerBeats, storage components for the Mac Pro, and batteries for the iPhone and MacBook, according to the request posted online.</p>
      <p>Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said earlier this week that Apple is already paying tariffs on some products.</p>
      <p>Exclusion decisions are based on whether a product is available only from China, is strategically important or related to Chinese industrial programs, and whether duties will “cause severe economic harm” to the company or U.S. interests.</p>
      <p>In its requests for tariff waivers, the Cupertino, California-based company said it hasn’t identified a source outside of China that is able to meet U.S. demand for the products or components in the coming year. An Apple spokesman declined to comment Friday.</p>
      <p>Apple made similar requests for relief from 25% duties on $200 billion in goods imposed last year. While the U.S. Trade Representative’s office denied exclusions on five Chinese-made components for the upcoming Mac Pro computer, it approved tariff waivers on 10 parts for the product.</p>
      <p>The company announced in September it would make new Mac Pro computers at a plant in Austin, Texas -- which it has operated since 2013 -- after originally considering shifting production to China like its other products.</p>
