      <p>WASHINGTON: Google agreed Friday to buy Fitbit for US$2.1 billion in a move giving the US tech giant a fresh entry in the wearable technology space and helping it ramp up its challenge to Apple.</p>
      <p>The deal for one of the top makers of fitness trackers comes with the internet search leader seeking to expand further into hardware.</p>

      <p>"We have built a trusted brand that supports more than 28 million active users around the globe who rely on our products to live a healthier, more active life," Fitbit co-founder and chief executive James Park said in a statement by the two firms announcing the deal.</p>
      <p>"Google is an ideal partner to advance our mission."</p>
      <p>Rick Osterloh, Google senior vice president for devices and services, said the deal means "bringing together the best hardware, software and AI" to bring more wearables to the marketplace.</p>
      <p>"Google aspires to create tools that help people enhance their knowledge, success, health and happiness. This goal is closely aligned with Fitbit's long-time focus on wellness and helping people live healthier, more active lives," Osterloh said in a blog post.</p>
      <p>The companies said the Fitbit platform would remain "platform-agnostic" and continue to serve Apple's iOS devices as well as those powered by the Google Android system.</p>
      <p>The tie-up may also enable Google to expand into digital health, following Apple in partnerships with researchers and medical facilities which use wearables to collect data.</p>
      <p>"Google sees important opportunities in digital health moving forward, but they needed a stronger set of devices to fit into the digital health environment," said Bob O'Donnell, chief analyst at Technalysis Research.</p>

        <b>FITBIT LOSING STEAM</b>
      </p>
      <p>While Fitbit helped popularise fitness bands and trackers, it has lost ground in recent years to rivals in the wearables market as Apple shook up the market with its top-selling smartwatch.</p>
      <p>A survey by research firm IDC for the second quarter of 2019 found Fitbit in fourth place in a market led by China's Xiaomi, followed by Apple and Chinese-based Huawei.</p>
      <p>Fitbit introduced its own smartwatch in 2017 but it has failed to keep pace with the Apple Watch, introduced in 2015.</p>
      <p>Google, which faces pressure from regulators around the world over its dominance of internet search, has been boosting its hardware offerings, including a line of Pixel smartphones and tablets, along with connected speakers.</p>
      <p>The Alphabet unit is largely absent from wearables gadgetry, following its failed Google Glass project, but produces the WearOS software used by makers of these devices.</p>
      <p>
        <b>HARVESTING DATA?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The companies said they would take steps to protect user data after the tie-up, and that Fitbit-generated data would not be used for ad targeting by Google.</p>
      <p>"Fitbit will continue to put users in control of their data and will remain transparent about the data it collects and why," the company said.</p>
      <p>"The company never sells personal information, and Fitbit health and wellness data will not be used for Google ads."</p>
      <p>Still, analysts pointed out that Google may benefit from the large Fitbit database for health apps and artificial intelligence.</p>
      <p>"Google is acquiring customers and data," said Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights &amp; Strategy. "I think it's a good move given Google has failed so far in wearables and Apple is so far ahead with Watch."</p>
      <p>Avi Greengart of the consultancy Techsponential said Google will benefit from the large amounts of data generated from devices as it refines its artificial intelligence tools.</p>
      <p>"One way to use data is to sell advertising, another is to better understand human behavior," Greengart said.</p>
      <p>Greengart said he sees the main driver of the deal to be Fitbit's strong brand, which can help jump-start a push into wearables.</p>
      <p>Stephen Mears of Futuresource Consulting agreed, saying both firms will benefit from the tie-up.</p>
      <p>"Fitbit's strong brand presence and expansive portfolio that straddles high-end fitness trackers and entry-level smartwatches, as well as its growing health subscription services, will give Google a large enough footprint from which it can relaunch itself into the wearables competition," Mears said in a research note.</p>
      <p>"Moreover, with Google's mixed success in its go-to-market strategies for other hardware, the company has also acquired Fitbit's expertise in developing strong consumer demand."</p>
