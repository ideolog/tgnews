      <p>The status of Saskatchewan Roughriders quarterback Cody Fajardo remains in question as the team prepares for Saturday’s home date with the Edmonton Eskimos.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/no-fajardo-at-roughriders-practice-thursday">Fajardo pulled an oblique muscle during practice on Wednesday and the recovery has not been significant.</a>
      </p>
      <p>“If the game were today, I would not be able to play,” Fajardo told reporters on Friday.</p>
      <p>Earlier in the day, Fajardo was listed first on the team’s depth chart, but that was strictly procedural.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/quarterback-cody-fajardo-named-saskatchewan-roughriders-most-outstanding-player">Fajardo was hurt the same day he was named the team’s most outstanding player.</a>
      </p>
      <p>“I was throwing 20 to 30 balls before (the injury),” he said. “I didn’t really feel anything in the oblique — nothing, really. I threw a deep ball to my left to Manny (Arceaneaux) and found myself on my knees on the ground.</p>
      <p>“I felt like I got stabbed. It was, ‘What just happened there?’ ”</p>
      <p>An injury in practice was a surprise, considering the hits Fajardo has survived during games this season.</p>
      <p>“It has been a tough injury,” he said. “It’s one of those fluky things that you don’t really plan for. I’ve taken 1,000 hits over the course of the year, and throwing routes on air is the thing that brings me to my knees.”</p>

      <p>Fajardo may yet take a stab at playing Saturday in a regular-season game of elevated importance. A victory would give Saskatchewan first place in the CFL’s West Division for the first time since 2009, and for only the second time in a span of 43 seasons.</p>
      <p>Based on what was said on Friday, it sounded like rookie Isaac Harker was the likeliest candidate to start at quarterback for Saskatchewan versus Edmonton.</p>
      <p>When asked about Fajardo’s status, head coach Craig Dickenson said: “I’m not overly optimistic, but I’m going to wait until tomorrow.”</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/day-1-of-rookie-camp-was-surreal-for-the-saskatchewan-roughriders-isaac-harker">Harker has appeared in three games this season, completing 21 of 33 passes for 254 yards with no touchdowns and three picks.</a>
      </p>
      <p>Fajardo expressed the utmost confidence in Harker and third-stringer Bryan Bennett, both of whom could see playing time Saturday.</p>
      <p>“It’s such a big game, where if I’m close to 50, 60 per cent, I’m out there on that field with my guys,” Fajardo said. “I also don’t want to be selfish and go out there and do stuff that I can’t do and put the team in a bad situation when we have capable backups, in Harker and Bennett, to go out there and get the job done.</p>
      <p>“We have a great team. I’ve talked about it all year. We have a very talented team. If I’m unable to go tomorrow, that doesn’t mean that we’re going to lose this game. We have a really talented football team and we’re going to see that tomorrow.</p>
      <p>“I’m going to wake up, see how I feel, and kind of go from there.”</p>
      <p>Fajardo said the pain is “pretty tremendous” when he throws.</p>
      <p>“That’s one of the things that you think about,” he said. “Obviously, another thing is if I go out there and happen to injure it even significantly more than what it already is, then we’re talking about my season being over.</p>
      <p>“So for me, personally, I would rather go out dying in a playoff game than I would in a regular-season game. That decision hasn’t been made yet. I’ve got an opportunity tomorrow to wake up and hopefully I feel great, but that’s for tomorrow.”</p>
