      <h1>All Overwatch cosmetics will carry over to Overwatch 2</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T21:29:23+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 21:29</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/author/wes-fenlon/" target="_blank">Wes Fenlon</a></address>
      <p>Overwatch's heroes have assembled some big wardrobes since 2016: Hundreds of skins, along with other cosmetics that keep players opening loot boxes and coming back for seasonal events. Now we know that <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/overwatch-2-release-date-trailer-everything-we-know/">Overwatch 2</a> is coming, and it's a full-on sequel, with new co-op modes in addition to PvP multiplayer. Overwatch 2 could've been a clean slate that wiped away all those skins and the hundreds or thousands of hours it took to collect them, but that's not how it's going down.</p>
      <p>"For all original players of the current Overwatch game, you will get to play on all of the same maps as Overwatch 2 players, including all the brand new maps that are coming to Overwatch 2, and you'll get to play with all of the same heroes as Overwatch 2 players," said Jeff Kaplan, Overwatch's lead designer.</p>
      <p>And the same goes for skins: "We want to make sure that all Overwatch cosmetics come forward with you into Overwatch 2, so all your progress matters. Nothing gets left behind."</p>
      <p>Kaplan called this a new approach to making a sequel. Overwatch 2's co-op modes are its big draw, while the sequel will have a "shared multiplayer environment" with the first game. If your Overwatch closet is stuffed full of skins, tags, and other cosmetics, that's probably a big reliefâ€”though it does make us wonder about how overstuffed Overwatch 2 may end up feeling a few years down the road.</p>
