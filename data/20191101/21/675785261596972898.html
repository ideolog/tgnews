      <h1>England's Rugby World Cup heroes have won us over with squad diversity and on-field grit</h1>
      <h2>England will face South Africa in the Rugby World Cup final on Saturday morning in Yokohama, Japan</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T21:00:00+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 21:00</time> by <a rel="author">Emily Retter, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/emily-retter/</a></address>
      <p>A bacon bap with a pint is truly a pairing made in heaven – as millions of us joyfully rediscovered this morning.</p>
      <p>We’ve waited many a year for that mouth-watering combination before elevenses when we settled down in front of big screens in bleach-smelling pubs across the land for the FIFA World Cup in South Korea and Japan in 2002.</p>
      <p>And who can forget a year later when England last lifted the Rugby World Cup in 2003 in Australia against the host nation with Jonny Wilkinson’s last-gasp drop goal.</p>
      <p>The fact Japan’s Rugby World Cup is the perfect excuse to go to the pub for breakfast is one reason rugby fever is bubbling at a boiling point for the final between England and South Africa.</p>
      <p>Even for those of us, ahem, who don’t really have a clue what’s going on and find ourselves humming Baddiel and Skinner’s Three Lions – a dead giveaway, by the way, for actual rugby fans.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>But there’s something deeper behind what has fast developed into a really beautiful national mood illuminating these grim autumn days.</p>
      <p>And didn’t we need it...</p>
      <p>Maybe, it’s because at a time of hostility and division in our ­politics, there is an unexpected unity and hopefulness bouncing off England’s quietly confident bruising backs and forwards.</p>
      <p>That surprisingly self-assured V-shaped response to New Zealand’s semi-final haka ­definitely helped. But there’s something else more deep-rooted.</p>
      <p>If you attended a state school, rugby probably didn’t make much of an impression.</p>

      <p>That weird ­egg-shaped ball wasn’t round. And it wasn’t ours.</p>
      <p>Rugger belonged, and still belongs, on the whole, to a Harry Potter land of prefects and fags.</p>
      <p>But this current England team shouts something different.</p>
      <p>Here, unlike the Cabinet, the winning team aren’t all privileged, posh boys reeking of Bullingdon Club-style initiations.</p>
      <p>Captain Owen Farrell hails from Wigan, where his Rugby League player dad was just 16 when he had him.</p>
      <p>Kyle Sinckler is from a Tooting housing estate, where he saw pals end up in gangs.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Jack Nowell’s dad is a Cornish fisherman. In fact, 22 of the squad led by Eddie Jones were at state schools for the bulk of their secondary education.</p>
      <p>And perhaps it’s the ever-so polite, sweetly enthusiastic ­Japanese crowds who have rubbed off, but there’s not been a whiff of entitled bad behaviour in sight.</p>
      <p>They’re an ethnically diverse squad, too. More than a third of the players are from BAME ­backgrounds. As such, they have gifted ­opportunity to us all.</p>
      <p>Maro Itoje lit the touch paper when he said: “No man is an island, whenever you want to make positive strides forward you always have to do it together.</p>
      <p>“Dividing people never works... Unity is always the best way forward.”</p>
      <p>That sentiment, digested with a rasher of streaky and washed down with a foamy top, is why we’re all suddenly so enamoured with the egg-shaped ball.</p>
