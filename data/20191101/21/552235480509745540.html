      <h1>Hibs squad revealed as Martin Boyle to be assessed ahead of Celtic clash</h1>
      <h2>Paul Heckingbottom bids to ease the pressure on his shoulders by reaching the Betfred Cup Final.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T21:30:22+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 21:30</time> by <a rel="author">Record Sport Online</a></address>
      <p>Hibs boss <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/paul-heckingbottom">Paul Heckingbottom</a> reported "a lot of knocks" to unnamed players ahead of Saturday's <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/betfred-league-cup">Betfred Cup</a> semi-final against Celtic.</p>
      <p>Martin Boyle will be assessed after coming off the bench to net a late equaliser against Livingston on Wednesday on his comeback from a long-term knee problem.</p>
      <p>Midfielder Vykintas Slivka is at a similar stage as Boyle following an ankle break but <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hibernian-fc">Hibs</a> defenders Darren McGregor (abdomen) and David Gray (knee) are still out.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> , meanwhile, are sweating over the fitness of skipper Scott Brown after he picked up an injury.</p>
      <p>Mikey Johnston, however, could return to action.</p>
