      <p>The Waterbury Police Department <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/man-arrested-allegedly-handing-out-razor-blades-halloween-candy-n1075201">said</a> 37-year-old Jason Racz was taken into custody after residents reportedly found razors inside two of their children’s Halloween candy baskets, according to NBC News.</p>
      <p>Upon further investigation, officials <a href="https://myfox8.com/2019/11/01/man-arrested-after-razor-blades-found-in-kids-halloween-baskets/">said</a> they determined that the razors came from the same home located at 102 Horseshoe Drive.</p>
      <p>However, no razor blades were found outside the candy and no injuries were <a href="https://abc7ny.com/arrest-made-after-children-find-razor-blades-in-candy/5664423/">reported</a> at the time, according to Chief Fernando Spagnola.</p>
      <p>“Racz explained that the razor blades were accidentally spilled or put into the candy bowl he used to hand out candy from,” the department said in a statement, adding that Racz “provided no explanation as to how the razor blades were handed out to the children along with the candy.”</p>
      <p>Police <a href="https://www.wfsb.com/news/waterbury-police-make-arrest-after-razor-blades-found-in-candy/article_328f8938-fc53-11e9-a0a5-1749a546a400.html">learned</a> during the investigation that a three-year-old child living at the home had access to a box of razor blades. The container was later seized as evidence.</p>
      <p>Officers also said they were forced to restrain Racz while they booked him on Thursday evening.</p>
      <p>The suspect was charged with risk of injury to a minor, reckless endangerment, and interfering with a police officer. He is being held on a $250,000 bond until his arraignment in court on Friday.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, Breitbart News <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/crime/2019/10/29/police-suspected-bag-heroin-found-childs-halloween-bag/">reported</a> that a parent in Middle Township, New Jersey, found what they suspected to be a bag of heroin in their child’s candy bag after attending a Halloween event at a local community center on October 25.</p>
      <p>However, Middle Township Police Capt. William Adams said the substance in question had not been tested to determine whether it was heroin.</p>
      <p>Following the incident, the department urged parents “to check their children’s candy bags thoroughly and contact the police if they discover anything suspicious, harmful or out of the ordinary.”</p>
