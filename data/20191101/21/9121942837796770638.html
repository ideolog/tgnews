      <p>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — Harrison Barnes scored on an offensive rebound with 2.9 seconds remaining after Nemanja Bjelica’s missed 3-pointer, and the Sacramento Kings won their first game of the season, beating the Utah Jazz 102-101 on Friday night.</p>
      <p>Donovan Mitchell’s desperation 3-pointer at the buzzer grazed the front of the rim.</p>
      <p>De’Aaron Fox scored 25 points, Buddy Hield had 18 and Bogdan Bogdanovic added 14 to help the Kings (1-5) end their worst start in nearly 30 years. Sacramento entered the game as the only winless team in the NBA.</p>
      <p>It wasn’t all pretty.</p>
      <p>Sacramento committed 17 turnovers, made only 12 of 17 free throws and was outscored 13-5 over the final 5 minutes.</p>
      <p>Mitchell had 24 points for the Jazz (4-2). Rudy Gobert added 15 points and 16 rebounds, and Mike Conley scored 19.</p>
      <p>Nearly a week after getting blown out by the Jazz 113-81 in Salt Lake City, the Kings built an early lead, nearly gave it all away, then made a pair of big plays down the stretch to win.</p>
      <p>Utah trailed 97-88 before scoring nine straight to tie the game on Mitchell’s 22-foot jumper. After Dewayne Dedmon made a 3-pointer for Sacramento, Mitchell fed Gobert for an alley-oop dunk, then scorred on a layup to put the Jazz up 101-100 with 11.2 seconds left.</p>
      <p>Bjelica, who made three 3s earlier in the game, missed from the left corner with the clock running down, but Harrison grabbed the rebound and scored the winner.</p>
      <p>It’s the first time in six games that Utah has allowed more than 100 points.</p>
      <p>SEVEN AND OH NO</p>
      <p>Sacramento had trouble taking care of the ball and committed seven turnovers in the first quarter. The upside? Utah failed to score a single point off the mistakes.</p>
      <p>TIP-INS</p>
      <p>Jazz: Ed Davis scored eight points in 21 minutes before leaving the game with a left lower leg contusion. . Jeff Green made a buzzer-beating 3-pointer to end the third quarter. . Coach Quin Snyder was called for a technical when he angrily stormed onto the court after Jeff Green was called for an offensive foul in the third quarter.</p>
      <p>Kings: Fox made a nice move to shake Conley and left the Utah guard standing at the 3-point line, but missed an open dunk and the ball ricocheted to the other end of the court.</p>
      <p>UP NEXT</p>
      <p>Jazz: Play at the Clippers for the second time in five days on Sunday. Utah beat Los Angeles 110-96 on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Kings: Begin a three-game trip Sunday against the Knicks at Madison Square Garden. Sacramento has won three straight against New York.</p>
