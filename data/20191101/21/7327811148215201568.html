      <p>HILLSDALE, New Jersey (WABC) -- Authorities say a woman who was cleaning a birdbath had to be rescued after she fell down a well in her back yard.</p>
      <p>The incident happened on Trinity Place around 11 a.m. on Friday and officials say the well had been buried.</p>
      <p>A construction crew that was working on her deck heard her fall in and called police.</p>
      <p>The woman, in her 60s, was down the well for about 45 minutes before first responders were able to get her out.</p>
      <p>They used a haul system to lift her to safety.</p>
      <p>"She was completely alert and conscious, we were talking and had a nice conversation, we called her husband twice to try to get him to let her dogs out," one of the rescuers said.</p>
      <p>Police say if it weren't for the construction worker who heard her screams, she could have been down in the well for hours.</p>
      <p>She said she had walked in the same spot more than 100 times and never realized there was a well.</p>
      <p>The woman was taken to the hospital, but officials say she only suffered minor injuries.</p>
      <p>Construction workers have since placed wood over the hole to make it more obvious.</p>
