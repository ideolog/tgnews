      <p>MOTT HAVEN, Bronx (WABC) -- Police say a suspect is in custody after a woman was brutally attacked in the Bronx with a metal pipe and a boy was slammed to the ground.</p>
      <p>24-year-old Manuel Jimenez is charged with attempted murder and acting in a manner injurious to a child less than 17.</p>
      <p>The woman was walking near Walton Avenue and East 144th Street in the Mott Haven section at around 3 p.m. when the man approached her from behind.</p>
      <p>He then hit her with a metal pipe. The 58-year-old victim suffered a broken arm and was taken to the hospital.</p>
      <p>It's not the first time the suspect hurt someone, according to investigators.</p>
      <p>The week prior, police say that around 1:30 p.m. near Willis Avenue and East 144th Street, he approached a 13-year-old boy.</p>
      <p>He apparently put his hands over the victim's eyes and slammed him to the ground.</p>
      <p>"He just covers my face and just tackles me on the ground," said the boy, 'Angel'. He is a brave 9th-grader in the South Bronx who managed to keep himiself safe in the attack and suffered minor injuries.</p>
      <p>Residents along East 144th Street, where the attacks occurred, recognized the suspect as an emotionally disturbed man receiving treatment in the area.</p>
      <p>"He has his moments but we didn't' know he'd have his moments like coming over here and hurting people," said South Bronx resident Jasmine Cruz.</p>
      <p>"He's got his own psych and everything, I don't know why he's doing this," said South Bronx resident Miguel Pagan.</p>
      <p>Surveillance video shows the suspect sticking around with Angel for a full minute after he attacked him, even hugging him at one point, apologizing.</p>
      <p>"He said, 'Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry..you're the wrong one," said Angel.</p>
      <p>Angel and his family tell us the man also professed to be a police officer.</p>
      <p>"Basically saying, 'oh I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm a cop and these streets are dangerous," said Angel's cousin Daniel Romero.</p>
      <p>"So he definitely told you he was a cop at one point?", we asked Angel.</p>
      <p>"Yeah, but I'm pretty sure he's not," he said.</p>
