      <p>President <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/donald-trump">Donald Trump </a>resumed his attacks on the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/federal-reserve">Federal Reserve </a>and its Chairman Jerome Powell, a day after it cut interest rates for the third time this year.</p>
      <p>"People are VERY disappointed in Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve," Trump tweeted Thursday. “The Fed has called it wrong from the beginning, too fast, too slow."</p>
      <p>Fed officials reduced interest rates by a quarter-percentage point Wednesday and signaled a pause in further cuts unless the economic outlook changes materially.</p>
      <p>While economic growth has moderated this year -- in part due to weakness in manufacturing caused by uncertainty over Trump’s trade policies -- unemployment has continued to drop, consumer spending has remained solid, and the rate cuts this year have made mortgages more affordable and revived the housing market.</p>
