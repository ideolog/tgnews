      <p>Meng, 47, is charged in the United States with bank fraud and she is accused of misleading HSBC Holdings PLC (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/HSBA.L">HSBA.L</a>) about Huawei Technologies Co Ltd’s business in Iran, which is under U.S. sanctions. Meng has said she is innocent and is fighting extradition.</p>
      <p>In early October Meng and her lawyers asserted that members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) had illegally shared sensitive identifying information about her electronic devices with the FBI.</p>
      <p>“The applicant’s allegation that the information was shared by the RCMP with the FBI is unfounded,” lawyers for Canada’s attorney general said in court documents released to media on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Huawei was not available for an immediate comment.</p>
      <p>Canada’s attorney general filed eight affidavits this month stating that members of the FBI and RCMP were discussing what information would be necessary in the case of a mutual legal assistance treaty request is made by the United States, which is made by one country to another when requiring the exchange of information to enforce laws.</p>
      <p>The RCMP did not share the information, the affidavits written by past and present members of the police force stated.</p>
      <p>The lawyers for Canada’s attorney general added in their letter that the information being gathered but not shared showed a “good faith attempt” by the RCMP “to ensure that any sharing would be done in accordance with the law.”</p>
      <p>Meng and her lawyers returned to a British Columbia court this month, requesting additional documents pertaining to Meng’s arrest at the Vancouver International Airport at the request of the United States on Dec. 1, 2018.</p>
      <p>Meng’s argument is part of a broader strategy to prove that her arrest was illegal and violated her rights according to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.</p>
      <p>If Canadian officials abused their authority, her lawyers say, the extradition proceedings should be halted. The official extradition trial will begin in January 2020.</p>
      <p>“In any event, the allegations could not result in the most drastic of remedies, a stay of proceedings,” the lawyers for Canadian attorney general said.</p>
