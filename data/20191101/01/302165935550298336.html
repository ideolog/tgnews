      <p>LOS ANGELES, Nov 1 — The American actress, who left the series’ cast in 2018, will be back for one of the eighth season’s episodes, according to reports by US outlets.</p>
      <p>Raymund’s character Gabriela made her last appearance during the seventh season’s first episode, as she said her goodbyes to former husband Matt Casey after taking a job helping hurricane relief teams in Puerto Rico.</p>
      <p>Gabriela’s return to Chicago is prompted by a fundraiser benefiting her humanitarian organisation. She will be making a stop by the firehouse to visit her former colleagues, Matt among them.</p>
      <p>“Fans can expect sparks to fly from the Dawson and Casey reunion. Dawson and Casey will always have an unbreakable bond, and their love is a special love that I think will forever stay alive. The fans don’t want to miss this episode — we get to seep Dawson and Casey’s love in a new light,” Raymund said to <i>Entertainment Weekly</i>.</p>
      <p>It is not clear whether Raymund will be coming back to the Dick Wolf-produced series on a permanent basis. She had been part of the cast since the NBC series’ launch back in 2012.</p>
      <p><i>Chicago Fire</i> is currently in its eighth season, which debuted in September 2019.</p>
      <p>The episode will be broadcast at the end of November 2019, just before the mid-season hiatus. — AFP-Relaxnews</p>
