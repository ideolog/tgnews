      <p><a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Aishwarya-Rai">Aishwarya Rai</a> Bachchan is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful actresses in <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Bollywood">Bollywood</a>. The star is celebrating her 46th <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/birthday">birthday</a> today and her fans can't keep calm. Several fan clubs on social media dedicated to the '<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Ae-Dil-Hai-Mushkil">Ae Dil Hai Mushkil</a>' actress have shared some unseen pictures of the diva and we are all hearts!</p>
      <p>Apart from a talented actress and a loving wife, Aishwarya is a doting mother to her daughter Aaradhya. Aaradhya is often seen accompanying her mother on most of the occasions. We scrolled her <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Instagram">Instagram</a> profile closely and stumbled upon something that might interest you. The star often shares photos of her little princess and her admirers can't stop praising this mother-daughter duo. Every often, they twin in similar colour outfits and it is too adorable for words! Aaradhya looks cute as a button as she twins and we can already see a fashionista in making like her Aishwarya.</p>
      <p>We totally love how they shell out major <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/mother-daughter-goals">mother-daughter goals</a> with their fashion outings, tell us how did you like it in the comment section below.</p>
