      <p><b>RIO DE JANEIROÂ (AP)</b> - A son of Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro faced criticism Thursday after suggesting the government adopt dictatorship-era tactics if they are deemed necessary to control any street protests.</p>
      <p>Lawmaker Eduardo Bolsonaro said protests and riots of the kind that have occurred in several other Latin American countries could be stopped if they ever happen in Brazil.</p>
      <p>In comments broadcast Thursday on social media, the president's son recommended a decree similar to one issued in 1968 by Brazil's military dictatorship. The decree stripped opposition lawmakers of political rights and suspended some constitutional guarantees.</p>
      <p>Eduardo Bolsonaro said the decree could be introduced "if the left radicalizes to that point."</p>
      <p>Bolsonaro is the leader of his father's Social Liberal Party in Congress' lower house.</p>
      <p>Politicians from all sides, including the heads of the Lower House and Senate, as well as a Supreme Court justice, repudiated the comments as anti-democratic. President Bolsonaro himself said in a televised interview he regretted his son's comments, and Eduardo Bolsonaro later apologized.</p>
      <p>Still, a sprinkling of protesters gathered Thursday evening on Sao Paulo's main street to oppose the far-right government. Leftist groups have organized 16 protests in 11 states, starting with Sao Paulo and Brasilia.</p>
      <p>"I am here to fight for democracy. This country is going the wrong way," said Joyce Fernandes, a 24-years-old law student. "I want to see this country say there will never be a dictatorship again. There is just too much, I am fed up."</p>
