      <p>LONDON: England's 1966 World Cup winners, former captains and most capped players have been invited to celebrate the country's 1,000th international against Montenegro in November.</p>
      <p>The Euro 2020 qualifier at Wembley will see England become the first country to reach 1,000 senior men's internationals.</p>

      <p>147 years since the first against Scotland, the English Football Association are marking the occasion in a number of ways, including recognising the notable contributions of former internationals while the current crop will wear individual 'legacy numbers' on their shirts.</p>
      <p>England manager Gareth Southgate, who represented his country 57 times and has the legacy number 1,071, believes the NovÂ 14 qualifier will be an occasion to remember.</p>
      <p>"It encapsulates the history and the importance of the team going back right the way through," Southgate said.</p>
      <p>"We always talk to the players about the badge on the front of the shirt and how we are a small part of that history.</p>
      <p>"It's important we respect the shirt and leave it in a better place than when we found it. So, to be involved in this game is a particularly poignant moment, especially given that some of our great former players will be at the match."</p>
