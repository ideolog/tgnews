      <p>Bloody Sunday, also referred to as the Bogside Massacre, took place on January 30, 1972, in Derry, Northern Ireland, when British soldiers shot 28 unarmed civilians protesting against internment. A total of 14 people died.</p>

      <p>​An image of the ad was first posted on Twitter by a user who saw it at one <a href="https://sputniknews.com/business/201908011076424155-mcdonalds-banned-from-historical-sites-in-rome--report/">McDonald’s</a> location in Portugal.</p>
      <p>"When promoting its Halloween Sundae ice cream, <a href="https://sputniknews.com/viral/201910021076946349-thats-a-diet-aid-lovin-it-netizens-freak-out-over-japanese-sexy-ronald-mcdonald-ad/">McDonald's</a> Portugal developed a local market activation for a small number of its restaurants in Portugal,” a spokesperson for <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201910251077152665-video-ohio-mcdonalds-manager-violently-flings-blender-at-disgruntled-customer/">McDonald’s</a> said in a <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/mcdonalds-apologises-for-sunday-bloody-sundae-campaign-11850245">recent statement.</a></p>
      <p>"The campaign was intended as a celebration of Halloween, not as an insensitive reference to any historical event or to upset or insult anyone in any way,” the statement added.</p>
      <p>This is not the first time reference to the massacre has caused an outcry.</p>
      <p>A London bar apologized back in 2013 for serving a “Sundae Bloody Sundae” cocktail with a toy soldier.</p>
