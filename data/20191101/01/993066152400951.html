      <p>PLANS to house 13 female asylum seekers in a Co Mayo hotel have been postponed due to continuing protests at the site.</p>
      <p>The Achill Head Hotel in Keel had been selected as a location to provide emergency temporary accommodation for the women for up to three months.</p>
      <p>In a statement the Department of Justice and Equality said the plan was being put on hold because "an ongoing protest remains in place outside the hotel".</p>
      <p>The department expressed disappointment, but said it would continue to engage with local representatives in a bid to resolve the matter.</p>
      <p>Last week, a public meeting in Achill heard fears of infrastructural pressures as a result of asylum seekers being moved to the community.</p>
      <p>Sinn Féin senator Rose Conway-Walsh told RTÉ there had been a "vacuum of information" and the postponement gave the government an opportunity to "get this right".</p>
