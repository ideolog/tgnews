      <p>GARDA representatives have called for more officers to be deployed in border areas following the recent attacks and threats.</p>
      <p>Concerns have been raised following renewed threats the directors of Quinn Industrial Holdings, as well as incidents such as Sinn Féin TD Martin Kenny's car being burnt out and a fire at Emyvale Garda Station.</p>
      <p>Antoinette Cunningham, from the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, said her colleagues in Donegal, Cavan, Monaghan and Louth are "extremely concerned" about policing along the border.</p>
      <p>James Morrisroe of the Garda Representative Association called for more "gardaí on the beat", telling RTÉ: "We need to get frontline, uniformed gardaí back into the communities."</p>
      <p>Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said the government had increased garda resources along the border and would do so again.</p>
      <p>He said recent "lawlessness" in the region was being treated with the "utmost seriousness".</p>
