      <p>LOS ANGELES, Nov 1 — <i>Variety </i>reports that the <i>Amazing Spider-Man</i> and <i>The Social Network</i> star is joining the cast of composer-lyricist-playwright Lin-Manuel Miranda’s first feature film, set to be released by Netflix.</p>
      <p>Netflix has acquired the rights to musical comedy <i>Tick Tick Boom</i>, written by Jonathan Larson, who created the famous musical <i>Rent</i> in 1996. The 1990 autobiographical play tells aspiring New York composer Jon’s own story, as he sets out to write the next great American musical, entitled <i>Superbia</i>. As he nears his thirtieth birthday, anxiety takes over, leading him to wonder if the project is even worth pursuing.</p>
      <p><i>Fosse/Verdon</i>’s Steven Levenson will be handling screenwriting duties for the adaptation.</p>
      <p>Miranda, who wrote the hit musical <i>Hamilton: An American Musical</i>, which has been running on Broadway since 2015, will direct.</p>
      <p>Garfield will play the role of Jon. The actor has just wrapped up shooting on <i>Mainstream</i> and is about to begin production on <i>The Eyes of Tammy Faye</i> alongside Jessica Chastain. — AFP-Relaxnews</p>
