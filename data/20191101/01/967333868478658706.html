      <p>While <a href="https://sputniknews.com/viral/201910311077184960-photos-twitter-explodes-after-trump-posts-doctored-image-of-dog-wounded-in-baghdadi-raid/">many netizens had something to say</a> about Trump reposting the image originally doctored by the Daily Wire, 45 took to Twitter on Thursday and countered claims that he was frightened to be around the military dog by announcing the pooch would be visiting the White House “sometime next week.”</p>
      <p>However, in usual Trump fashion, he stirred up more social media controversy by calling the Belgian Malinois by his name - “Conan.”</p>

      <p>Many previously speculated that the dog’s name would remain classified, as it would be possible for those seeking revenge to use the canine’s information to identify US troops involved in the Baghdadi military operation. Indeed, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley <a href="https://sputniknews.com/viral/201910291077169794-trump-hails-wonderful-dog-injured-during-baghdadi-raid/">previously declined</a> to share the dog’s name for security reasons. Despite the recent outrage, <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/classified-name-dog-wounded-syria-isis-baghdadi-raid-revealed-1468238">Newsweek</a> previously cited “multiple Defense Department sources” in confirming that Conan was indeed the dog’s name.</p>
