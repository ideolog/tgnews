      <p>HUNTINGTON STATION, Long Island (WABC) -- Meet the newest Eyewitness News reporter!</p>
      <p>Meteorologist Lee Goldberg told the Eyewitness News team that we needed to bolster our reporter staff for Halloween, so we called up 8-year-old Peyton Dilbert to give us the latest from Long Island.</p>
      <p>From Huntington Station, Peyton told Channel 7 viewers that they should expect clouds and mild weather.</p>
      <p>"It's not too cold. It's not too hot," he said during his live report.</p>
      <p>He also predicted plenty of M&amp;M's and Reese's Pieces in the trick-or-treating forecast.</p>
      <p>This Halloween, Peyton dressed up as an Eyewitness News reporter -- with our signature Circle 7 microphone included. We found him after his dad tweeted a photo of the costume and tagged the Eyewitness News Weekend Morning team.</p>
      <p>"My Son Loves watching you guys in the morning!!!!! He wants to be a ABC 7 reporter," he tweeted.</p>

      <p>Unfortunately, Peyton won't be able to stay with us -- he needs to finish the third grade! Yet make sure to tune into Channel 7 in 2039 -- right now, he's slated to be N.J. Burkett's replacement!</p>
