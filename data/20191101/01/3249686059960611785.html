      <p><a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/seven-oclock">Seven O'clock</a> have wrapped up their first round of individual member teaser images for their upcoming 3rd mini album, '<b>White Night</b>'!</p>
      <p>The group's final two members up to share a set of moody, wintry images are <b>Andy</b> and <b>2Soul</b>. On one side, the two Seven O'clock members can be seen sitting idly in a realistic universe, surrounded by an overall green color palette. On the other side, the two members seem to exist in a more dreamlike universe, taking on an overall purplish color tone. </p>
      <p>What do you think of Seven O'clock's comeback teaser photos so far? The group's 3rd mini album 'White Night' is set for release this November 12 at 6 PM KST. </p>
