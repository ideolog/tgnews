      <p>Amazon must decide soon <a href="https://apnews.com/a3d7a26c6f0642089dfc3f43b60a60e1">if it will protest</a> the Pentagon's <a href="https://yro.slashdot.org/story/19/10/26/0151216/microsoft-beats-amazon-to-win-the-pentagons-10-billion-jedi-cloud-contract">awarding of a $10 billion cloud computing contract to rival Microsoft</a>, with one possible grievance being the unusual attention given the project by President Donald Trump. From a report:<i> Amazon was long thought to be the front-runner in the competition for the huge military contract. Its Amazon Web Services division is far ahead of second-place Microsoft in cloud computing, and Amazon has experience handling highly classified government data. It survived earlier legal challenges after the Defense Department eliminated rival bidders Oracle and IBM and whittled the competition down to the two Seattle area tech giants before choosing Microsoft last week. And what else distinguishes the losing bidder? Amazon and its CEO Jeff Bezos, who also owns The Washington Post, <a href="https://politics.slashdot.org/story/17/06/28/1540239/president-trump-attacks-amazon-incorrectly-claiming-that-it-owns-the-washington-post-for-tax-purposes">have been frequent targets of Trump's criticism</a>. The Pentagon was preparing to make its final decision when Trump publicly waded into the fray in July, saying he had heard complaints about the process and that the administration would "<a href="https://news.slashdot.org/story/19/07/18/1930215/trump-says-hes-looking-into-a-pentagon-cloud-contract-for-amazon-or-microsoft">take a very long look</a>." He said other companies told him that the contract "wasn't competitively bid." Oracle, in particular, had <a href="https://tech.slashdot.org/story/19/07/02/1953240/oracle-on-why-it-thinks-aws-winning-pentagons-10-billion-jedi-cloud-contract-stinks">argued that Pentagon officials unfairly favored Amazon</a> for the winner-take-all contract.</i></p>
