      <p>WASHINGTON: The US Department of the Interior has grounded its fleet of Chinese-made drones as it conducts a review of the program.</p>
      <p>Nick Goodwin, an Interior Department spokesman, did not provide a reason for the decision but it comes amid US security concerns over Chinese electronics.</p>

      <p>Goodwin said the review had been ordered by Interior Department Secretary David Bernhardt.</p>
      <p>"Until this review is completed, the Secretary has directed that drones manufactured in China or made from Chinese components be grounded," he said.</p>
      <p>Exceptions would be made for drones that are being used for emergency purposes such as fighting wildfires, search and rescue, and dealing with natural disasters, Goodwin said.</p>
      <p>According to sources familiar with the program, the Interior Department has a fleet of 810 drones, almost all built by Chinese companies.</p>
      <p>Only 24 are US-made and even those have Chinese electronic components, the sources said.</p>
      <p>The US Department of Homeland Security issued a warning in May that Chinese-made drones could pose a security risk.</p>
      <p>The United States has also taken steps against China's Huawei by effectively banning American companies from selling or transferring US technology to the Chinese telecoms giant.</p>
      <p>US intelligence believes Huawei is backed by the Chinese military and that its equipment could provide Beijing's spy agencies with a backdoor into the communications networks of other countries.</p>
      <p>China's foreign ministry said Friday that it was "still seeking further understanding of the specific situation" but called for the US to provide a "non-discriminatory environment for Chinese companies".</p>
      <p>"We urge the US to stop abusing the concept of national security, stop exaggerating the so-called China threat, and stop oppressing Chinese companies without reason," foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said at a regular press briefing.</p>
      <p>The Chinese company DJI produces about 70 per cent of the world's commercial drones.</p>
      <p>"We're very disappointed," a DJI spokeswoman told AFP, adding that the company had no other comment for now.</p>
      <p>The Pentagon has banned the military from using DJI drones for security reasons since 2017.</p>
