      <h3>Netflix customers are being warned about a fraudulent email doing the rounds asking for updated payment information.</h3>
      <p>According to 9 News:</p>
      <blockquote>Victims are told they are required to update their payment information to continue using the service.<br/><br/>"We recommend that you update your payment information immediately to secure your account otherwise you will not be able to use our services," the email reads.<br/><br/>A link is provided for users to change their payment details, which takes unsuspecting victims to a Netflix branded log-in page when clicked.<br/><br/>Users are prompted to login using their account credentials â€“ doing so takes them to another phishing page asking for their credit card details.<br/><br/>If the victim enters their credit card information, cyber criminals will harvest their confidential payment data alongside their Netflix login information.</blockquote>
