      <p>A Scots mum has tragically been diagnosed with <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/cancer">cancer</a> for the second time - just weeks after giving birth to her 'miracle' baby.</p>
      <p>Jolene Patrick, 30, was delighted to welcome her baby girl Emmeline to the world on August 22 after being told by doctors that her intense treatment for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/cancer">breast cancer</a> in 2017 could prevent her from having children.</p>
      <p>However, Jolene's world came crashing down for a second time earlier this month, when little Emmeline had just turned 8 weeks old, as doctors told her the devastating news that her cancer had returned and had already spread to her lymph nodes, liver, ribs, lungs and bones.</p>

      <p>Jolene, from <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/falkirk">Stenhousemuir</a>, said she was just starting to feel like her life was getting back on track before her shock diagnosis.</p>
      <p>The mental health nurse added: "The last few years have been horrendous and I was just starting to feel like I was getting my life back and now this has happend.</p>
      <p>"I've got to just take every day as it comes. I've fought it once before and I'll try my hardest to do it again. I've got Emiline to focus on now.</p>
      <p>"Right now we're just trying to stay positive and are continuing to make memories as we don't know what's going to happen."</p>

      <p>Jolene, of Stenhousemuir, opted out of freezing her eggs before her intense chemotherapy sessions in 2017 because she didn't want to delay her treatment.</p>
      <p>She was told by doctors that this would reduce her chances of conceiving naturally, however she and her husband Alan were delighted to find out they were expecting a baby just six months after Jolene was given the all clear in March 2018.</p>
      <p>Jolene added: "The pregnancy was definitely not planned. We did not expect it to happen because of everything I had been through.</p>
      <p>"We were over the moon. She's our little miracle and is so loved.</p>
      <p>"She's a brilliant baby. We're so lucky to have her."</p>
      <p>Jolene was first diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer in June 2017 almost a year after marrying Alan.</p>
      <p>The then 28-year-old underwent a mastectomy and endured several rounds of gruelling chemotherapy.</p>

      <p>She added: "The chemotherapy was awful the last time. If I had a gun I would have used it. I felt dreadful. So, so bad."</p>
      <p>Jolene's best friend Julie McGregor has now started a fundraising page to help ease the financial burden for Jolene and Alan.</p>
      <p>She said: "A few of our friends have came together to do this for them. It's all we can do to help.</p>
      <p>"Unfortunately we can't take away what she's going through so this is the least we can do.</p>
      <p>"We're heartbroken for her. She doesn't deserve this. She's amazing and is so loved.</p>
      <p>"We want her to know we are all here and will do whatever we can to ease any financial stress they might have.</p>
      <p>"She doesn't need to be worrying about money as well as everything else."</p>
      <p>Jolene said she has been overwhelmed by the donations.</p>
      <p>She added: "I'm so grateful. I have so many brilliant people in my life. My family, my friends and my husband Alan have been amazing the last few years. I'm really lucky to have them."</p>
