      <p>A mum who ballooned to a <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/east-kilbride-mums-nine-stone-20648800">size 22</a> during her unhappy marriage is now celebrating losing five stone – and divorcing after 16 years.</p>
      <p>Lou Bentley, 36, has marked the huge change in her life by showing off her <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/east-kilbride-mums-nine-stone-20648800">size 10 figure</a> and revealing how she slimmed down from 14st 7lb to 9st 10lb.</p>
      <p>She said: “I think I’m the best I have ever been. I feel happier than ever and look better than I did when I was younger.”</p>
      <p>Lou, from Melton Mowbray, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/east-kilbride-mums-nine-stone-20648800">Leics</a>, who is 5ft 3in, had struggled with her weight in her teens and suffered bulimia, losing then regaining four stone.</p>
      <p>But it was after marrying her soldier ex that her cravings for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/east-kilbride-mums-nine-stone-20648800">fast food</a> ran out of control.</p>

      <p>Leaving her family behind to live on a base in Germany was one blow.</p>
      <p>Having to raise their kids alone while he served in Afghanistan was another.</p>
      <p>By the time of her third child, she was size 22, lonely and depressed. But as her marriage faltered in 2010, she beat her craving for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/east-kilbride-mums-nine-stone-20648800">chips</a> and became hooked on exercise instead, installing a home gym and using a <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/east-kilbride-mums-nine-stone-20648800">Wii Fit</a>.</p>
      <p>“I was sick of not being able to look in the mirror,” she said. “I never did my hair or make-up.”</p>
      <p>She started counting ­calories, having an egg on wholemeal bread for breakfast, chicken and rice for lunch and lean steak with sweet potatoes for dinner instead of chips.</p>

      <p>“Now I take so much more pride in my appearance, says <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/east-kilbride-mums-nine-stone-20648800">Lou</a>, a part-time supervisor for a cleaning firm.</p>
      <p>“I get up at 6am and do 30 minutes on the treadmill then 45 minutes of weights.”</p>
      <p>Her divorce was finalised amicably last week and her ­children treated her to a special cake.</p>
      <p>While she has a new relationship, she says she doesn’t need a man to be happy.</p>
      <p>“I’m very independent and I do feel really proud of myself,” she said.</p>
