      <p>NEW YORK: Wall Street stocks finished lower on Thursday (Oct 31) as worries over global growth and the US-China trade war offset strong earnings reports from Apple and Facebook.</p>
      <p>The S&amp;P 500 had closed at a record on Wednesday following a Federal Reserve interest rate cut but analysts said the subsequent pullback suggested unease that the Fed signaled it would hold off on further interest rate cuts.</p>

      <p>"The market now is concerned we are still seeing some slowness," said Stephanie Lewicky, a senior manager of futures and forex at TD Ameritrade.</p>
      <p>"And with Fed Chair Powell saying that we're probably going to pause for December, there's a little bit of concern."</p>
      <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 140.46 points (0.52 per cent) to 27,046.23.</p>
      <p>The broad-based S&amp;P 500 dropped 9.21 points (0.30 per cent) to 3,037.56, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index lost 11.62 points (0.14 per cent) at 8,292.36.</p>
      <p>Analysts said investors were also perturbed by a Bloomberg report that Chinese officials are skeptical of a long-term trade deal with the United States.</p>
      <p>Large industrial companies had a bad session, with Boeing and Caterpillar both losing 1.8 per cent and 3M 2.0 per cent.</p>
      <p>Apple gained 2.3 per cent as it reported better-than-expected results on strong growth in digital services and wearables that helped offset slower iPhone sales.</p>
      <p>Facebook climbed 1.8 per cent after reporting higher profits on a growing user base while controversy over the company's data collection practices and acceptance of political ads did not crimp results.</p>
      <p>Altria dropped 2.6 per cent as it announced a US$4.5 billion charge related to its investment in Juul, an e-cigarette company. The vaping business has come under scrutiny following a series of deaths connected to e-cigarettes.</p>
