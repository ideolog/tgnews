      <p>Pakistan Prime Minister <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/imran-khan">Imran Khan </a>on Friday announced that Sikh pilgrims from India would not need a passport to travel to <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/kartarpur">Kartarpur </a>and no fee would be charged from them on the opening day of the corridor on November 9.</p>
      <p>"For Sikhs coming for pilgrimage to <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/kartarpur">Kartarpur </a>from India, I have waived off two requirements: i) they won't need a passport-just a valid ID; ii)they no longer have to register 10 days in advance. Also, no fee to be charged on day of inauguration and on Guruji's 550th birthday," Khan tweeted.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/kartarpur">Kartarpur </a>Corridor will connect the Dera Baba Nanak shrine in India's Punjab with Darbar Sahib at Kartarpur, just 4 kilometres from the International Border, located at Narowal district of Pakistan's Punjab province.</p>
      <p>India and Pakistan last week signed the agreement on the Corridor that will allow Indian pilgrims to undertake visa-free visit to Gurdwara Darbar Sahib, the shrine of the Sikh religion's founder Guru Nanak Dev in Pakistan, notwithstanding a chill in bilateral ties over Kashmir.</p>
      <p>The agreement will allow 5,000 Indian pilgrims daily to visit Gurdwara Darbar Sahib where Guru Nanak spent last 18 years of his life.</p>
      <p>Each visitor would be required to pay $20 as fee, though India has requested Pakistan not to charge the Indian pilgrims.</p>
