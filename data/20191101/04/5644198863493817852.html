      <p>Pinterest Inc on Thursday fell short of Wall Street estimates for third-quarter revenue, sending its shares down 20per cent in extended trading.</p>
      <p>REUTERS: Pinterest Inc fell short of Wall Street estimates for quarterly revenue on lower-than-expected average revenue per user and its revised full-year sales forecast came marginally below expectations, sending its shares tumbling 19per cent.</p>
      <p>Thursday's after-market plunge is expected to wipe out a majority of the gains since the online scrapbook company's blockbuster initial public offering in April, leaving the stock just about 6per cent from its IPO price.</p>

      <p>Pinterest on average posted revenue of 90 cents per user globally in the third quarter, falling just short of analysts expectation of 91 cents, according to research firm FactSet.</p>
      <p>The company's net loss widened to US$124.7 million from US$18.9 million a year earlier, as total costs and expenses nearly doubled to US$413.4 million.</p>
      <p>Pinterest has been investing in areas such as advertiser diversification which would "bear fruit over the coming several quarters and years," Chief Financial Officer Todd Morgenfeld said on a post earnings call with analysts.</p>
      <p>"We're still in the early days of that, and it will unfold over a period of time."</p>
      <p>Pinterest, which calls its users "Pinners", said monthly active users jumped 28per cent to 322 million. Analysts had expected about 307 million users.</p>

      <p>Total revenue rose about 47per cent to US$279.7 million in the quarter ended Sept. 30, but fell short of analysts' estimates of US$280.6 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.</p>
      <p>The company generates revenue by placing advertisements among pins or posts, basically ideas for clothes, d√©cor and recipe, uploaded on the site by users.</p>
      <p>Excluding certain items, the company earned a cent per share. Analysts were expecting a loss of 4 cents.</p>
      <p>Pinterest expects 2019 total revenue to be between US$1.10 billion and US$1.115 billion, compared to its prior forecast of US$1.095 billion and US$1.115 billion. Analysts were expecting US$1.12 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.</p>
      <p>Pinterest was one of the most high-profile social media companies to list in the United States since Snap Inc in 2017.</p>
