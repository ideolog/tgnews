      <h1>‘Googler-only’ November OTA rolls out to some Pixel 3 devices</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T04:15:36+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 04:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5google.com/author/technacity/" target="_blank">Abner Li</a></address>
      <p>While the November security patch is officially expected on Monday, some <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/05/10/google-pixel-3a-review-video/">Pixel 3 XL</a> owners this afternoon have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/dpwv15/so_i_just_had_the_confidential_internal/">already</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/dpwi4w/anyone_else_receive_an_internal_google_ota_for/">received</a> the update. These devices have accidentally been included in a Googler-only internal OTA.</p>
      <p>From <a href="https://9to5google.com/2017/04/18/google-pixel-xl-ota-dogfood-test-build/">time-to-time,</a> there are reports of regular devices receiving updates intended for internal testing by Google employees. In 2016, this led to a Nexus 6P owner getting an <a href="https://9to5google.com/2016/07/29/nexus-6p-nougat-android-google/">internal build of Android 7.0 Nougat</a> before its official launch. The <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/06/19/googler-only-pixel-3a-ota/">last reported</a> occurrence was for the July 2019 patch on the Pixel 3a and brought the patch two weeks ahead of schedule.</p>
      <p>Today’s Googler-only Pixel 3 OTA is another minor incident and just applies a newer Android 10 build with the next security patch that is not due until November 4th.</p>
      <blockquote>CONFIDENTIAL INTERNAL ONLY — This is a confidential Googlers-only OTA to update your device to Android 9 with July 2019 security patches and critical bugfixes. You may use your device normally but do not discuss or comment on this update externally. Send feedback to android-dogfood-discuss@. See go/release-faqs for more info!</blockquote>
      <p>Following the <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/10/31/google-pixel-4-review/">Pixel 4</a>, this update should make third-party launchers compatible with the new gesture navigation system on all Android 10 Pixel devices. It will be the first update for Made by Google 2019 phones and address a slew of bug fixes. For example, a future update should let the <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/10/23/pixel-4-smooth-display-update/">90Hz Smooth Display</a> work in more lighting conditions. However, <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/10/20/pixel-4-face-unlock-eyes/">eye detection</a> for face unlock is not expected for several more months.</p>
      <p>The Googler-only Pixel 3 OTA looks to have rolled out this afternoon to a wider than usual swath of Pixel 3 XL devices. Many were alerted via system notification or realized they were updated after seeing next month’s security patch level.</p>
