      <p>The <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/united-states.html">United States</a>'s Department of the Interior has grounded its fleet of drones from <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/china.html">China</a> as it conducts a review of the programme.</p>
      <p>Nick Goodwin, an Interior Department spokesman, did not provide a reason for the decision on Thursday but the US has become increasingly concerned about security in relation to Chinese electronics.</p>
      <p>Goodwin said the review had been ordered by Interior Department Secretary David Bernhardt.</p>
      <p>"Until this review is completed, the secretary has directed that drones manufactured in China or made from Chinese components be grounded," he said.</p>

      <p>Exceptions would be made for drones that are being used for emergency purposes such as fighting wildfires, search and rescue, and dealing with natural disasters, Goodwin said.</p>
      <p>According to sources familiar with the programme, the Interior Department has a fleet of 810 drones, almost all built by Chinese companies.</p>
      <p>Only 24 are US-made and even those have Chinese electronic components, the sources said.</p>
      <p>The US Department of Homeland Security issued a warning in May that Chinese-made drones could pose a security risk.</p>
      <p>The US has also taken steps against <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/ajimpact/bans-federal-purchases-telecom-gear-huawei-190807171721265.html">China's Huawei</a> by effectively banning American companies from selling or transferring US technology to the Chinese telecoms giant.</p>
      <p>US intelligence believes Huawei is backed by the Chinese military and that its equipment could provide Beijing's spy agencies with a backdoor into the communications networks of other countries.</p>
      <p>Following the announcement, China's foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said on Thursday that it hoped Washington would "stop abusing the concept of national security" and provide a non-discriminatory atmosphere for Chinese companies.</p>
      <p>The Chinese company DJI produces about 70 percent of the world's commercial drones.</p>
      <p>"We're very disappointed," a DJI spokeswoman told AFP news agency, but declined to comment further.</p>
      <p>The Pentagon has banned the military from using DJI drones for security reasons since 2017.</p>
