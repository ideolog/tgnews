      <p>BRIDGEPORT, Calif. — Authorities say two women were killed while <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/great-outdoors">climbing </a>an icy canyon on <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/west/california">California</a>'s Red Slate Mountain.</p>
      <p>The Mono County Sheriff's Office says a helicopter crew spotted the bodies Monday at an elevation of about 12,000 feet. Because of high winds and steep terrain recovery efforts were delayed until the following day.</p>
