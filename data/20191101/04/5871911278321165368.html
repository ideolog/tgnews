      <h1>Ayesha Curry hints at Warriors tanking this season after Steph's injury</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T04:39:04+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 04:39</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thesportsdaily.com/author/tsd-staff/" target="_blank">TSD Staff</a></address>
      <p>The Warriors’ 2019-20 campaign took a turn for the worst on Wednesday night, when two-time MVP Stephen Curry suffered a broken left hand in the third quarter of the team’s game against the Suns.</p>
      <p>As if trailing 43-14 to a team the Warriors have historically dominated wasn’t bad enough, Curry breaking his hand driving to the basket in the second half of the game made matters even worse.</p>
      <p>It’s unclear when Steph will return to the lineup, as his injury could sideline him anywhere from a few weeks to a few months. The Warriors would be wise to have him sit as long as possible, to ensure he makes a full recovery — and, well, maybe to get a high draft pick. Even his wife, Ayesha, appeared to hint at that — notice her “Trust the process” reference.</p>

      <p>Both Splash Bros are currently sidelined, and the Warriors would indeed be wise to “Trust the process” and play for next season.</p>
