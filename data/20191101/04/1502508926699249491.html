      <p>Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) shares slipped as much as 4.42 per cent to Rs 140.30 apiece on the BSE on Friday after the company reported 83 per cent year-on-year (YoY) decline in profit before tax (PBT) at Rs 814.48 crore for the quarter ending September, owing to higher inventory losses and a decline in refinery margin. It had recorded Rs 4,805.74 crore PBT during the same period last year.</p>
      <p>The company’s net profit (profit after tax) came in at Rs 563.42 crore, as against Rs 3,246.93 crore during the same period in fiscal year 2018-19. “The decline in profit during the quarter was mainly on account of inventory loss against an inventory gain during the previous year,” said Sanjiv Singh, chairman of IOC, said at a press conference on Thursday. <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/ioc-profit-before-tax-falls-83-in-sep-quarter-on-higher-inventory-losses-119103101698_1.html"><b>CLICK TO READ FULL REPORT</b></a></p>
      <p>Revenue from operations declined by 12.7 per cent to Rs 1.32 trillion, as against Rs 1.51 trillion during the same time a year ago. Gross refining margin (GRM) was $1.28 a barrel during the quarter versus $6.79 a barrel a year ago. The GRM during the first half of year 2019-20 was $2.96 a barrel, as compared to $8.45 a barrel in the corresponding period of a year ago. Singh said one major reason for lower GRMs during the current fiscal was due to lower cracks.</p>
      <p>Further, the IOC chairman indicated that the company’s interests on the upcoming stake sale process by the government in Bharat Petroleum Corporation (BPCL) would depend on the offer by the government.</p>
      <p>During the past six months, IOC has seen 9 per cent growth in gasoline, 4.4 per cent in liquefied petroleum gas, and 1 per cent rise in diesel sales.</p>
      <p>At 10:13 am, the stock was trading nearly 3.50 per cent lower at Rs 142 apiece on the BSE as against 0.15 per cent rise in the S&amp;P BSE Sensex.</p>
