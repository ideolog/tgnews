      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T04:30:00+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Jane Barrie, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/jane-barrie/</a></address>
      <p>Scotland's favourite teatime snack has changed colour to raise awareness of the world’s toughest cancer.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/tunnocks-factory-veteran-insists-hes-19001054">Tunnock</a> ’s has produced a limited-edition batch of its famous teacakes wrapped in purple foil ahead of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/tunnocks-factory-veteran-insists-hes-19001054">Pancreatic Cancer</a> Awareness Month which begins today.</p>
      <p>The company made 1000 of the biscuits at its factory in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/tunnocks-factory-veteran-insists-hes-19001054">Uddingston</a>, Lanarkshire.</p>
      <p>Owner <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/tunnocks-factory-veteran-insists-hes-19001054">Sir Boyd Tunnock</a> said: “The colour purple symbolises the fight against pancreatic cancer and we were only too happy to ditch our distinctive red and silver branding to highlight such a good cause.”</p>
      <p>The biscuits will be donated to the Pancreatic Cancer Scotland (PCS) charity for fundraising.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Tunnock said: “Pancreatic Cancer Scotland is an organisation that’s close to our hearts at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/tunnocks-factory-veteran-insists-hes-19001054">Tunnock’s</a> .</p>
      <p>“We’ve had members of staff affected by pancreatic cancer and wanted to do all we could to help raise awareness.</p>
      <p>“But I don’t mind telling you we had a bit of bother sourcing exactly the right colour of foil for the biscuits. It was important to us that we got the correct shade of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/tunnocks-factory-veteran-insists-hes-19001054">purple</a> . Thankfully our suppliers were on the case and able to help.”</p>
      <p>Scottish landmarks will also be lit purple during the month.</p>
      <p>PCS development manager <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/tunnocks-factory-veteran-insists-hes-19001054">Fiona Brown</a> said: “Everyone loves Tunnock’s tea cakes – the branding is famous all over the world – and we’re honoured to have our very own limited edition biscuits.</p>
      <p>“All our fantastic supporters play a key role and embrace our belief that together we can make a difference.”</p>
      <p>About 800 people a year in Scotland are diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, which the lowest survival rate of all major cancers.</p>
