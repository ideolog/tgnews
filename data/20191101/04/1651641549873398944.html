      <p>Earlier this week, Apple <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/apple-officially-announces-airpods-pro-with-active-noise-cancellation-and-in-ear-design/">announced</a> the new AirPods Pro which came with a host of features like active noise cancellation and more. While AirPods have a bad <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/AirPods+Teardown/75578">reputation</a> in terms of repairability, we expected Apple to improve upon their design but that wasn’t the case.</p>
      <p>As <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/AirPods+Pro+Teardown/127551">iFixit found out</a>, Apple AirPods are just as unrepairable as their predecessors. They noted that the AirPods Pro are semi-modular but are glued in together making repairs really hard, if not impossible. All these issues resulted in AirPods Pro scoring a big fat 0 in terms of repairability. You can head below to read the highlights of the teardown and check out the official video posted by iFixit.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Instead of a proprietary battery stuffed deep into the stem, the Pros use semi-standard button cell batteries—a bit like those we found in the Galaxy Buds—although unfortunately soldered.</li>
        <li>Due to the tidier design, we got quite a lot farther with nondestructive disassembly this time—but eventually the ultrasonic cutter came out, and carnage ensued.</li>
        <li>We had to deform the case pretty heavily to wedge a spudger in there, but we managed to free the dual-cell Pro battery without too much trouble. At 1.98 Wh, it flexes solidly on the amateur AirPod 2’s single-cell 1.52 Wh case battery—as well as the 1.03 Wh Galaxy Buds case.</li>
        <li>While theoretically semi-serviceable, the non-modular, glued-together design and lack of replacement parts makes repair both impractical and uneconomical.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Apple is not the only company to get a zero in iFixit’s test. Last year <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/ifixit-awards-surface-laptop-2-0-points-may-god-have-mercy-on-its-soul/">Microsoft’ Surface Laptop 2 also scored zero</a> but Microsoft <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/ifixits-teardown-of-surface-laptop-3-shows-how-easy-it-is-to-replace-ssd-and-other-components/">improved upon the design and received 5 this year</a>. We do hope that Apple takes it in the right way and improves its AirPods design soon.</p>
