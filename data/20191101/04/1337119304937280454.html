      <p>Netflix’s adaptation of <i>The Witcher</i>, based on Andrzej Sapkowski’s adored novels, will be available to stream on December 20th, according to a new trailer.</p>
      <p>This is the second trailer for Netflix’s highly anticipated series, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/19/20698340/witcher-trailer-netflix-sdcc-comic-con-henry-cavill-roach">following a brief look at the show</a> this past summer at San Diego Comic-Con. It mostly highlights Geralt’s relationship with other characters in the show, but shows some new and intense action scenes.</p>
      <p>The series takes all of its inspiration from Sapkowski’s series instead of the incredibly <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/11/18659799/the-witcher-3-nintendo-switch-expansions-e3-2019">popular RPG series from CD Projekt Red</a>. Although Henry Cavill’s Geralt does show up in a bathtub, paying homage to a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/2/19/17028476/witcher-3-geralt-bath-tub-statue-dark-horse-toy-fair">moment in <i>The Witcher 3 </i>that spawned a popular meme</a>.</p>

      <p>Lauren Schmidt Hissrich, who is overseeing the series and is best known for her work on <i>The Umbrella Academy </i>and <i>The Defenders</i>, <a href="https://ew.com/comic-con/2019/07/18/the-witcher-showrunner-interview-netflix/?utm_campaign=entertainmentweekly_ew&amp;utm_content=link&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_term=1FCA08CA-A986-11E9-9D9C-A6FE4744363C">told <i>Entertainment Weekly</i></a><i> </i>in July that her show purposely strays away from the video games.</p>
      <p>“They went one direction, we actually get to go another,” Hissrich said. “We’re kind of holding close to our chest what we’re doing in the first season.”</p>
      <p>It’s not just video games and TV series that have found inspiration in <i>The Witcher</i>. There’s also a series of board games and even a trading card game. They all incorporate Sapkowski’s original stories to varying degrees.</p>
