      <p>Aside from the songs from Grande’s <i>Angels</i>-inspired album, the forthcoming spy movie will also feature a musical score by Brian Tyler (<i><a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/movie/reviews-various-artists-16045">Avengers: Age of Ultron</a>, Iron Man 3</i>). In an interview with <a href="https://collider.com/charlies-angels-soundtrack-details-new-theme-brian-tyler/"><i>Collider</i></a>, Tyler said he’d “composed new themes for the film that would feel nostalgic yet fresh”. That album will be released November 8 on Sony Music.</p>
      <p>The new <i>Angels</i> reboot is directed by Elizabeth Banks, and stars Kristen Stewart, Naomi Scott and Ella Balinska as its main heroines. The film will be released in the US on November 15 and in the UK on November 29.</p>
