      <h1>Companies' code of conduct not a rulebook but a playbook — MICG</h1>

      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 1): Malaysian Institute of Corporate Governance (MICG) deputy president David Berry said today the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission's (MACC) guidelines should be applied practically and proportionally to the size of companies and industries.</p>
      <p>Berry, who was speaking at the ACCCIM Seminar on Corporate Criminal Liability for Corruption here today, said anti-bribery and corruption (ABC) frameworks and codes of conduct should emulate those in larger entities, and then scaled down to the size and abilities of the company in question.</p>
      <p>He said a code of conduct is not a rulebook for a company, but a playbook instead, as it will influence behaviour within a company. "XYZ Sdn Bhd will not be held to the same standards as Petroliam Nasional Bhd [Petronas]," he said.</p>
      <p>Berry said companies have to address issues like employee loyalty, honesty, integrity and commitment to excellence in plain language, which can be understood by anyone in the organisation.</p>
      <p>He said codes of conduct should reflect the legal and regulatory environment wherever a company operates and ensure the highest standard is set.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, this should be written for everyone that deals for the company, including agents, according to him.</p>
      <p>Themes such as gift giving and entertaining, transparency in corporate reporting and disclosures besides encouragement of whistleblowing should be covered under the code of conduct, he said.</p>
