      <p>Nintendo’s Mario Kart for mobile phones, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/mario-kart-tour/40541"><i>Mario Kart Tour</i></a>, will get its first taste of real-time multiplayer this December. Nintendo will run a beta test before the end of the year, <a href="https://twitter.com/mariokarttourEN/status/1190074083100123137">the company said on Twitter</a>, but that multiplayer test will be restricted to players who subscribe to <i>Mario Kart Tour</i>’s Gold Pass.</p>
      <p><i>Mario Kart Tour</i>’s Gold Pass <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/9/25/20883283/mario-kart-tour-gold-pass-features-price">costs $4.99 per month</a> and grants subscribers access to the mobile karting game’s fastest speed class, 200cc, and other cosmetic rewards. Early access to multiplayer is another perk, and a way for Nintendo to keep the multiplayer pool limited for now.</p>
      <p>Nintendo <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2019/9/27/20887100/mario-kart-tour-review-nintendo-iphone-android">released <i>Mario Kart Tour</i> for Android and iOS devices in September</a>, but the mobile game shipped without a proper multiplayer mode, a staple of the franchise. Instead, players race against computer-controlled opponents in <i>Mario Kart Tour</i>’s stripped-down take on the 27-year-old franchise.</p>
      <p><i>Mario Kart Tour</i> is currently in the middle of a Halloween-themed event, which includes <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/10/21/20924780/waluigi-luigi-king-boo-mario-kart-tour">new racers Luigi, Waluigi, and King Boo</a>, as well as a witch costume for Rosalina, and new tracks, including Luigi’s Mansion.</p>
