      <p>A Privé outlet launched yesterday in the prominent corner space across from always-busy Tiong Bahru Market that was vacated by Tiong Bahru Social Club a few months ago.</p>
      <p>This location serves an extensive list of food all day long, from coffee to small bites to breakfast to heavy dinners and happy-hour drinks. </p>

      <p>At the branch, vegetarians and vegans can rejoice with the wide selection of plant-based dishes. So, don’t be shy to ask if your favorite items can be made vegan or vegetarian.</p>
      <p>Months ago, Privé Group <a href="https://coconuts.co/singapore/food-drink/food-buzz-tiong-bahru-club-relocating-to-little-india-prive-potentially-taking-over-former-space/">set its sights</a> on Tiong Bahru for its ninth branch. The other branches include the locations at Keppel Bay, Asian Civilisations Museum, Clarke Quay and Jewel Changi Airport.</p>
