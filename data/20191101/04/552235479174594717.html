      <h1>Man who admitted assaulting pregnant woman was approved as Labour candidate</h1>
      <h2>A party source said Alex Tiffin did not disclose the case when he put himself forward as a candidate.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T04:30:00+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Hutcheon, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/paul-hutcheon/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/indy2-support-rubbished-jeremy-corbyn-20761262">Scottish Labour</a> has been urged to overhaul its vetting processes after a former soldier who assaulted a pregnant woman <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/scots-muslim-who-sparked-terror-20563345">was approved as a potential candidate</a>.</p>
      <p>Alex Tiffin was given the green light to contest a Westminster selection - despite him being charged with a violent offence.</p>
      <p>A party source said Tiffin did not disclose the case when he put himself forward as a candidate.</p>
      <p>The Daily Record previously <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/scots-muslim-who-sparked-terror-20563345">revealed that Tiffin was attempting to become Labour’s candidate in Ross, Skye and Lochaber</a>, even though he had sparked a terror scare.</p>
      <p>The Scots Muslim found himself in court in 2017 after sending messages to a member of his mosque in the wake of the London Bridge attack.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Prosecutor Roderick Urquhart told Inverness Sheriff Court: “The first of these messages indicated that he was drunk, but the third said, ‘I decided to kill the unbelievables’, followed by a text stating ‘Unbelievers’ and another saying, ‘Allahu Akbar’.”</p>
      <p>However, Tiffin was admonished after a police investigation established no links to terror groups. “The conclusion has been that he was an idiot, not a terrorist,” Urquhart said.</p>
      <p>Tiffin said his offence was a result of mental illness and he passed Labour’s candidate vetting.</p>
      <p>In a separate case, Tiffin, who lives in the Highlands, admitted this week to assaulting a woman.</p>
      <p>His trial began by him denying a total of five charges, but after his victim gave evidence he admitted to one assault incorporating two incidents.</p>
      <p>Tiffin admitted seizing the woman in December 2014, pushing her on to a bed and covering her mouth with one hand and holding her neck with the other.</p>
      <p>He also pulled her off a couch, which caused her to fall to the floor in June 2017. Sentence was deferred until November 14.</p>
      <p>An insider said: “The party desperately needs to strengthen their vetting process to avoid any more embarrassing incidents like this.”</p>
      <p>Tiffin did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
