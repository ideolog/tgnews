      <p>South Korean singer-songwriter Wonho, a member of K-pop boyband <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/monsta-x">Monsta X</a>, has announced his departure from the group following allegations of financial mismanagement.</p>
      <p>The K-pop idol’s label Starship Entertainment broke the news yesterday (October 31) with a statement on Twitter, explaining that the singer’s exit was “amicable” and was reached “after a long discussion”. The company also added that it “greatly respect[s] Wonho’s decision”. Read the full statement below.</p>

      <p>Wonho’s exit comes hot on the heels of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4MsE92F0si/">accusations</a> made by former YG Entertainment trainee Han Seo-hee, who alleges he owes money to his former co-star on the South Korean variety show <i>Ulzzang Shidae</i>. Starship Entertainment has denied the allegations and, despite Wonho’s departure from the group, will “continue to hold legal liability for malicious claims related to this matter,” it wrote in a statement.</p>
      <p>Wonho – real name Shin Ho-seok – has issued an apology to his fans with a handwritten letter that explained his sudden exit from the group. The singer also urged fans to continue supporting his former group.</p>
      <p>“I carefully ask that you at least give support and encouragement to the members [of Monsta X]. They are people who are too good to stop and get hurt like this because of someone like me,” Shin wrote, as translated by <i><a href="https://www.soompi.com/article/1362750wpp/wonho-writes-letter-to-fans-following-departure-from-monsta-x">Soompi</a></i>. “I am so thankful and apologetic to the staff [of Starship Entertainment], members and lastly our fans who have allowed me to enjoy such happiness until this point.”</p>
      <p>Fans of Wonho have rallied around him on social media platforms, with tweets and posts in support of the singer. Fans have also started <a href="https://www.change.org/p/starship-keep-a-member-of-monsta-x?recruiter=1014944313&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=share_petition&amp;utm_term=Search%26gt%3BSAP%26gt%3BUS%26gt%3BNonBrand%26gt%3BBMM&amp;recruited_by_id=60edf8f0-fbbd-11e9-bf3e-dddb308e3a44">a petition which opposes his departure</a> from Monsta X. At the time of writing, the petition has garnered over 300,000 signatures.</p>
      <p>Starship Entertainment has also confirmed that Monsta X would continue as a six-piece band, with remaining members Shownu, Minhyuk, Kihyun, Hyungwon, Jooheon and IM.</p>
      <p>Prior to Wonho’s exit, Monsta X had been making waves in the West with a slew of English-language singles such as <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/monsta-x-channel-90s-boybands-music-video-someones-someone-2558033">‘Someone’s Someone’</a> and <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/monsta-x-join-forces-french-montana-new-single-who-do-u-love-2509095">‘Who Do U Love?’</a>. Back in February, they released their third studio album ‘Take.2 We Are Here’, which <i>NME</i>’s Rhian Daly called “focused and assured” in a <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/monsta-x-take-2-we-are-here-review">three-star review</a>.</p>
