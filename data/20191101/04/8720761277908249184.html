      <p>Microsoft has been slowly <a href="https://tech.slashdot.org/story/19/08/07/1355213/microsofts-msdn-magazine-is-ending-its-run-after-more-than-three-decades">dismantling its MSDN and TechNet blogging platforms</a> for the past year-plus. This week, Microsoft <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-is-replacing-msdn-and-technet-forums-with-microsoft-q-a/">introduced something meant to replace the MSDN and TechNet forums</a>: A <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/teamblog/introducing-microsoft-qanda">preview of Microsoft Q&amp;A</a>. From a report:<i> Microsoft officials said they are making the switch because its MSDN and TechNet forums are outdated, according to a Frequently Asked Questions page about the new Q&amp;A site. The new Q&amp;A experience is part of the larger docs.microsoft.com platform. It is designed to offer "relevant and timely answers to your technical problems from a community of experts and Microsoft engineers." The new service will allow users to follow posts, tags or people to get information; provide suggested answers as users type their questions; and the ability to bookmark content for future reference. Q&amp;A uses the same user authentication as Microsoft Docs and Learn. Experts will earn Reputation Points for answers they provide.</i></p>
