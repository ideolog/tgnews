        <b>How Nita Ambani became Mukesh Ambani’s wife</b>
      </p>
      <p>Unlike Mukesh Ambani, Nita hailed from a middle-class Gujarati family and was born as Nita Dalal. Her father Ravindrabhai Dalal worked as a senior executive of the Birla group. A graduate in Commerce from Narsee Monjee College of Commerce and Economics, Nita Ambani had started teaching when her destiny brought her in touch with Mukesh Ambani. A trained Bharatnatyam dancer that she was, her performance often took her around the country. It was during one of these performances when Mukesh Ambani’s late father Dhhirubhai Ambani developed a liking for her and decided to make her his elder daughter-in-law. She said yes to the proposal only on a condition that she will be allowed to continue with her teaching job.</p>
      <p>She, however, did not join her husband’s business straightaway. In an interview to Times of India, Nita Ambani had said, “For nearly 17 years, I was Mukesh’s wife but chose to stay away.” Driven by her passion to provide quality education in India, she was responsible for setting up of Dhirubhai Ambani International School in 2003. The school has become one of the most sought-after institutions for affluent parents in Mumbai.</p>

However, with the help of Dr Firuza Parikh, who is one of my closest friends, I first conceived my twins!</p>

        <b>When Nita Ambani refused tickets for World Cup match </b>
      </p>
