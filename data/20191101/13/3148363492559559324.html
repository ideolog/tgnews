      <p>The State Attorney General’s Office of Sonora announced the arrest of Yair Pérez López, aka “El Chicano,” a suspected cartel hitman wanted for a series of murders in Nuevo León. The capture was carried out by investigative personnel of the ministerial police (AMIC) in Hermosillo.</p>

      <p>The operation was carried out Monday at approximately 3pm. Pérez López was later handed over to Nuevo León authorities.</p>
      <p>Pérez López is expected to be charged with multiple counts of murder, kidnapping, and weapons violations related to his alleged activities in and around Monterrey between 2010 and 2011.</p>
      <p>One of his suspected high-profile crimes is the 2010 attack on a prison transport van. Gunmen kidnapped the jailed member of a kidnapping cell, Gabriela Elizabeth Muñiz Tamez La Pelirroja. Muñiz Tamez was abducted during transport to a medical clinic and her semi-nude body was later found <a href="https://vanguardia.com.mx/encuentranalapelirrojacolgadadeunpuenteennl-623293.html">hanging</a> from an overpass in colonia Mitras several days later, according to local reporting at the time. Muñiz Tamez was topless and had the name “Yair” marked on her back.</p>
      <p>Pérez López is accused of carrying out numerous attacks on municipal and state police, including the use of grenades and other explosive devices. Pérez López is also suspected in a series of prison personnel abductions from Topo Chico Prison. Federal Police <a href="https://www.excelsior.com.mx/node/712703">carried out</a> an arrest operation in 2011 but Pérez López was eventually released from custody, according to local reports.</p>
      <p>Authorities in Sonora indicated they did not know how long Pérez López was hiding in Hermosillo. The city is located 170 miles south of Arizona.</p>
