      <p>WEBSTER, Texas -- "This is awesome," one parent said. "This is what the community needs."<br/><br/>Buckets of pumpkins and Halloween bags overflowed with delicious candy, bringing smiles to the trick-or-treaters and senior citizens of Heartis Clear Lake, an assisted living facility in Houston, Texas.<br/><br/>"It's been great," resident Ortera Ellis said. "They come by and they have been really cute. It's fun for us."<br/><br/>The residents of Heartis asked for candy donations because they wanted to pass out treats to the children of their community.<br/><br/>Since the beginning of October, the candy kept rolling in. Word about Thursday's Halloween event spread fast.<br/><br/>"This thing has been filled about 14 times," Ellis said, referencing her candy basket.<br/><br/>Children and parents didn't hesitate to stop by.<br/><br/>"They are so sweet and so kind," another parent said. "Such a fun time for (my daughter) and for (the senior citizens), too."<br/><br/>It was a fun-filled Halloween for the children, and therapeutic for the residents who wanted to feel involved in their community this Halloween.<br/><br/>"It gives them a sense of reality," another parent said. "It gives them a sense they still have family and we are their family."<br/><br/>It's a memory made possible through the generosity of neighbors.</p>
