        <b>My husband and I have been together for nine years, </b>
        <b>and have two kids</b>
        <b>. He’s a good man: he cares about us, cooks for us and takes the kids to school. But I don’t feel sexually satisfied. I was his first girlfriend, although I had a few sexual partners before him. He is clumsy in bed, and often foreplay involves a lot of awkward elbows digging into me or fingers poking me uncomfortably. His lack of confidence is really unappealing. I also feel like a nag because I have to remind him to do anything around the house. I am struggling to feel I want to spend the rest of my life with him. Is there anything we can do to make our marriage better?</b>
