      <p>Iraq's top Shiite cleric Ali al-Sistani warned foreign actors on Friday against interfering in the country's anti-government protests as they entered their second month.<br/><br/>The demonstrations have evolved since October 1 from rage over corruption and unemployment to demands for a total government overhaul.<br/><br/>In his weekly sermon, Sistani said Iraq must not be dragged into the "abyss of infighting".<br/><br/>"No person or group, no side with a particular view, no regional or international actor may seize the will of the Iraqi people and impose its will on them," said Sistani's sermon, read by a representative.<br/><br/>Sistani's comments seemed to be directed at Iran's supreme leader Ali Khamenei.<br/><br/>"I seize this opportunity to tell those who care about Iraq and Lebanon to remedy insecurity as their priority," Khamenei said Thursday.<br/><br/>Ahmed al-Safi, delivering Sistani’s sermon Friday, said that Iraq’s Shiite religious establishment condemns "attacks on peaceful protesters and all forms of unjustified violence," and that those responsible should be held accountable. <br/><br/>More than 250 people have died and 10,000 have been wounded in the past month as protests evolved into calls for the "downfall of the regime".<br/><br/>On Thursday night, President Barham Saleh vowed to hold early elections once a new voting law and electoral commission has been agreed.<br/><br/>He also said Prime Minister Adel Abdel Mahdi was ready to step down once political leaders agree on a replacement.<br/><br/>Abdel Mahdi came to power a year ago .</p>
