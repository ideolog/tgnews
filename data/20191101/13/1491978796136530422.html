        <i>Residents say eighteen-month-old boy opened ‘faulty window’ in Tottenham tower block</i>
      </p>
      <p>A toddler has died after falling from a “faulty window” in a block of flats in north London.</p>
      <p>Police were called to Stellar House in High Road, Tottenham, at about 11am on Thursday and found the boy, aged about 18 months, in a critical condition.</p>
      <p>The London ambulance service, London fire brigade and air ambulance attended and the child was taken to a north London hospital but was pronounced dead shortly after arrival.</p>
      <p>Residents in the tower block said the boy had fallen after opening the window in the ninth-floor flat.</p>
      <p>A neighbour, Meral Dervik, said the toddler’s mother had been complaining to Haringey council about a faulty handle for two months but that nothing had been done. She said: “The window, it was faulty. Nearly two months, that was what [the mother] was saying. She was calling the council to come to fix it. The handle was not secure.”</p>
      <p>She added: “I had the same problems with the windows, even the glass is broken.”</p>
      <p>The toddler was said to have lived in the council flat close to the Tottenham Hotspur stadium with his mother, father and older sister.</p>
      <p>Dervik said of the boy’s mother: “She was looking after the kids brilliantly, she cared about the children.”</p>
      <p>Formal identification and a postmortem will take place in due course. The Metropolitan police are treating the death as unexplained and continuing their inquiries. A cordon remains in place at the scene and no arrests have been made.</p>
