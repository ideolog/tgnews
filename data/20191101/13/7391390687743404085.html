      <p>One of the most ancient forms of jewellery to still exist today bears the image of an anonymous woman. With the recent <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/best-evil-eye-jewellery-inspired-by-meghan-markles-bracelet-18841680">popularity surge of cameo jewellery</a>, her mystery has been brought to life once again.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.vogue.co.uk/fashion/article/cameo-jewellery-is-back-in-fashion">Worn by ancient emperors</a> and Victorian-era royalty alike, cameo necklaces, rings, brooches, and earrings had fallen into the "old-fashioned" realm. "They were <a href="https://www.vogue.co.uk/fashion/article/cameo-jewellery-is-back-in-fashion">seen to be the reserve of great aunts</a> and symbols of Victorian kitsch," Thomas Holman, director of antique jewellery dealer Wartski, told <i>Vogue</i>. But, he added, people are better understanding the "immense skill required to create them," leading to a newfound appreciation for the design.</p>
      <p>This revival has been no better exemplified than with Rihanna's latest Fenty drop. <a href="https://www.fenty.com/gb/en/releases/release-10-19/">With the silhouette of an African woman</a>, she is bringing something new and a much-needed sense of inclusivity to the vintage jewellery landscape. Her designs —<b> </b>which encompass a large-sized ring, earrings, and a necklace that can also be worn as a brooch —<b> </b>start at £280, but they're something to save up for.</p>
      <p>If, however, you want to try out the look but don't quite have those kinds of funds, there are a few cheaper options available. From Romanesque renditions to treasured antiques, these pieces will always have a home in your jewellery box.</p>
