      <p><a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/rage-against-the-machine-members-staying-silent-on-reunion-rumors/">As mentioned</a>, rumors of a <b>Rage Against The Machine</b> reunion began circulating after a new <a href="https://www.instagram.com/rageagainstthemachine/">Instagram account</a> with the band’s name (<s>but no blue verified check mark</s> <b>update: <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/rage-against-the-machines-instagram-now-verified/">the account is now verified</a></b>) posted a series of 2020 dates and venues, including both weekends of <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/coachella-2020-on-sale-friday/">Coachella</a>, with a picture of the recent Chilean protests. It’s the same picture that guitarist <b>Tom Morello</b> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4IoVibj6wZ/">reposted from a RATM fan account</a> last week. Since then, several sources have claimed to confirm the reunion.</p>
      <p>The first to comment (and to somehow find the new account) was the same fan account Tom reposted from, <a href="http://instagram.com/war_within_a_breath">@war_within_a_breath</a>, who — among other things — wrote, “along with other sources close to RATM, Juliette Lewis (who is dating Brad [Wilk]) confirmed to me the announcement is real.” (Juliette also liked the post on RATM’s instagram that announces the dates.)</p>
      <p>Next, an article on <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevebaltin/2019/11/01/confirmed-rage-against-the-machine-to-reunite-in-2020-headline-coachella/">Forbes</a> by music contributor Steve Baltin with “Confirmed” in the headline, reports that music manager and RATM associate Wayne Kamemoto said, “the band’s social media is accurate.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://consequenceofsound.net/2019/11/confirmed-rage-against-the-machine-reunite-2020/">Consequence of Sound</a> claims to have also confirmed the reunion via “industry sources” who “have confirmed to <i>Consequence of Sound</i> that the posting is accurate, and that the band is planning to play more shows beyond these initial dates.”</p>
      <p>Popular music festival themed Twitter account Festive Owl, is <a href="https://twitter.com/TheFestiveOwl/status/1190312427411378177?s=20">also independently saying that</a> “The band WILL be adding additional shows + festival dates specifically ahead of the 2020 US election.”</p>
      <p>Another popular RATM fan account on Twitter, <a href="https://twitter.com/RATM">@RATM</a>, which describes itself as “news from Tom, Tim, Brad &amp; Zack since 2010 with their blessing. Run by fans, not a label or agency. Also talk Prophets &amp; Audioslave. Blue tick not needed,” also just <a href="https://twitter.com/RATM/status/1190310485930979329">shared the reunion dates</a> without comment…. UPDATE: <a href="https://twitter.com/RATM/status/1190315614344273921">now they added</a> “Yes…it’s true…2020…”</p>
      <p>The band members’ social media accounts <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/rage-against-the-machine-members-staying-silent-on-reunion-rumors/">have been silent on the matter</a>, as has Coachella and the band’s official, verified account on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/RATM/">Facebook</a>. They’ve all had plenty of time to deny this by now, and nobody who said “confirmed” seems to be reversing their stance. Stay tuned for more updates.</p>
      <p><b>UPDATE:</b> B-Real and Chuck D of RATM offshoot Prophets of Rage have <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/b-real-chuck-d-issue-statements-on-prophets-of-rages-demise-following-ratm-reunion-news/">issued statements on Prophets of Rage’s demise</a>, following the news of the RATM reunion.</p>
      <p>Update, Tom Morello posted another <a href="https://twitter.com/tmorello/status/1190342911357071361">new tweet</a>, but it isn’t about RATM.</p>
