      <p>BANDA ACEH, Indonesia (Reuters) - An Indonesian man who worked for a clerical organization that advises a local government on Islamic law has been caned in public for adultery, an official said.</p>
      <p>Mukhlis bin Muhammad, 46, a member of the Aceh Ulema Council (MPU), was caned 28 times on Thursday in a public park by a religious officer, the official said.</p>
      <p>The woman he had the sexual relationship with was flogged, also in public, receiving 23 lashes.</p>
      <p>The punishments took place in ultra-conservative Aceh, the sole province in Indonesia - the world’s largest Muslim-majority nation - that applies sharia law. It was granted autonomy in 2001.</p>
      <p>Public floggings and canings - which many Acehnese support - have become common there since they were introduced in 2005, and are administered for a range of offences also including theft and gambling. The province outlawed homosexuality in 2014.</p>
      <p>MPU advised the Aceh government in drafting its current version of sharia. Muhammad’s role in the organization was not disclosed.</p>
      <p>Husaini Wahab, a senior official in Aceh Besar district, said canings were meant to serve as a reminder to locals to adhere to the Islamic criminal code.</p>
      <p>“It doesn’t matter whether he is an ulema, an imam, or an ordinary citizen, the government does not discriminate,” he said, adding that Muhammad could no longer belong to the MPU.</p>
      <p>Rights groups have called for public floggings and canings to be discontinued.</p>
      <p>Papang Hidayat, a researcher with Amnesty International, said they violated human rights. “Showing consensual affection should not be criminalized,” he said.</p>
      <p>Indonesia is home to a number of religious and ethnic minorities and has been seen as an example of how democracy and Islam can co-exist. But rising conservatism has in recent years spurred religious intolerance there.</p>
