      <p>Regice is the most useful of the Regis in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/pokemon-go/38713"><i>Pokémon Go</i></a>, but that isn’t saying much. It’s still a necessary part for those participating in the Colossal Discovery event, as well as those who are just trying to complete their Pokédex.</p>
      <p>Regice is weak against fire-, rock-, fighting- and steel-type moves, so there are quite a few counters you can use against this thing. Check out some of the following below:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Moltres </b>with Fire Spin and Overheat/Flamethrower</li>
        <li><b>Entei </b>with Fire Spin/Fire Fang and Overheat</li>
        <li><b>Machamp </b>with Counter/Karate Chop and Dynamic Punch</li>
        <li><b>Charizard </b>with Fire Spin and Blast Burn</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This pretty much uses the same counters as Registeel, but just take some fire- and fighting-types and it’ll be over quick. Stay away from flying-, grass-, ground-, and dragon-types for this fight.</p>
      <p>Lucky players may encounter a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/shiny/39323">Shiny</a> Regice. Do note that if you do see a Shiny, it will catch on the first ball you hit it with, so use a Pinap Berry to score some extra candy.</p>

      <p>Once you nab your Regice, give it Frost Breath and Blizzard for it make the most of its ice-typing, but do note that Regice is not that great of an attacker.</p>
      <p>Regirock will leave raids with its siblings on Nov. 4 at 4 p.m. ET.</p>
