      <h1>Liverpool's James Milner explains how he could have signed for rivals Everton</h1>
      <h2>The veteran midfielder is a hero at Anfield but almost ended up plying his trade across Stanley Park</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T13:40:47+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 13:40</time> by <a rel="author">Darren Wells, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/darren-wells/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/james-milner">James Milner</a> has revealed how he could have ended up signing for Everton long before his Champions League exploits with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> .</p>
      <p>The 33-year-old midfielder has become a hero at Anfield after helping the team to the European Cup in June.</p>
      <p>However he could have been plying his trade across Stanley Park had it not been for a bout of bad weather.</p>
      <p>Milner started his career with boyhood club Leeds, before playing for several top flight clubs prior to his switch to Liverpool.</p>
      <p>Yet it was in fact <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a> who first came calling for his talents, offering Milner a trial after he impressed club scouts, but a twist of fate ensured it was never fulfilled.</p>

      <p>Speaking in his autobiography, Milner said: "The first club that showed an interest was Everton.</p>
      <p>“I might even have ended up signing for them if my trial hadn’t been called off because of snow.</p>
      <p>“I had carried on playing for Westbrook Juniors and I ended up moving up to the Under-12s because they didn’t have an Under-10 or Under-11 team.</p>

      <p>“I scored a lot of goals and I must have been doing okay because when it came to the end of that season, there were parents from some of the other teams complaining I shouldn’t be allowed to play against them because I was ‘too young’.</p>
      <p>“I played a district match in Crosby and I was told afterwards an Everton scout had been watching and wanted me to go on trial.</p>
      <p>“That was the first time I had even thought about the possibility of being a footballer, but then the trial game got called off because of snow.</p>

      <p>“We kept waiting for another phone call, but it never came, so I thought my chance might have come and gone.”</p>
      <p>Milner ended up signing on with Leeds academy at the age of 10, before later becoming the youngest-ever Premier League debutant just a few months shy of his 17th birthday.</p>
      <p>And the rest, as they say, is history.</p>
