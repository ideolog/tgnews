        <i>Preah Sihanouk governor says autopsy has determined cause of British backpacker’s death</i>
      </p>
      <p>An autopsy has determined the British backpacker Amelia Bambridge, whose body was found at sea a week after she disappeared, died from drowning, a Cambodian official has said.</p>
      <p>The governor of Preah Sihanouk province said her body was examined at the main hospital in Sihanoukville, where it was taken after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/31/amelia-bambridge-found-dead-sea-cambodia">being found</a> on Thursday in the Gulf of Thailand.</p>
      <p>Bambridge, 21, disappeared after attending a beach party on the night of 23 October on the island of Koh Rong. Her body was discovered by fishermen about 60 miles (97km) away.</p>
      <p>The provincial police chief had earlier said the autopsy would be attended by forensic police, a hospital doctor, a court prosecutor, a representative of the British embassy and members of Bambridge’s family.</p>
