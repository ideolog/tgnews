      <p>MOTT HAVEN, Bronx (WABC) -- A woman was brutally attacked in the Bronx with a metal pipe and police say it's not the first time the suspect hurt someone.</p>
      <p>The woman was walking near Walton Avenue and East 144th Street in the Mott Haven section at around 3 p.m. when the man approached her from behind.</p>
      <p>He then hit her with a metal pipe. She suffered a broken arm and was taken to the hospital.</p>
      <p>The week prior, police say that around 1:30 p.m. near Willis Avenue and East 144th Street, he approached a 13-year-old boy.</p>
      <p>He apparently put his hands over the victim's eyes and slammed him to the ground.</p>
      <p>The boy suffered minor injuries.</p>
      <p>The person wanted by police is only described as a Hispanic man in his 30s.</p>
      <p>Anyone with information in regard to this incident is asked to call the NYPD's Crime Stoppers Hotline at 1-800-577-TIPS (8477) or for Spanish, 1-888-57-PISTA (74782).</p>
