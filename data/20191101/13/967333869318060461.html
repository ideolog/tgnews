      <p>India is set to carry out its first-ever military exercise with Uzbekistan to strengthen military diplomacy in the Eurasian region. A 45-member contingent is taking part in a joint military exercise named DUSTLIK-2019 that will primarily focus on anti-terror operations.</p>
      <p>During the 10-day military exercise, beginning 4 November, the troops will train in heliborne operations, mountain craft, tactical operations and house-intervention drills.</p>
      <p>Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and his Uzbeki counterpart Bakhodir Nizamovich Kurbanov will witness the curtain-raiser event of the joint exercise on 3 November. The two countries will discuss defence cooperation in detail, in a separate bilateral meet between the two countries.</p>
      <p>On Friday morning, Rajnath Singh arrived in Tashkent to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meeting and also to attend bilateral engagements with Uzbekistan.</p>
      <blockquote>“I Look forward to meeting Uzbekistan’s Defence Minister, Major Gen. K. Nizamovich to discuss issues pertaining to defence cooperation,” the minister stated ahead of departing for the country.</blockquote>
      <p>Last year, the two countries agreed to hold joint military training exercises in the field of <a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201910311077189277-pakistan-violated-vienna-convention-intl-court-of-justice-tells-un-assembly/">counter-terrorism</a> and to cooperate in military education and army medicine. It was also decided to set up a Joint Working Group to support and sustain enhanced defence-related activities and defence wings at their respective embassies in Tashkent and New Delhi.</p>

      <p>Singh will represent India at the <a href="https://sputniknews.com/military/201909031076709482-belarusian-president-offers-to-launch-joint-anti-terror-effort-of-un-eu-csto-cis-sco/">Shanghai Cooperation Organization’s</a> (SCO) Council of the Heads of Government (CHG) meeting on 1-2 November. The SCO represents over 40% of the population and nearly 20% of the global GDP.</p>
      <blockquote>“I look forward to further India’s association with SCO members which will help us in greater economic cooperation and also counter-terrorism cooperation, among several other things,” the minister added.</blockquote>
      <p>The last two CHG meetings were held in 2017 in the Russian city of Sochi and in 2018 in Tajikistan’s largest city and capital Dushanbe.</p>
