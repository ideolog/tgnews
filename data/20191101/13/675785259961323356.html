      <h1>Trent Alexander-Arnold explains why toughest game of his career was against Man Utd</h1>
      <h2>Trent Alexander-Arnold has faced many world class strikers but Marcus Rashford was the hardest to deal with</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T13:46:22+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 13:46</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Polden, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/jake-polden/</a></address>
      <p>Trent Alexander-Arnold has named Marcus Rashford his hardest opponent, saying he underestimated the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> forward.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> right-back is widely considered to be one of the best defenders in the world, and has demonstrated his class on a world stage, notably against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> .</p>
      <p>Manchester United away is the biggest game of Liverpool's domestic season, and in March 2018 Alexander-Arnold made up a Reds back four at Old Trafford.</p>
      <p>But the defender quickly found himself up against it, with Rashford netting twice and getting the better of the young England international.</p>
      <p>Looking back on the fixture, which United won 2-1, Alexander-Arnold has labelled his exchange with Rashford his toughest to date.</p>

      <p>Alexander-Arnold told <a href="https://theathletic.com/1327966/2019/11/01/trent-alexander-arnold-exclusive/">The Athletic:</a> "Yeah, the toughest in terms of a direct opponent and someone getting on top of me in professional football.</p>
      <p>"I'd say I underestimated him. It was a massive learning curve for me.</p>

      <p>"It was something that I hated happening.</p>
      <p>"As a Liverpool player it's probably the worst game of the season to perform like that. But when things like that happen you have to learn from them."</p>
