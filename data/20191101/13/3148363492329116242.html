      <p>By moving to Palm Beach, Florida, the Trumps will escape the combined New York State and New York City income tax of 12.7 percent. Their assets will also be free of a 16 percent New York estate tax on assets more than $5.75 million, according to <i><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ashleaebeling/2019/10/31/president-trump-thumbs-nose-at-new-york-tax-collector-with-move-to-florida/#7b8df75426d0">Forbes</a></i>.</p>
      <p>The president and first lady will remain in the White House as long as Trump is president.</p>
      <p>“I cherish New York, and the people of New York, and always will,” Trump said, pointing out he was badly mistreated by state and local officials despite paying millions in taxes every year.</p>
      <p>“Few have been treated worse,” he <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1190079192358105088">continued</a>. “I hated having to make this decision, but in the end it will be best for all concerned.”</p>
      <p>Trump was born and raised in New York City, where he made a name for himself as a developer and a celebrity.</p>
      <p>“As President, I will always be there to help New York and the great people of New York,” Trump said. “It will always have a special place in my heart!” he <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1190079193582899200">added</a>:</p>
