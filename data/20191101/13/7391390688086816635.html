      <p>Fans have been crushing on R. Patz ever since he played heart-throb vampire Edward Cullen in the first <i>Twilight </i>film (which, by the way, was <i>eleven years ago). </i>His new 'do in <i>The King</i> recently sent people into a thirst-frenzy yet again, causing some to wonder <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/robert-pattinsons-appearance-in-the-king-has-caused-understandable-meltdown-on-twitter-18706008">who Robert Pattinson is dating in 2019</a>. Well, he's incredibly private about his love life — so private, in fact, that he's reportedly been dating someone for a little more than a year now, but the last time they were photographed together was this summer.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/956049/robert-pattinson-and-suki-waterhouse-spark-romance-rumors-after-pda-filled-date-night">Pattinson was first linked to British model Suki Waterhouse</a> back in July 2018 after E! News snapped them on a date in London. A source told the outlet the pair caught <i><i>Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again</i> </i>at a local theater, then headed to SoHo House for a few drinks. At the end of the night, they reportedly started packing on the PDA while walking home, with an onlooker telling E! they looked "very loved up and close."</p>
      <p>Then in August, a source for <i>Us Weekly</i> claimed that <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/robert-pattinson-suki-waterhouse-have-been-dating-for-months/">Pattinson and Waterhouse had actually "been dating</a> for months" and knew each other for quite some time before things took a romantic turn. Later that month, the <i>Daily Mail </i><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-6098577/Suki-Waterhouse-splits-Twilight-hunk-Robert-Pattinson.html">reported the pair had split</a>, which definitely didn't appear to be the case come October when they were <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a24476139/robert-pattinson-suki-waterhouse-nightclub-date-breakup-rumor/">photographed leaving Chiltern Firehouse together</a> at 2:15 a.m., according to <i>Elle.</i></p>

      <p>Photos of the couple would be few and far between in the months that followed, but every occasional sighting — like when they <a href="https://www.laineygossip.com/robert-pattinson-suki-waterhouses-relationship-update-on-her-birthday-london/51721">celebrated Waterhouse's 27th birthday</a> in January 2019, or when they <a href="https://people.com/movies/robert-pattinson-suki-waterhouse-hold-hands-london/">held hands after a run</a> a few weeks later — suggested they were still together. At that point, neither of the stars had publicly discussed their relationship, but Pattinson finally opened up (kind of) during an interview with <i>The Sunday Times </i>in April. When asked about Waterhouse, the star was hesitant to share any details. He did, however, explain why he <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/magazine/style/robert-pattinson-interview-the-high-life-star-talks-dating-and-privacy-in-hollywood-pqwvqq9h5?wgu=270525_54264_15719436127096_3372b4bb45&amp;wgexpiry=1579719612&amp;utm_source=planit&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_content=22278">doesn't like talking about his personal life</a>. "If you let people in, it devalues what love is," Pattinson told the <i>Times. "</i>If you put up a wall it ends up better."</p>
      <p>Both he and Waterhouse dated other well-known celebrities in the past, so Pattinson's position on maintaining privacy clearly comes from experience. The <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/robert-pattinson-kristen-stewart-were-spotted-together-basically-its-2008-again-9295973">actor and his <i>Twilight</i> costar, Kristen Stewart, dated</a> for more than three years before breaking up for good in 2013. In 2014, <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/why-did-robert-pattinson-fka-twigs-break-up-it-seems-like-it-may-have-been-a-long-time-coming-2930816">he started seeing singer FKA Twigs</a>. The couple got engaged the following year, but announced their split in October 2017.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.bustle.com/articles/71024-suki-waterhouse-bradley-cooper-reportedly-split-up-for-a-very-good-reason">Waterhouse was linked to Bradley Cooper</a> from 2013-2015, then spent the next year casually dating a handful of <a href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com.au/celebrity/suki-waterhouse-dating-history-17073">actors, like Nat Wolff and Richard Madden</a> after their breakup, according to <i>Harper's Bazaar Australia. </i>She was also in a <a href="https://people.com/movies/darren-aronofsky-and-suki-waterhouse-spotted-taking-a-stroll-together-at-sundance/">relationship with Diego Luna</a> from 2016-2017, although it's unclear when exactly they split.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1064973/robert-pattinson-and-suki-waterhouse-prove-they-re-still-going-strong-on-rare-outing">Pattinson and Waterhouse were last photographed together</a> this past August, according to E! News. Their lack of public pics doesn't mean they've parted ways, though. A source told E! that the couple makes "time for each other in between their work requirements" and prefers to hang out on the down-low in London.</p>
