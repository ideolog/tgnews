      <h1>Why are teenagers on TikTok obsessed with an eerie 1950s song?</h1>

        <i>The video-sharing platform beloved by Gen Z is giving new life to some very old tunes – from YMCA to a twee number by a mid-century sister act</i>
      </p>
      <p>Mention of the video-sharing platform <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jul/05/why-tiktok-is-facing-greater-scrutiny-video-sharing-app-child-safety">TikTok</a> brings to mind two things: a) the endless torrent of spellbindingly inane 15-second clips created by its gargantuan teen userbase, and b) its ironclad ability to make anyone born before the turn of the millennium feel like a bewildered OAP. Yet since the app’s global launch in 2018, TikTok has carved out another reputation: as a musical tastemaker. Forget Spotify algorithms or, shudder, the mass media, nowadays young people are discovering their new favourite tunes layered under bedroom makeup tutorials or films of body-popping GCSE students.</p>
      <p>That means TikTok can make unknown tracks go stratospheric; Old Town Road, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jul/29/lil-nas-xs-old-town-road-sets-new-record-for-most-weeks-at-no-1">Lil Nas X’</a>s country-rap smash, owes its success to a cleverly engineered TikTok challenge. Yet the app also uses its hit-making powers to give random songs a second life: decade-old singles, such as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/04/mariah-carey-bossiness-breakups-bipolar-interview">Mariah Carey</a>’s Obsessed and Jay Sean’s Ride It, have both enjoyed massive popularity spikes thanks to tie-in TikTok dance challenges.</p>

      <p>But they are far from the strangest songs to have been resurrected. Take, for example, Spooky Scary Skeletons, a 1996 Halloween children’s song by Golden Girls theme writer Andrew Gold. A remix of this novelty number currently soundtracks 2.6m <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/tiktok">TikTok</a> videos thanks to, you guessed it, a viral dance challenge. Or even odder, the popularity of Tonight You Belong to Me, an eerily twee unrequited-love song made famous by sister act Patience and Prudence in 1956. Hearing its unusually quaint melody reappropriated as a teen anthem is extremely discombobulating; on the app you can watch a gaggle of excitable friends bellowing the haunting top line while swaggering through a shopping centre.</p>
      <p>To the casual observer, it may seem as if these old songs have been plucked from the internet’s infinite music catalogue by the modern future-humans of Gen Z, who have identified some exciting and mysterious lure <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/25/teen-girls-on-tiktok-are-dancing-to-abuse-the-new-meme-is-as-old-as-womens-rage-itself">inaudible to anyone over the age of 21</a>. The truth is far less strange: TikTok is simply echoing existing success stories. Spooky Scary Skeletons was already a massive hit on YouTube, thanks to a 2010 video that paired it with a vintage Disney animation, while Tonight You Belong to Me has been repeatedly covered by artists and often crops up on TV.</p>
      <p>In fact, TikTok’s penchant for excavating vintage tunes can be rather comforting: recently, the app found itself in the grip of YMCA mania, thanks to a challenge involving the school disco standard and face-tracker software. The global, never-ending talent show that is TikTok teenagerdom might seem horrifyingly newfangled, but it feels like a relief to know this tomorrow’s world can’t quite leave the past behind.</p>
