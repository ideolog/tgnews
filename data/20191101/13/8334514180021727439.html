      <p>OSLO (Reuters) - German auto maker Audi’s fully-electric e-tron sports utility vehicle was the top-selling car in Norway last month with an 8.3% market share, registration data showed on Friday.</p>
      <p>Audi delivered 873 electric SUVs in October, ahead of Volkswagen Golf (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/VOWG_p.DE">VOWG_p.DE</a>) in second place with 748 cars, according to the Norwegian Road Federation.</p>
      <p>In total, 35.7% of all cars sold in Norway last month were electric.</p>
      <p>Seeking to end the sale of combusion-engine cars by the middle of the next decade, Norway exempts battery-powered vehicles from taxes imposed on petrol and diesel engines.</p>
      <p>Tesla’s Model 3 sales fell to a market share of just 1.2% in October, but the car still remains the country’s top-selling car year-to-date.</p>
