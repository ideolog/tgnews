        <b>An 83-year-old woman and her 72-year-old partner have died in the city of Périgeux, southwestern France, in a case which local police are treating as suspected femicide, followed by suicide.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The alarm was raised on Thursday evening by a nurse who arrived at the couple's home for <a href="http://en.rfi.fr/france/20190919-woman-murdered-partner-northern-france-femicide-rate-climbs">a regular visit to the ailing woman</a>. The nurse notified the police that she was unable to gain entry to the apartment, and that there appeared to be a fire burning out of control inside.</p>
      <p>The fire services discovered the dead body of the woman, with gunshot wounds to the neck. Faced with a man armed with a rifle, the fireman called in <a href="http://le.raid.free.fr/">the anti-terrorist RAID police unit</a>.</p>
      <p>The building was evacuated before the police commando fired stun grenades in an effort to dislodge the man who had barricaded himself in the apartment.</p>

      <p>During the police assault, the man apparently turned his weapon on himself.</p>
      <p>A judicial enquiry has been begun. The reasons for the tragic events have yet to be explained.</p>
      <p>According to neighbours <a href="http://www.francebleu.fr/perigord">interviewed by French radio</a>, the woman had been suffering from depression in the wake of the suicide of her son. Her partner had several times indicated that he was fed up with the situation.</p>
