        <i>The trick is that they needn’t be fancy – a simple pair will often look best</i>
      </p>
      <p>Trousers in the evening is such a good look. Think of that 1975 Helmut Newton shot of an Yves Saint Laurent Le Smoking in a backlit Paris street. The woman is wearing a tuxedo and tailored trousers with a buttoned-up white shirt, and she’s as sexy as any of his nudes, to my mind. If I walk into a cocktail party and among all the women in dresses there’s one in trousers, she’s the one I want to meet.</p>
      <p>Tricky, though, I find. I love trousers-for-evening in theory, but in reality (on me) not so much. But do you know what? I think I’ve finally realised where I’ve been going wrong. Here’s the thing: the concept of trousers as eveningwear suggests the trousers should be in some way fancy, but trousers that look nice on real women tend to be quite the opposite. A gold leather paperbag-waist pair look great on Gigi Hadid. Ditto high-waisted latex leggings. Ditto jewel-coloured palazzo pants. Which is great, fine, good for her. But when I try on any that are elaborate – even a bright colour, or an embellished waistband – I look in the mirror and, it’s not necessarily that I hate how it looks, just that I feel a bit self-conscious, and suddenly a dress seems as if it might be the answer after all.</p>
      <p>The trousers that look nice on most of us are simple trousers. You know that already. What are your favourite trousers? Maybe an old pair of jeans. Maybe a hardworking black pair you have on constant standby. Maybe a great pair of tracksuit trousers. Who would name a gold leather pair as their desert-island trousers? Nobody, that’s who. Except maybe Gigi. So it makes sense that your trousers-for-evening should be simple, too.</p>
      <p>The ones I’m wearing here are an old favourite pair from Whistles; I haven’t worn them in the evening because I think of them as work trousers. But, look! Add a camisole and a pair of heels, and this is a passably dressed-up outfit – in a pair of trousers I really like and therefore feel relaxed and happy in.</p>
      <p>Admittedly, this combination lacks the drama and verve of Le Smoking. But evening trousersuits just don’t work on me. I feel as if I’m wearing an unfamiliar uniform, for a job in which I haven’t passed the probationary period. Trousers for evening can be tricky territory. But you won’t go wrong if you keep it simple.</p>
