      <h1>Five asteroids will skim past Earth today - including one the size of Great Pyramid of Giza</h1>
      <h2>NASA estimates that the largest of the five, dubbed 2019 UD13, measures between 54 metres and 120 metres in diameter</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T13:08:51+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 13:08</time> by <a rel="author">Shivali Best, https://www.facebook.com/shivalibestjournalist/</a></address>
      <p>Five <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/asteroids">asteroids</a> are set to skim past our planet this evening, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/nasa">NASA</a> has revealed.</p>
      <p>The space rocks will pass Earth in quick succession, with the first passing taking place at 18:48 GMT, and the fifth at 20:45 GMT.</p>
      <p>NASA estimates that the largest of the five, dubbed 2019 UD13, measures between 54 metres and 120 metres in diameter.</p>
      <p>At the higher end of that estimate, it suggests that the asteroid could be almost as big as the Great Pyramid of Giza!</p>
      <p>As well as being the biggest of the five, 2919 UD13 will also be travelling the quickest during its passing, zooming past Earth at a whopping 51,874 miles/hour.</p>
      <p>Thankfully, the asteroids will pass Earth at a safe distance, meaning it’s extremely unlikely one will hit us.</p>

      <p>The closest of the five, dubbed 2019 UP7, will be 3.6 million miles from Earth when it passes. While this mights sound far, it's classed by NASA as a 'close' passing.</p>
      <p>NASA discovers around 30 new ‘near-Earth objects’ (NEOs) every week, and at the start of 2019 had discovered a total of more than 19,000 objects.</p>
      <p>However, the space agency has warned its NEO catalogue isn’t complete, meaning an unpredicted impact could occur at ‘any time.’</p>
      <p>NASA and European Space Agency team up to stop killer asteroids hitting Earth Asteroids</p>
      <p>NASA explained: “Experts estimate that an impact of an object the size of the one that exploded over Chelyabinsk, Russia, in 2013 – approximately 55 feet (17 meters) in size – takes place once or twice a century.</p>
      <p>“Impacts of larger objects are expected to be far less frequent (on the scale of centuries to millennia).</p>
      <p>“However, given the current incompleteness of the NEO catalogue, an unpredicted impact – such as the Chelyabinsk event – could occur at any time.”</p>
