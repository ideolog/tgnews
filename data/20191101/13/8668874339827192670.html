      <h1>Another Premiership player allowed to skip a match to watch a brother in the RWC final</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T13:11:19+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 13:11</time> by <a rel="author">Josh Raisey</a></address>
      <p>Marcus Watson has flown out to <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/japan">Japan</a> to watch his brother Anthony play for <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/england">England</a> in the World Cup final on Saturday against <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/south-africa">South Africa</a> after another successful social media campaign.</p>
      <p>Following on from the success of the #GetBenToJapan campaign for <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/news/ben-curry-responds-after-social-media-campaign-gets-him-to-japan-to-watch-england-twin-tom/">Sale Sharks’ </a><a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/sale/players/ben-curry/">Ben Curry</a> to go and watch his twin Tom, another hashtag #WatsonToWorldCup built momentum for Wasps’ Watson and he will now also be in Yokohama.</p>
      <p>The Olympic sevens silver medalist took to Twitter to thank both <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/wasps">Wasps</a> and Dai Young for letting him go as it will mean he will miss his club’s <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership">Gallagher Premiership</a> visit from <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/bath">Bath</a> on Saturday.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Ben Youngs’ brother, former England international Tom, ruled out the possibility of going to Japan, claiming on Twitter that he “has a job to do this weekend here in Leicester”.</p>
      <p>The Tigers sit at the bottom of the Premiership following two defeats. They host <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/gloucester">Gloucester</a> on Saturday and their captain will be playing. He sent this message on social media.</p>

      <p>Anthony Watson s starting on the wing against the Springboks, while World Rugby player of the year nominee <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/sale/players/tom-curry/">Tom Curry</a> will be starting at blindside flanker.</p>
      <p>With Eddie Jones’ side entering the match as favourites, this was surely an opportunity that the likes of <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/wasps/players/marcus-watson/">Marcus Watson</a> and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership-cup/teams/sale/players/ben-curry/">Ben Curry</a> could not turn down. Wasps and Sale – to their credit – seem to have understood that.</p>
