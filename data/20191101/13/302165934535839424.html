      <p>WASHINGTON, Nov 1 — “READ THE TRANSCRIPT!” US President Donald Trump exhorts regularly on Twitter, referring to a telephone call with Ukraine’s president that led to an impeachment inquiry. Now he is threatening to do just that — on live television.</p>
      <p>Trump told the <i>Washington Examiner</i> he would not cooperate with congressional impeachment proceedings and might read out loud a transcript of a July 25 call in which Trump asks President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate a domestic political rival.</p>
      <p>“This is over a phone call that is a good call,” Trump told the <i>Examiner</i> in an interview. “At some point, I’m going to sit down, perhaps as a fireside chat on live television, and I will read the transcript of the call, because people have to hear it. When you read it, it’s a straight call.”</p>
      <p>Trump’s reference to the fireside chat recalled the informal evening radio addresses President Franklin D. Roosevelt used to reassure Americans facing hardships during the Great Depression — a far cry from a US president defending himself against impeachment.</p>
      <p>The Trump administration in September released a detailed summary of the 30-minute call — not a precise transcript — based on notes taken by aides, as Democrats in the House of Representatives began looking into Trump’s call following a whistleblower complaint.</p>
      <p>The House, which is controlled by Democrats, approved rules yesterday for the next, more public, stage in the inquiry into the Republican president’s attempt to have Ukraine investigate a domestic political rival.</p>
      <p>The inquiry centres on whether Trump solicited foreign interference and aid in a US election, which federal law prohibits. Democrats are also investigating whether Trump withheld US$391 million (RM1.6 billion) in American aid to vulnerable Ukraine, who faced a military threat from Russian-backed separatists, as leverage to get Zelenskiy to announce an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter.</p>
      <p>Biden is a leading contender for the Democratic nomination to face Trump in the November 2020 presidential election. Hunter Biden sat on the board of a Ukrainian energy company. There has been no evidence of wrongdoing on their part.</p>
      <p>Current and former Trump administration officials have testified behind closed doors that the White House went outside normal diplomatic channels to pressure Zelenskiy to investigate the Bidens.</p>
      <p>Trump has insisted he did nothing wrong. He said his administration would continue to not honour document requests and subpoenas.</p>
      <p>He told the <i>Examiner</i> he would fight back with a defence of the Ukraine call and use his well-honed art of the slogan, offering T-shirts emblazoned with “Read the transcript.” — Reuters</p>
