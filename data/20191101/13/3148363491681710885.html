      <h1>Donald Trump on Impeachment: Clinton Was Guilty, 'I Did Nothing Wrong'</h1>
      <h2>President Donald Trump dismissed Thursday the idea he deserved impeachment, claiming he did not commit an impeachable offense unlike former presidents Bill Clinton and Richard Nixon.</h2>

      <p>“Everybody knows I did nothing wrong. Bill Clinton did things wrong; Richard Nixon did things wrong. I won’t go back to [Andrew] Johnson because that was a little before my time,” Trump said. “But they did things wrong. I did nothing wrong.”</p>
      <p>The president made his remarks in an <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/fireside-chat-on-live-television-trump-says-he-wants-to-read-transcript-of-ukraine-call-to-american-people">interview </a>with the <i>Washington Examiner</i> on Thursday.</p>
      <p>“Clinton was different. He was guilty,” Trump said. “This is a simpler case than his.”</p>
      <p>Democrats believe Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine in order to pressure leaders to investigate Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden, which was an impeachable defense.</p>
      <p>But Trump said he had an obligation to examine corruption in Ukraine before giving them financial and military aid.</p>
      <p>“We are giving them money, we are giving them weapons,” he said. “We have an obligation to look at corruption.”</p>
      <p>Trump suggested that Democrats were overstepping their authority and were out of line with the public mood.</p>
      <p>“I did nothing wrong, and for them to do this is a disgrace,” he said. “To me the word impeachment’s a very ugly word.”</p>
      <p>Trump said that impeachment would only rally his political base.</p>
      <p>“It’s energized my base like I’ve never seen before,” he said.</p>
