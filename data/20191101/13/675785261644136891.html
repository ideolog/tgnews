      <h2>The Arsenal captain clashed with the fans during the 2-2 draw with Crystal Palace last weekend</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T13:37:52+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 13:37</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Polden, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/jake-polden/</a></address>
      <p>Granit Xhaka has been left out of Arsenal's squad to face <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> this weekend, Gunners boss Unai Emery has confirmed.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> captain clashed with the fans during the 2-2 draw with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> last weekend, and is said to be "devastated" by the incident.</p>
      <p>Emery left the Swiss out of his Arsenal squad for Wednesday's Carabao Cup fourth-round defeat by <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> at Anfield.</p>
      <p>Xhaka, 27, was expected to return for the Gunners this weekend to skipper the side in the Premier League, but he will miss out.</p>
      <p>The midfielder sent a message to the Arsenal fans on Thursday night, but is yet to apologise for telling them to "f*** off".</p>

      <p>He wrote: "After taking some time to reflect on what happened on Sunday afternoon, I would like to give you an explanation rather than just a quick response.</p>
      <p>"The scenes that took place around my substitution have moved me deeply. I love this club and always give 100% on and off the pitch.</p>
      <p>"My feeling of not being understood by fans, and repeated abusive comments at matches and in social media over the last weeks and months have me deeply.</p>
      <p>"People have said things like "We will break your legs", "Kill your wife" and "Wish that your daughter gets cancer".</p>
      <p>"That has stirred me up and I reached boiling point when I felt the rejection in the stadium on Sunday.</p>
      <p>"In this situation, I let myself be carried away and reacted in a way that disrespected the group of fans that support our club, our team and myself with positive energy.</p>

      <p>"That has not been my intention and I'm sorry if that's what people thought.</p>
      <p>"My wish is that we get back to a place of mutual respect, remembering why we fell in love with this game in the first place. Let's move forward positively together. Granit."</p>
