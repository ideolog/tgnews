      <p>A Dumfries man has been jailed for subjecting his 62-year-old mum to a “frightening” ordeal while demanding money from her.</p>
      <p>Craig Hornby threatened her with violence and warned her: “I’ll blow up your car.”</p>
      <p>The sheriff court heard how Hornby repeatedly phoned and messaged her and turned up on her doorstep and demanded that she go to the bank to withdraw £100.</p>
      <p>As they did so, she went to steer the car towards the police station and he told her: “Don’t even think about it or I’ll break your jaw.”</p>
      <p>Jailing him for 200 days, Sheriff David Hall said: “For you, a man of 42, to treat your mother this way is deplorable.”</p>
      <p>Hornby, of Terregles Street, Dumfries, pleaded guilty to threatening his mum with violence and shouting and swearing at her at Laghall Court, Kingholm Quay, in September.</p>
      <p>He also admitted repeatedly demanding money, instructing her not to tell the police and forcing her to hand over £100 she withdrew from an ATM.</p>
      <p>The court was told that initially he sent text messages which she deleted and these were followed by telephone calls despite protests that she didn’t have money to give him.</p>
      <p>He eventually arrived at the house and demanded that she give him money and kept insisting that she give him cash.</p>
      <p>The fiscal depute said: “She then decided to take him to the bank and show him that she had no money and used the ATM to reveal that she had minus £8 in it.”</p>
      <p>But he maintained she had another account at another bank and she tried to steer him towards the police station.</p>
      <p>It was then that he threatened her with violence and that he would blow up her car.</p>
      <p>She was then forced to go to the other bank where she withdrew £100 and gave him the money before going to the police station.</p>
      <p>A solicitor said Hornby accepted that he had acted in a way which made her frightened.</p>
