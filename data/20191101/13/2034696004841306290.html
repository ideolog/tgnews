      <p>The ‘New Rules’ pop star <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/dua-lipa-review">signalled her “new era” at the beginning of the month</a> by posting an image of herself sporting a new blonde look. “Thank you for your patience. See you soon,” she told fans, who have been eagerly awaiting the follow-up to <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/dua-lipa-review">her 2017 self-titled debut</a>.</p>
      <p>Lipa described the new song ‘Don’t Start Now’ as a “pure adrenalin fuelled, feel good dance floor anthem of positivity and self-empowerment.”</p>
      <p>“I chose to put this song out first so I could close one chapter of my life and start another,” she said. “Into a new era with a new sound! It’s about moving on and not allowing anyone to get in the way of that. It also felt like a natural first song choice as I made it with the brilliant same crew I made ‘New Rules’ with.”</p>
      <p>On the infectious single, Lipa sings, “<i>Don’t show up/ Don’t come out/ Don’t start caring about me now/ Walk away/ You know how.”  </i></p>

      <p>This first taste of LP2 comes after Lipa revealed that the project would <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/dua-lipa-new-album-disco-influenced-2546572">have a “disco influence</a>“ and <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/dua-lipa-reveals-musical-influences-on-more-mature-sophomore-album-2544354">be “more mature</a>” compared to her first studio effort. The star also confirmed that she had <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/dua-lipa-studio-nile-rodgers-second-album-2471588">spent time in the studio with disco icon Nile Rodgers</a>.</p>
      <p>“My new record is still pop and it is really fun, but it is definitely more conceptual. I had the album title and went from that,” she explained.</p>
      <p>“It would prob­a­bly be risky if I <i>wasn’t </i>risky with the next record. ​I don’t think it would be as fun if I tried to recre­ate the first record. As an artist, you con­stant­ly want to grow and change your per­spec­tive and try some­thing new.”</p>
      <p>Dua Lipa has previously cited the likes of <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/prince">Prince</a>, <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/outkast">OutKast</a>, “old <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/gwen-stefani">Gwen Stefani</a>” and <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/no-doubt">No Doubt</a> as inspiration for her upcoming new album.</p>
