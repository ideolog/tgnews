      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 1 — The police uncovered a drug-processing laboratory and seized drugs worth RM2.2 million following the arrest of four men in raids in Kepong and Puchong, near here, on Tuesday and Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Kuala Lumpur police chief Datuk Seri Mazlan Lazim said the suspects are believed to be members of a secret society.</p>
      <p>He said the first raid was at a shopping centre on Jalan Kepong here at 2.10pm last Tuesday, during which two men were arrested.</p>
      <p>Following the arrest of the two suspects, the police were led to a condominium unit in Batu Caves, where they found various types of drugs and also arrested two more suspects who were in a car at Jalan Metro Perdana 7 on the same day, he told a media conference here today.</p>
      <p>He said the police searched the car and found 1,366g of heroin on the front passenger seat.</p>
      <p>Mazlan said the second raid was at a two-storey house in a new housing area in Bandar Metro Puchong at 11pm on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The house is believed to have been used as a drug-processing laboratory following the discovery of syabu and ketamine, as well as various chemicals used to produce drugs, he added.</p>
      <p>He said the four suspects, aged between 25 and 33, have been remanded for seven days to facilitate investigations. — Bernama</p>
