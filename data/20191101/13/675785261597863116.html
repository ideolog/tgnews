      <p>Manchester United have chartered a flight to Kasakhstan for their Europa League tie against Astana for around 100 fans who lost their bookings when Thomas Cook collapsed.</p>
      <p>Thomas Cook Sports, who were travel partners with United, had pre-sold travel packages to fans for the away leg of United's tie against Astana.</p>

      <p>A United spokesman said: "We have been working through a range of contingency plans to minimise the impact of the Thomas Cook situation for our supporters.</p>
