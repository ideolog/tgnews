      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T13:13:00+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 13:13</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.engadget.com/editors/christine-fisher" target="_blank">Christine Fisher</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015/12/29/smartisan-t2-china-smartphone/#/">rumored smartphone</a> by TikTok's owner ByteDance is now available. The <s>Nut</s> Jianguo Pro 3 is ByteDance's first smartphone. It's a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015/08/25/smartisan-u1-jianguo/">continuation</a> of work by the Chinese phone maker <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015/12/29/smartisan-t2-china-smartphone/#/">Smartisan</a> (which partially explains <a href="https://www.oppomart.com/smartisan-nut-pro-2.html">the name</a>), and it's being released under the Smartisan brand.</p>
      <p>As we <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/05/27/tiktok-owner-bytedance-plans-smartphone/">learned earlier this year</a>, ByteDance acquired a bunch of Smartisan patents and talent. ByteDance then helped make the Jianguo Pro 3 and packed it with branded features. Apparently, it didn't decide to change the naming scheme.</p>
      <p>Users will be able to launch Douyin -- the Chinese version of TikTok -- by swiping up on the lock screen, <a href="https://www.abacusnews.com/china-tech-city/first-smartphone-tiktok-maker-bytedance/article/3035886"><i>Abacus</i> reports</a>. They'll also be able to apply TikTok effects and filters to videos of any length. So, while the phone might still be under the Smartisan brand, it will give ByteDance a dedicated device and platform to share its apps and features in new ways.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://pandaily.com/smartisan-nut-pro-3-released-with-flagship-specs-starting-382/">Jianguo Pro 3</a> is on sale in China and starts at 2,899 yuan (about $412). It comes with Qualcomm's Snapdragon 855+ chipset, up to 12GB of RAM, 256GB of storage and four cameras.</p>
      <p><b>Update 11/02/19 11:41PM ET: </b>The official name of this phone is Jianguo Pro 3, not Nut Pro 3 (though "jianguo" does translate to "nut"). This article has been updated to reflect this correction.</p>
