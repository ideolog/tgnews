      <h2>Having breakfast delivered for free is a WINNER - especially tomorrow</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T13:51:36+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 13:51</time> by <a rel="author">Molly Holt, Max Channon</a></address>
      <p>The weather is going to be <a href="https://www.devonlive.com/news/local-news/hour-hour-met-office-guide-3490964">shocking tomorrow morning</a> and England are playing South Africa in the Rugby World Cup final, so you're not going to want to leave the house.</p>
      <p>Given that, what could be better than getting breakfast delivered to your door?</p>
      <p>Getting it delivered for free is the obvious answer - and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/mcdonalds">McDonald's</a> will do just that, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/mcdonalds-deliver-mcmuffins-your-house-20788354">reports The Mirror.</a> </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/mcdonalds">McDonald's</a> has just announced that it's offering free delivery on all McDonald's breakfast orders.</p>
      <p>To coincide with the Rugby World Cup tomorrow (Saturday 2 November), the fast food chain is ditching the delivery fee on all breakfast orders, so that fans of both food and sport can get their pre-match McMuffin delivered to their sofa for free.</p>
      <p>Usually £3.50, it will be available via Uber Eats to both new and existing customers, the free delivery will be available on McDonald's orders only - and you'll need a discount code to get it.</p>
      <p>If you're in the UK, you'll need to use the code  <b>MCDELIVERYUK19</b>  and if you're in Ireland, use  <b>MCDELIVERYIR19</b>  instead.</p>
      <p>You'll be able to order yours alongside the free delivery from between 5am and 12pm midday, meaning that the code will still work after breakfast finishes, to make way for any post-match (hopefully celebratory!) snacks.</p>
      <p>McDelivery is now available in over 950 restaurants, with McDonald's apparently expecting a big uplift in breakfast orders tomorrow as hungry fans watch the big match.</p>
      <p>All that's left to wonder is... is it socially acceptable to get McDonald's for both breakfast and lunch?</p>
