      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 1): Ivory Properties Group Bhd is disposing of its 45% interest in a Penang-based property development company for RM56.09 million.</p>
      <p>The buyer is Hemat Tuah Sdn Bhd, which currently owns the other 55% stake in the company, Tropicana Ivory Sdn Bhd (TISB).</p>
      <p>In a filing with Bursa Malaysia, Ivory said the disposal of the stake will enable it to realise gains from its investment in TISB and focus on other project developments.</p>
      <p>Ivory's wholly-owned subsidiary, Ivory Utilities Sdn Bhd, signed the shares sales agreement with Hemat Tuah today.</p>
      <p>According to Ivoryâ€™s earlier bourse filing dated Nov 11, 2011, TISB was involved in the development of 102.56 acres of land in Penang, with a gross development value of RM10 billion back then.</p>
      <p>TISB was originally a JV between Ivory and Tropicana Corp Bhd. Tropicana had on Oct 26 last year sold its 55% stake to Hemat Tuah.</p>
      <p>Ivory's share price closed unchanged at 18.5 sen today, giving the group a market capitalisation of RM90.67 million.</p>
