      <p>We're well used to eShop sales these days; publishers often use a cheeky price drop to get their game to the top of the charts and give it some much-needed visibility, but SimFabric has taken this to new lengths by hacking the price of Tocana's Dev's action title <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/preventive_strike">Preventive Strike</a></b> to just <i>2 cents.</i></p>
      <p>The game launched in May of this year for $1.99 / £1.59, so it was hardly an expensive game to start with. Still, the publisher is clearly hoping that, by bringing the cost of entry down to such a small amount, many players who baulked at the original price will now take the plunge.</p>
      <p>Is this good for the eShop, though? That's highly debatable, as it means this title – which we haven't played ourselves but can report scored a rather lukewarm <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/740280/Preventive_Strike/">6/10 on Steam</a> – will be suddenly catapulted to the upper regions of the eShop charts, where it will presumably gain more attention and more downloads.</p>
      <p>Does it deserve this extra attention? Probably not. Should you rush out and buy it? Again, probably not – unless you're short on games to play or are shopping on an especially tight budget.</p>
      <p>Still, it's easy to see why eShop publishers do this sort of thing; if your title has stopped selling, then you really do have nothing to lose by hacking the cost down and giving it a boost. In fact, you could argue that you have <i>everything</i> to gain in this 'race to the bottom', as you'll pick up sales – even if it's just 2 cents per copy.</p>
      <p>Let us know if you've been suckered in by this tactic by leaving a comment below – who knows, you may even feel that Preventative Strike is worth a look.</p>
