      <h1>Co Down man faces extradition from Republic over Essex lorry deaths</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T13:40:00+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 13:40</time> by <a rel="author">Henry Vaughan, David Young and Aoife Moore, Press Association</a></address>
      <p>A Co Down man is facing extradition from the Republic of Ireland over the deaths of 39 migrants found in the back of a lorry in Essex.</p>
      <p>Eamonn Harrison (22) appeared in Dublin High Court today after he was arrested on a European Arrest Warrant.</p>
      <p>He is charged with 39 counts of manslaughter, along with human trafficking and immigration offences, Essex Police said.</p>
      <p>The force said extradition proceedings have been started to bring Harrison, of Newry in Co Down, Northern Ireland, to the UK.</p>
      <p>He was remanded in custody in Cloverhill Prison, Dublin, until November 11, a court spokesman said.</p>
      <p>Harrison, from Newry, has been remanded in custody in Cloverhill Prison, Dublin, until November 11.</p>
      <p>It comes as local media reported police in Vietnam's Ha Tinh province arrested two people in connection with the deaths after launching an investigation into suspected human trafficking.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, it is understood wanted suspect Ronan Hughes (40) has twice spoken to police by telephone.</p>
      <p>Detectives have urged him and his brother Christopher (34) who are both from Co Armagh, to hand themselves in.</p>
      <p>The pair are wanted on suspicion of manslaughter and human trafficking after the bodies of eight women and 31 men were found in a refrigerated trailer attached to a lorry in an industrial park in Grays in the early hours of Wednesday October 23.</p>
      <p>Ronan Hughes is understood to have identified himself to a custody officer after calling Essex Police shortly after lorry driver Mo Robinson (25) was arrested following the discovery.</p>
      <p>A PSNI detective later called Hughes and had a conversation with him, it is understood.</p>
      <p>Essex Police Detective Chief Inspector Daniel Stoten told reporters at a press conference in Belfast: "Today I want to make a direct appeal - Ronan and Christopher, hand yourselves in to the PSNI.</p>
      <p>"We need you both to come forward and assist this investigation.</p>
      <p>"Although we have already spoken to Ronan Hughes recently by telephone, we need to have a conversation with him and his brother in person.</p>
      <p>"Talking to Ronan and Christopher is crucial to our investigation and the sooner we can make this happen the sooner we can progress and continue with our investigation."</p>
      <p>The detective said a lorry believed to be connected to the brothers was stopped and seized by the PSNI on Thursday but no further arrests were made.</p>
      <p>They are said to have links to the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, as well as with the road haulage and shipping industries.</p>
      <p>Robinson, from Craigavon, appeared at Chelmsford Magistrates' Court on Monday charged with 39 counts of manslaughter, conspiracy to traffic people, conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration and money laundering.</p>
      <p>Three other people arrested in connection with the incident - two men aged 38 and 46 and a 38-year-old woman - have been released on bail.</p>
      <p>The discovery has sparked a huge international investigation to try to identify the victims.</p>
      <p>Essex Police initially believed the 39 were all Chinese nationals but it is now thought Vietnamese men and women are among the dead.</p>
      <p>It is not yet known when the victims entered the trailer, where temperatures can be as low as -25C if the fridge is activated, or the exact route it travelled before crossing from Zeebrugge in Belgium to Purfleet.</p>
