      <p>JAKARTA: Traveloka, Southeast Asia's largest online travel startup, is looking to financial services to boost profits and could opt for a dual listing in Indonesia and another centre if the group launches an initial public offering (IPO), its president said.</p>
      <p>The seven-year-old startup joins other prominent local unicorns such as ride-hailing firm Gojek and e-commerce firm Tokopedia in considering dual listings to stay closer to their home market while also seeking a diverse investor pool.</p>

      <p>Traveloka Group President Henry Hendrawan declined to comment on its valuation or timing of any potential IPO but said it would consider a dual listing at home and in another centre such as the United States.</p>
      <p>"Listing in the US will have its benefits but we want to have the option to have some sort of local listing so perhaps dual listing will be a good structure," he said in an interview.</p>
      <p>Traveloka, backed by UStravel giant Expedia, Chinese online retailer JD.Com and Singapore state wealth fund GIC, claims 35 million active users in seven countries and has raised over US$900 million.</p>
      <p>Traveloka has eyed a listing as recently as early 2019 and had been in touch with technology bankers, people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.</p>
      <p>Its IPO plans appear to have been pushed back due to a slowing global economy and poor performance of newly listed firms such as Uber Technologies and a steep markdown in valuations of US office-space sharing firm WeWork.</p>
      <p>It has chosen instead to focus on fundraising and was in talks with investors to raise US$500 million earlier this year, one source said.</p>
      <p>Those talks put Traveloka's valuation at US$4.5 billion, The Wall Street Journal reported in July.</p>
      <p>"We are always in conversation with potential partners ... we are looking for potential partners that can take our capability to the next level," said Hendrawan.</p>
      <p>
        <b>EXPANSION</b>
      </p>
      <p>Originally focused on ticketing and hotel booking, Traveloka has moved into financial services. It has launched a credit card in Southeast Asia's largest economy with Bank Rakyat Indonesia .</p>
      <p>"Financial services overall started from almost zero early last year and we expect that it's going to be a US$1 billion business easily next year," Hendrawan said in an interview.</p>
      <p>Hendrawan, a former management consultant at Boston Consulting Group, said it was targeting "under-banked" Indonesian customers with its PayLater product, which provides consumer loans to customers to help them pay for services.</p>
      <p>Digital financial services in Southeast Asia are estimated to generate annual revenue of about US$38 billion by 2025, up sharply from US$11 billion in 2019, according to a report by consultants Bain &amp; Co, Google and Temasek this week.</p>
      <p>Traveloka is also focusing increasingly on travel and lifestyle "experiences" to grow its margins, taking on US rental company Airbnb and SoftBank-backed Hong Kong startup Klook.</p>
      <p>Traveloka launched its Xperience brand in July, proposing 15,000 activities and services, in a bid to become closer to a travel and lifestyle platform.</p>
