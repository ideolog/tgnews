      <p>NEW YORK (Reuters) - World equity markets surged and crude oil prices jumped on Friday after a stronger-than-expected U.S. employment report, a surprise bounce in Chinese manufacturing and optimism over U.S.-China trade talks tamped down fears of slowing global growth.</p>

      <p>Equity markets in Europe and across the Americas rallied, with the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq hitting closing record highs and MSCI’s gauge of equity performance across the globe rising to within 2.1% of its all-time peaks set in January 2018.</p>
      <p>The strong U.S. and Chinese data and remarks that an initial trade pact with China was near pushed up the price of oil, overshadowing a Reuters survey that showed crude prices are expected to remain under pressure through next year.</p>
      <p>U.S. and Chinese negotiators had made “enormous progress” toward reaching a “phase one” agreement, though the deal was not yet 100% complete, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told reporters.</p>
      <p>U.S. job growth slowed less than expected in October as the drag from a strike at General Motors (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/GM.N">GM.N</a>) was offset by gains elsewhere and hiring in the prior two months was stronger than previously estimated, data from the Labor Department showed.</p>
      <p>“This report isn’t weak enough to signal caution or a recession on the horizon,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors in Boston.</p>
      <p>“But the jobs market still isn’t strong enough to suggest that the Fed or other central banks should be tightening interest rates. Investors like that dynamic,” he said.</p>
      <p>The data should allay concerns about the health of the U.S. consumer in the fourth quarter, said Yousef Abbasi, global market strategist at INTL FCStone Financial Inc in New York.</p>
      <p>“The numbers were better than expected; this bodes well for the broader economy,” Abbasi said, referring to the jobs report.</p>
      <p>In China, the Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index for October rose to 51.7 from 51.4 the prior month, marking the third straight month of expansion. Economists had expected a dip in growth to 51.0.</p>
      <p>The data lifted Chinese blue chips <a href="https://www.reuters.com/finance/markets/index?symbol=.CSI300">.CSI300</a>, which jumped 1.7% in their best day since mid-August. Seoul's Kospi <a href="https://www.reuters.com/finance/markets/index?symbol=.KS11">.KS11</a> rose 0.8% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng <a href="https://www.reuters.com/finance/markets/index?symbol=.HSI">.HSI</a> added 0.7% on news of the manufacturing report.</p>
      <p>MSCI’s gauge of stock performance in 47 countries rose 0.81%, while the pan-European STOXX 600 index closed up 0.68%.</p>
      <p>On Bay Street in Toronto, the TSX composite index <a href="https://www.reuters.com/finance/markets/index?symbol=.GSPTSE">.GSPTSE</a> gained 0.67%, while in Mexico the Bolsa index <a href="https://www.reuters.com/finance/markets/index?symbol=.MXX">.MXX</a> rose 1.1% and in Brazil the Bovespa <a href="https://www.reuters.com/finance/markets/index?symbol=.BVSP">.BVSP</a> climbed 0.91%.</p>
      <p>The S&amp;P rose for the fourth straight week, its longest streak since February, while the Nasdaq has gained the past five weeks. Quarterly earnings have come in stronger than anticipated and U.S.-China trade rhetoric has appeared to be productive.</p>

      <p>On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average <a href="https://www.reuters.com/finance/markets/index?symbol=.DJI">.DJI</a> rose 301.13 points, or 1.11%, to 27,347.36. The S&amp;P 500 <a href="https://www.reuters.com/finance/markets/index?symbol=.SPX">.SPX</a> gained 29.35 points, or 0.97%, to 3,066.91 and the Nasdaq Composite <a href="https://www.reuters.com/finance/markets/index?symbol=.IXIC">.IXIC</a> added 94.04 points, or 1.13%, to 8,386.40.</p>
      <p>For the week, the Dow rose 1.44%, the S&amp;P 500 climbed 1.47% and the Nasdaq rose 1.74%, spurred by corporate earnings.</p>
      <p>About 76% of the 356 S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported so far have beaten profit estimates, according to Refinitiv data.</p>
      <p>U.S.-China trade tensions have slowed global growth and weighed on investor sentiment, with economic data showing slowing manufacturing output.</p>
      <p>The U.S. economy’s manufacturing sector contracted for a third straight month in October but at a slower pace than the previous month, an index from the Institute for Supply Management showed.</p>
      <p>Both Brent, the global benchmark, and U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate jumped more than 3%.</p>
      <p>Brent crude LCOc1 rose $2.07 to settle at $61.69 a barrel, while WTI crude CLc1 settled up $2.02 at $56.20 a barrel.</p>
      <p>The dollar slid as optimism that the United States and China will reach a deal to end their trade war reduced safe-haven demand for the greenback.</p>
      <p>The dollar index .DXY fell 0.13%, with the euro <a href="https://www.reuters.com/finance/currencies/quote?srcCurr=EUR&amp;destCurr=USD">EUR=</a> up 0.11% to $1.1162. The Japanese yen <a href="https://www.reuters.com/finance/currencies/quote?srcCurr=JPY&amp;destCurr=USD">JPY=</a> weakened 0.15% versus the greenback at 108.21 per dollar.</p>
      <p>Yields on U.S. government bonds rose after the jobs numbers but later pared some of the gains after the Institute for Supply Management’s manufacturing indexes were weaker than forecast.</p>
      <p>The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note US10YT=RR fell 8/32 in price to push its yield up to 1.719%.</p>
      <p>Euro zone government bond yields pushed higher on the economic signals from U.S. data and Christine Lagarde began her presidency of the European Central Bank.</p>
      <p>Most 10-year bond yields in the bloc rose around 2 basis points on the day after striking two-week lows on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Germany’s 10-year Bund yield was at -0.38% DE10YT=RR.</p>
