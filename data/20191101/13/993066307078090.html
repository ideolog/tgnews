      <p>Apple’s highly anticipated streaming service Apple TV+ has arrived, along with a range of programmes boasting big-name stars.</p>
      <p>It will go head to head with current contenders Netflix and Amazon, as well as soon-to-be-unveiled Disney+ and BritBox.</p>
      <p>If this is the start of the streaming wars, then Apple’s army is made up of top-tier Hollywood talent.</p>

      <p>Among them are Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston – last seen together on Friends – in The Morning Show, about a daytime TV show struck by a Me Too scandal.</p>
      <p>It also stars Steve Carell as the disgraced former anchor, a character reminiscent of fired NBC presenter Matt Lauer.</p>

      <p>A show hoping to lure younger viewers away from the clutches of Netflix is Dickinson, a vibrant half-hour drama about American poet Emily Dickinson, which combines 19th century period details with contemporary dialogue.</p>
      <p>It stars Wiz Khalifa as Death and features music by contemporary chart-toppers such as Billie Eilish.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, Game Of Thrones actor Jason Momoa heads up the drama See, penned by Peaky Blinders creator Steven Knight.</p>

      <p>Set 600 years in the future in a decimated America where human beings have lost the power of sight and have retreated to a new Dark Ages, the big-budget drama will be hoping to appeal to Thrones fans looking for a new favourite show.</p>
      <p>Also launching is For All Mankind, starring The Killing’s Joel Kinnaman, set in a world where the global space race never ended and the USSR made it to the Moon first.</p>

      <p>Still to come are new projects from creatives including Steven Spielberg, Oprah Winfrey and Jon M Chu, and Apple is promising new original shows every month.</p>
      <p>The service launched on Friday and will cost £4.99 per month after a seven-day trial, allowing access for up to six family members.</p>
      <p>One year of Apple TV+ is included when you buy a new iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch, Mac or Apple TV through the Apple TV app.</p>
      <p>It will also be available on smart TVs, streaming boxes and streaming sticks.</p>
