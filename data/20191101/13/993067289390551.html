      <p>Wales would be more likely to win the next Rugby World Cup under a Plaid Cymru government, the party has said.</p>
      <p>Its grassroots sports spokeswoman said Plaid would increase investment into Welsh sport following Wales’ 40-17 loss to New Zealand in a third place play-off game in Tokyo on Friday.</p>
      <p>Helen Mary-Jones said: “The route to success is investing in our young people, developing the sports men and women that will lead Wales on the sporting world stage in the future.</p>

      <p>“That is before we even mention the huge health benefits this programme would have.</p>
      <p>“With such a radical programme of investment, we can give Wales the best possible chance of winning the next World Cup.”</p>
      <p>Ms Mary-Jones said council budget cuts by the current Welsh Government under Labour meant spending on sports facilities and programmes had been cut by 36.3% compared to 2009/10.</p>
