      <h1>Donald Trump's 'Take the Oil' Strategy in Syria Is a Mistake</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T13:20:00+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 13:20</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://nationalinterest.org/" target="_blank">Paul R. Pillar</a></address>
      <p>Confusion has prevailed regarding the purposes of the U.S. troop presence in Syria, and whether the declared purposes are the actual ones. Originally the expedition was widely understood to be all about combating the Islamic State (ISIS) after the group had established a mini-state on a large portion of Syrian and Iraqi territory. Then hawks within the Trump administration and President Trump himself, in a classic case of mission creep, declared that the U.S. troops were also in Syria to “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/03/us/politics/trump-iraq-troops-syria-iran.html">watch Iran</a>”. Later variations of the creeped-up mission included not only watching Iran but also, through some unexplained mechanism, getting Iran and maybe Russia to abandon their positions in Syria.</p>
      <p>More recently, Trump has been under much pressure from various parts of the political spectrum to keep the U.S. military in Syria, in contradiction with his earlier stated intention to exit and his orders to redeploy troops that had been in the Kurdish-inhabited northeastern part of the country. Political pressures and contradictory tendencies are a prescription for even less clarity than before about what the troops’ mission is or ought to be. Trump, who is trying to milk as much political advantage as possible from the killing of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-death-isis-leader-abu-bakr-al-baghdadi/"> proclaimed</a> that because of al-Baghdadi’s death “the world is now a much safer place,” is resisting the idea that the original mission of combating ISIS in Syria is still necessary, at least in the general and open-ended way in which that mission was first framed. So now the declared mission has evolved yet again, with a new rationale that had<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/26/us/politics/trump-syria-oil-fields.html?action=click&amp;module=Spotlight&amp;pgtype=Homepage"> emerged</a> even before al-Baghdadi’s removal. Some U.S. troops are staying in eastern Syria, according to this rationale, to secure Syria’s modest oil resources.</p>
