      <p>#VISUAL ART</p>
      <p>The Permanent Collection: Walking with Saskatchewan</p>
      <p>MacKenzie Art Gallery, 3475 Albert St.</p>
      <p>Our upcoming permanent collection exhibition explores the diverse ways that artists in Saskatchewan have related to land, and how our objects carry stories and histories. Guest curated by Bruce Hugh Russell, this 10-month long exhibition will examine the history of Saskatchewan art and culture through Indigenous and settler perspectives, featuring a rotating selection of works primarily from the MAG’s permanent collection with select works that both highlight and help fill in the gaps in our collection.</p>
      <p>Mitchell Wiebe: <i>VampSites</i></p>
      <p>MacKenzie Art Gallery, 3475 Albert St.</p>
      <p><i>VampSites</i> is the latest exhibition from artist Mitchell Wiebe. Born and raised in Regina, Wiebe combines making and showing, employing a surreal personal lexicon and mythology of colours and textures, motifs and narratives, Wiebe imports the chaos and theatre of his studio into the well-lit, rational architecture of the art gallery. He adopts a distinctive persona who emerges from the same fictive world inhabited by his array of fantastical animalesque characters.</p>
      <p>Julie Oh: Selected Videos</p>
      <p>Dunlop Central Mediatheque, 2311 12th Ave.</p>
      <p>Julie Oh works with photography, video, and installation to examine our understanding of, and relationship with, everyday objects. Central Mediatheque will feature a selection of Oh’s strangely satisfying videos that test the properties of various materials and household goods.</p>
      <p>Liz Ikiriko: Flags of Unsung Countries</p>
      <p>Dunlop Sherwood Gallery, 2311 12th Ave.</p>
      <p>Runs until Nov. 15.</p>
      <p><i>Flags of Unsung Countries</i> is a photographic installation exploring new ceremonies, migration and embodied archives. Photographed in Canada and Nigeria, the work functions as a rite of passage. The exhibition charts the process of understanding a father’s struggles as an African immigrant challenged with mental illness living in the Canadian prairies. The layered images intersect geography and memory in a search for a location of belonging. The work asks the questions: How do we reconcile displacement with a sense of rootedness on adopted homelands? What is required of a home – is it a geography, a structure, a memory? Do we choose to belong or does it choose us? Flags of Unsung Countries uses photography as a language and an archive to map a path of the African diaspora. Using the medium of photography, for this exhibition, Liz Ikiriko documents a personal journey to learn more about her father, returning to meet family in Nigeria and places in Canada where she has lived. Her deeply personal and moving work explores memory, family and identity, and reimagines boundaries between past and present.</p>
