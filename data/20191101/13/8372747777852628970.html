      <p>LEE COUNTY, Fla. -- A Port Charlotte man will spend 10 years in prison for a deadly hit-and-run crash from 2016.</p>
      <p>In November 2016, Ronald Bray was driving recklessly in the southbound lanes of Interstate 75 at mile marker 135. That's the Colonial Boulevard exit.</p>
      <p>Bray swerved <a href="https://www.fox4now.com/news/driver-identified-in-fatal-i-75-crash-in-fort-myers">into the path of Brooke Fenton</a> , causing her to swerve off the road and crash into a parked tractor trailer parked at the shoulder.</p>
      <p>Bray then took off.</p>
      <p>He was convicted for vehicular homicide, leaving the scene involving death, and reckless driving.</p>
      <p>He will also serve five years of probation and pay restitution to Fenton's family. He must also do 100 hours of community service at a trauma center or a facility that deals with victims of car crashes.</p>
