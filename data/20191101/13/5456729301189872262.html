      <h1>EFCC Chairman Magu dodges question on Tinubu's bullion van petition</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T13:05:43+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 13:05</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/360566-efcc-chairman-magu-dodges-question-on-tinubus-bullion-van-petition.html" target="_blank">Kunle Sanni</a></address>
      <p>The acting chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Ibrahim Magu, has refused to answer a question on why the anti-graft agency has failed to probe the former Lagos State governor, Bola Tinubu, over cash-carrying bullion vans seen at his home on the eve of this year’s presidential election.</p>
      <p>The armoured vehicles usually deliver large sums of money to banks.</p>
      <p>On February 22, photos emerged on social media of two bullion vans entering Mr Tinubu’s property in Lagos.</p>
      <p>The former governor is a top leader of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC. He played<br/>influential roles in President Muhammadu’s election and reelection in 2015 and 2019.</p>
      <p>Mr Tinubu’s action was widely deemed as violating Nigeria’s anti-money laundering laws.</p>
      <p>Mr Tinubu later admitted the bullion vans were conveying money to his house, but defended his action, saying he did nothing wrong because he was not a government official.</p>
      <p>PREMIUM TIMES reported how Nigerians pressured the anti-graft office to <b><a href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/331537-efcc-keeps-mum-over-tinubus-bullion-vans-ahead-of-2019-election.html">open a money-laundering probe against Mr Tinubu</a></b>.</p>
      <p>Several months after the incident, the <a href="https://efccnigeria.org/">EFCC</a> has refused to probe the case despite mounting calls from Nigerians and civil society organisations.</p>

      <p>In October, the EFCC said on Twitter it failed to act because there was no petition. The agency dared a social media activist, Segun Awosanya, to send a petition against Mr Tinubu.</p>
      <p>In response to the challenge, political activist, Deji Adeyanju, on October 25 filed a formal petition demanding an investigation into the matter.</p>
      <p>Mr Adeyanju addressed the letter to the Acting Chairman of the anti-graft agency, Mr Magu.</p>
      <p>Speaking on Friday, a week later, Mr Magu avoided a question on the matter.</p>
      <p>He was addressing a press briefing on internet fraud at the agency’s headquarters in Abuja.</p>
      <p>Asked what he was doing about the petition, Mr Magu responded as, “Do you expect me to respond on the petition?”</p>
      <p>He did not give further details.</p>
