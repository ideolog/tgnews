      <blockquote>"At about 2:30 a.m. [00:30 GMT], unknown people drove up to the building on Diligiannis 50 [street] in Athens in two cars and, climbed the folding stairs to the second floor, where the Golden Dawn offices were located, broke the window and threw four gas cans, which caused a small fire," the police said.</blockquote>
      <p>Thereafter, officers at the scene chased the criminals, and during the pursuit, one of the cars rammed into a police vehicle, causing slight injuries to the public servants.</p>
