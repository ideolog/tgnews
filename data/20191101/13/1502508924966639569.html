      <h1>Google starts rolling out incognito mode for Google Maps on Android devices</h1>
      <h2>The new mode was first announced four months ago at Google IO, and has now started to land on smartphones globally</h2>

      <p>The US based search engine giant Google has started rolling out incognito mode for <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/google-maps">Google Maps </a>to Android devices.</p>
      <p>The new mode was first announced four months ago at Google IO, and has now started to land on smartphones globally.</p>
      <p>In this mode, users navigation history or searches will not be saved to the account and history will not reflect in the recommendations sections.</p>
      <p>"When you turn on Incognito mode, your activity in Maps-like the places you search or get directions to won't be saved to your Google Account," Olivia T, <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/google-maps">Google Maps </a>Community manager said in a statement recently.</p>
      <p>"Turning on Incognito mode in Maps does not affect how your activity is used or saved by internet providers, other apps, voice search, and other Google services," she added.</p>
      <p>Users with updated Preview Maps version 10.26 or above can access the feature by heading into the app, tapping their profile picture, then selecting "Turn on Incognito mode."</p>
