      <p>With the streaming wars heating up -- <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/01/apple-tv-plus-how-to-best-launch-deals/">Apple TV+ debuted today</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/10/29/hbo-max-will-launch-in-may-2020-with-curated-by-humans-push/">HBO Max launch details</a> were announced this week -- there are still some services that have a few cards to play before they start to roll out. Among them is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/17/nbcuniversal-streaming-service-peacock-the-office-parks-and-recreation/">Peacock, NBCUniversal's offering,</a> which might very well be free for everyone when it debuts in April.</p>
      <p>It's long been known that Peacock <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/01/14/nbcuniversal-free-tv-streaming-service-2020/">will be an ad-supported platform</a> (with between three and five minutes of ads per hour) and that cable subscribers and Comcast broadband users wouldn't have to pay extra for access. However, a report suggests NBCU might pull the trigger on making Peacock available to everyone at no cost, though a paid subscription may be an option for ad-free viewing.</p>
      <p>Comcast and other pay-TV subscribers might get extra benefits, such as additional content, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/01/nbc-peacock-may-be-free-for-all-users.html">according to <i>CNBC </i>sources.</a> As it stands, Peacock is scheduled to include more than 15,000 hours of shows and movies, including <i><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015/02/07/parks-and-recreation-privacy/">Parks and Recreation,</a> Cheers </i>and new shows from<i> <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/06/27/what-were-watching-the-good-place-and-westworld/">The Good Place</a></i> creator Mike Schur and <i>Saturday Night Live</i> chief Lorne Michaels. <i>The Office</i> <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/07/25/nbcuniversal-streaming-launch-the-office/">will be a Peacock streaming exclusive</a> <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/06/25/the-office-netflix-nbc/">from 2021.</a></p>
      <p>You can expect other originals, including reboots of <i><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016/02/11/battlestar-galactica-movie-starts-coming-together/">Battlestar Galactica,</a> Saved by the Bell</i> and <i>Punky Brewster.</i> There'll be plenty of other shows and movies from across the NBCUniversal brands as well.</p>
      <p>While there are <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/27/how-to-stream-more-and-spend-less/">other ad-supported, on-demand streaming services around,</a> if Peacock takes that approach, it'd be the only such platform run by a major media company to do so. As such, it'd surely pick up a host of users who might not want to pay subscriptions for other services. HBO Max, for instance, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/10/29/hbo-max-price/">will cost $15/month.</a> <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/04/03/netflix-us-price-increase-rollout/">Netflix</a> costs from $9/month, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/10/07/hulu-download-offline-viewing-no-ads-subscribers/">Hulu</a> starts at $6 (with ads), <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/10/apple-tv-plus-launch">Apple TV+</a> costs $5, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/10/14/disney-plus-twitter-promotion/">Disney+</a> will be $7 and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016/04/18/amazon-prime-video-is-now-a-standalone-monthly-service/">Amazon charges</a> $9/month for Prime Video.</p>
