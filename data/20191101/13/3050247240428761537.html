      <h1>NY Court Orders Veritaseum to Pay Back $8 Million From Illegal ICO</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T13:31:00+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 13:31</time> by <a rel="author">Helen Partz</a></address>
      <p>The CEO of <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/HindenburgResearch/united-states-securitiesandexchangevmiddletonetalnyedce190462500010-163254442">Delaware-registered</a> blockchain firm Veritaseum LLC and New York-registered Veritaseum Inc., Reggie Middleton, was ordered to pay $8.4 million in disgorgement, according to a new court order. Additionally, Middleton is liable for a civil penalty of $1 million, fintech publication FinanceFeeds <a href="https://financefeeds.com/court-orders-crypto-guru-reginald-middleton-company-veritaseum-pay-8-4m-disgorgement/">reported</a> on Nov. 1, citing a court order issued on Oct. 31.</p>
      <p>According to the report, a judge at the New York Eastern District Court has approved a motion for a consent judgment in a securities fraud case against several defendants involved in Veritaseum. Specifically, the defendants are jointly liable for disgorgement of $7,891,600, which represents a part of illegally <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-requests-freeze-on-assets-in-connection-with-alleged-15m-ico-fraud">earned</a> profits as well as prejudgment interest amount of $582,535.</p>
      <p>Moreover, the report states that the defendants will not be allowed to engage in any offering of digital security, in accordance with the court order. </p>
      <h3>Middleton asks the court for more time to respond to the complaint</h3>
      <p>The case was first brought up by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in mid-August 2019 when the authority <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-requests-freeze-on-assets-in-connection-with-alleged-15m-ico-fraud">filed</a> a complaint against Middleton as well as two of his firms. </p>
      <p>In the document, the SEC alleged that the entities were responsible for an unregistered $14.8 million initial coin offering from late 2017 to 2018 and requested a U.S. District Court to freeze the defendants’ assets.</p>
      <p>On Oct. 9, the SEC <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-enters-settlement-talks-with-alleged-fraudulent-firm-veritaseum">entered</a> settlement talks with Veritaseum, reportedly rescheduling the initial conference at the New York Eastern District Court for Nov. 14, 2019. Since Oct. 9, Veritaseum (<a href="https://coin360.com/coin/veritaseum-veri">VERI</a>) has dropped about 37% from $24 to $15 per coin at press time, according to Coin360.</p>
