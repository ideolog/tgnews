      <h1>Unai Emery confirms role Mesut Ozil will play against Wolves</h1>
      <h2>The Arsenal midfielder was brought in from the cold for Wednesday night's Carabao Cup thriller against</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T13:56:10+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 13:56</time> by <a rel="author">Mike Walters, https://www.facebook.com/Mike-Walters-Mirror</a></address>
      <p>Mesut Ozil is in line to make only his second Premier League appearance of the season for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> .</p>
      <p>The German World Cup winner impressed manager Unai Emery in his 65-minute appearance at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> in midweek – his first outing since September 24.</p>
      <p>And with skipper Granit Xhaka ruled out, it may have been enough to earn the Gunners' £350,000-a-week enigma a rare start at the Emirates this weekend.</p>
      <p>Emery was happy with the impact of his fringe players, including Ozil, at Anfield and said: “For them each match is a challenge to show how they can help us.</p>
      <p>“I'm thinking also how they can help us tomorrow (against Wolves).”</p>

      <p>Team-mate Sead Kolasinac had earlier admitted Ozil was peeved at being cast into exile, saying: “Mesut is a really driven player, but he is a bit unhappy at the minute.</p>
      <p>“He is doing everything he can. He is doing extra sessions to make sure he is at the level he needs to be.”</p>
      <p>Ozil's only Premier League apperance this season was on September 13, in a 2-2 draw at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/watford-fc">Watford</a> , and until Wednesday night's crazy Carabao Cup defeat at Liverpool he had not even featured in six consecutive matchday squads.</p>

      <p>But Emery and Ozil had a clear-the-air talk before the Gunners' agonising shoot-out defeat at Anfield, and the Arsenal manager singposted his intention to use the German World Cup winner against Wolves, saying: “Yes, he will feature. We will look at the possibility to use him again.”</p>
      <p>The Arsenal manager's hand may have been forced, to an extent, when the Emirates atmosphere was thick with mutiny as the Gunners surrendered a two-goal lead against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> last Sunday.</p>
      <p>Fans called for Ozil, who maintained inscrutable as he watched from the bench.</p>
