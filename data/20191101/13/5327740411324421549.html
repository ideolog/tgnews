      <h1>Ten-year milestone for outreach dental clinic in White Rock</h1>
      <h2>Nearly 3,000 patients treated, says Sources</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T13:00:00+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.northdeltareporter.com/author/tracy-holmes/" target="_blank">Tracy Holmes</a></address>
      <p>Sources is celebrating a milestone this year – the tenth anniversary of its volunteer dental clinic.</p>
      <p>According to a news release, the clinic – established to assist those who struggle to afford or access dental care – has helped approximately 3,000 people since first opening its doors to the community in Peace Arch Hospital in 2009.</p>
      <p>The outreach initiative was kickstarted by retired Semiahmoo Peninsula dentist Ken Stones 11 years ago, after he realized, while volunteering at a similar clinic in Abbotsford, that suitable space to offer the service locally existed in the hospital’s Weatherby Pavilion.</p>
      <p>After a year of getting things in order, the clinic treated its first patient in October 2009.</p>
      <p>Volunteer dentists can access the clinic three times a week. There are currently eight who do; each is asked to commit to six four-hour shifts a year. Patients, referred through Sources, can access basic dental care, including pain relief, restorations, extractions and cleaning.</p>
      <p>Sources estimates the annual cost of operating the clinic at $25,000.</p>
      <p>Grants are integral to keeping it going. A pair of them from Semiahmoo Rotary Club – $5,000 each – went a long way in the clinic’s early years, as did a $10,000 donation from Prime Time Living in 2015.</p>

      <p>More recently, Peace Arch Hospital Foundation committed to a three-year grant, and funds from the provincial government enabled upgrades to the clinic’s circa-1998 equipment.</p>
      <p>The search for ongoing funding continues, the Sources’ news release states. Additionally, after 50 years in dentistry – as well as years of organizing international dental outreach trips – Stones says he is feeling ready to pass the torch on running the clinic.</p>
