      <p>Essex Police have revealed that they have spoken by telephone to fugitive Ronan Hughes who they want to question over the deaths of 39 people found in the back of a lorry in Essex.</p>
      <p>The news comes amid heightened concerns over people smuggling into the UK, following the discovery of 39 bodies in the back of a refrigerated lorry in Grays, Essex last week.</p>
      <p>It is not yet known when the victims entered the trailer, but it arrived at Zeebrugge in Belgium on October 22, and reached Purfleet in Essex at around 12.30am the following day.</p>
      <p>Just over an hour later police were called to the Waterglade Industrial Park on Eastern Avenue in Grays where the bodies of 31 men and eight women had been discovered.</p>
      <p>Mo Robinson, 25, of Craigavon, Northern Ireland, appeared at Chelmsford Magistrates' Court on Monday charged with 39 counts of manslaughter, conspiracy to traffic people, conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration, and money laundering.</p>
      <p>Essex Police are also looking for Ronan Hughes, 40, and his brother Christopher, 34, both from from Armagh in Northern Ireland, who are suspected of manslaughter and human trafficking.</p>
      <p>Twelve migrants have been found alive in the back of a refrigerated lorry in Belgium.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>Local media reported that the men had crawled into the back of the vehicle near Antwerp on Tuesday, prompting the driver to contact police.</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman for the Belgian federal police said that traffic officers had gone to check the lorry, which was carrying fruit and vegetables, and found 11 Syrians and one Sudanese man.</p>
      <p>They were taken to a police office in Antwerp and are now being dealt with by immigration officials.</p>
