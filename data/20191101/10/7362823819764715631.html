      <h1>Joel Embiid, Karl-Anthony Towns each suspended 2 games</h1>

      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nba/philadelphia-76ers">Philadelphia</a> center Joel Embiid and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nba/minnesota-timberwolves">Minnesota</a> center Karl-Anthony Towns have each been suspended two games without pay for an <a href="https://www.nba.com/article/2019/10/31/nba-suspends-joel-embiid-karl-anthony-towns">on-court altercation</a> and continued escalation.</p>
      <p>Kiki VanDeWeghe, the NBA's executive vice president of basketball operations, announced the suspensions Thursday, a day after the undefeated 76ers' 117-95 home victory over the Timberwolves.</p>
      <p>The star players were ejected after tangling with 6:42 left in the third quarter and the 76ers ahead 75-55. Embiid shoved Towns, who answered with a punch that missed as both men fell to the floor. Philadelphia's Ben Simmons jumped in and forcefully held Towns down as other players and coaches ran onto the court.</p>
      <p>"I didn't throw any punches, so I shouldn't get suspended," Embiid said Wednesday night.</p>
      <p>They were ejected after a video review.</p>
      <p>"We deemed the altercation a fight. Therefore, by rule, they're both ejected," said Mark Ayotte, the officials' crew chief. "I just saw them each lock arms. And that escalated to the fight."</p>
      <p>Gersson Rosas, the Timberwolves' president of basketball operations, issued a statement after the suspensions were handed down.</p>
      <p>"While we are disappointed with the league's decision, we understand the magnitude of this unfortunate incident," Rosas said. "The NBA is highly competitive and last night was a reflection of that. We support Karl and will move forward together as a group."</p>
      <p>Embiid will sit out Saturday night at Portland and Monday night at Phoenix. He's averaging 23.3 points and 10.3 rebounds in three games this season.</p>
      <p>Towns will miss games Saturday night at Washington and Monday night at home against Milwaukee. He's averaging 27.3 points and 11.5 rebounds in four games.</p>
