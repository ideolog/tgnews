      <h1>Open warfare in Bangkok’s Samyan area this weekend at PUBG mobile tourney</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T10:36:32+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 10:36</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/Coconuts%20Bangkok" target="_blank">Coconuts Bangkok</a></address>
      <p>While Thailand plays host to heads of state throughout ASEAN this weekend, another high-stakes event in the capital is drawing far more attention the world over.</p>
      <p>Five Thai teams will wage running gun battles in a desperate bid to be the last ones standing and claim a purse of over THB3 million (US$99,500) in Bangkok this weekend as part of the Southeast Asian finals for PUBG Mobile Club.</p>
      <p>They will face off against 11 other teams hailing from Vietnam, Malaysia and Cambodia. The top two teams will go on to the Global Final to be held Nov. 29 to Dec. 1 in Malaysia.</p>
      <p>For the unilluminated, PUBG mobile means this esports tournament is centered on the phone-playable version PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, one of the first massively popular battle royale games that gave rise to Fortnite and Apex Legends.</p>
      <p>Registered PubG mobile players who attend will get 3,000 “battle points.”</p>
      <p>Entry is free. The event runs Saturday and Sunday at Samyan Mitrtown Hall on the fifth floor of the new mall on Rama IV Road.</p>
