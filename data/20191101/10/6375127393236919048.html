      <h1>Revised manual on GCTA law out soon –– DOJ official</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T10:27:48+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 10:27</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://journal.com.ph/authors/hector-lawas" target="_blank">Hector Lawas</a></address>
      <h3>THE joint Justice and Local Government committee is set to finish the revision of the uniform manual on the Good Conduct Time Allowance (GCTA) law in two weeks time.</h3>
      <p>Justice Undersecretary Deo Marco, who heads the joint DOJ-DILG committee conducting the review, disclosed that the review of the manual is already 50 percent complete.</p>
      <p>The review of the manual was made after the DOJ and DILG signed last September 16 the revised implementing rules and regulations (IRR) of Republic Act (RA) 10592 which is known as the GCTA law.</p>
      <p>The same joint DOJ-DILG committee also made the revision of the IRR.</p>
      <p>Marco, who also has supervision over the Bureau of Corrections (BuCor), has assured the joint committee has encountered no hitches in the review of the manual.</p>
      <p>“Dapat lang in accordance with the IRR,” the DOJ official explained.</p>
      <p>“Although mas madugo ito kasi mas specific na nilalagay namin, di tulad sa IRR we can be general,” said Marco as he explained the reason why the review of the manual needed much more time</p>
      <p>The joint committee was given only around half a month, from August 30 to September 12, to review the IRR.</p>
