      <p>US President Donald Trump announced Thursday that he will change his permanent residence from New York to Palm Beach, Florida, claiming he had been "treated very badly" in his native city.</p>
      <p>"My family and I will be making Palm Beach, Florida, our Permanent Residence," the president tweeted.</p>
      <p>"I cherish New York, and the people of New York, and always will, but unfortunately, despite the fact that I pay millions of dollars in city, state and local taxes each year, I have been treated very badly by the political leaders of both the city and state," he wrote, adding: "Few have been treated worse."</p>
      <p>However, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo hit back at the president tweeting: "Good riddance."</p>
      <p>"It's not like @realDonaldTrump paid taxes here anyway," he wrote.</p>
      <p>"He's all yours, Florida."</p>

          <b>Trump impeachment inquiry: US House to hold first vote on probe</b>

        <b>Tax purposes</b>
      </p>
      <p>According to a report from The New York Times, Trump - who is a native New Yorker - and his wife Melania filed individual declarations of domicile in September changing their primary residence from Manhattan to Palm Beach.</p>
      <p>The New York Times also wrote that White House officials declined to say why Trump changed his primary residence but cited a source close to the president as saying it was primarily for tax purposes.</p>

          <b>Embattled Trump leaves New York angry, bitter</b>
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>Other than the White House, the Trumps' main residence will now be their Mar-a-Lago resort, where Trump has spent 99 days since becoming president - compared to just 20 at his previous primary residence in Trump Tower, according to the Times.</p>
      <p>"I hated having to make this decision, but in the end it will be best for all concerned," Trump tweeted.</p>
      <p>New York "will always have a special place in my heart!"</p>
      <p>But New York has not always loved Trump back: Demonstrations outside Trump Tower are common, and Trump has butted heads with the city and state multiple times.</p>
      <p>The most recent instance was in the beginning of the month, when a federal judge for the Southern District of New York dismissed the president's bid to block access to years of his personal and corporate tax returns.</p>
