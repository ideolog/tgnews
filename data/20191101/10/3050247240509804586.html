      <h1>Monero Futures Begin Trading on Dubai-Based Crypto Exchange</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T10:21:00+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 10:21</time> by <a rel="author">Jack Martin</a></address>
      <p>Dubai-based multi-currency and spot/futures exchange, BTSE, <a href="https://www.blog.btse.com/post/btse-launches-monero-futures-trading">unveiled</a> its Monero (<a href="https://coin360.com/coin/monero-xmr">XMR</a>) futures trading, Oct. 31. The move makes it one of the first and only exchanges offering futures contracts on the privacy-focussed cryptocurrency.</p>
      <h3>Bucking the trend of exchanges delisting privacy-focused coins</h3>
      <p>BTSE is a relatively unknown, low-volume exchange that is licensed by the Department of Economic Development, Government of Dubai and is under the regulations of the Central Bank of United Arab Emirates, <a href="https://www.btse.com/en/home">according</a> to its website. </p>
      <p>The decision to list Monero comes at a time when the popular privacy coin is being delisted from several other exchanges. Despite having proved its longevity, its focus on anonymity entails potential regulatory risk.</p>
      <p>Pressure from the Financial Action Task Force, while <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/fatfs-regulations-to-push-criminals-to-privacy-coins-ciphertrace-ceo">driving criminals towards Monero</a> and other privacy coins, is also causing some platforms to delist them.</p>
      <p>Blockchain analysis firms such as CipherTrace, for example, are working with regulators and law-enforcement agencies to <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/ciphertrace-expands-monitoring-platform-to-700-tokens">track an increasing number of cryptocurrencies</a>, though privacy-focused Monero and Zcash are notably absent from the list of monitored tokens.</p>
      <h3>How to list privacy coins in a regulatorily-compliant fashion</h3>
      <p>But CEO of BTSE, Jonathan Leong, believes that privacy is an important aspect of a strong digital currency, and that listing Monero can provide authorities with a yardstick by which to assess best practices for listing such tokens. </p>
      <p>Leong:</p>
      <blockquote>“In listing Monero, we hope not only to provide our users with more choice when it comes to their trading needs, but to spark a conversation on how to list privacy coins in a regulatorily-compliant fashion.”</blockquote>
      <p>As Cointelegraph <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-futures-volume-is-now-at-50-of-spot-trading-volume">recently reported</a>, cryptocurrency futures trading is rapidly catching up to spot trading in terms of volume.</p>
