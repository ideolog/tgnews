      <h2>Emmerdale's Belle and Vinny Dingle aren't actually related, but fans are still expecting a relationship to form between them</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T10:01:52+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 10:01</time> by <a rel="author">Charlotte Tutton</a></address>
      <p>Emmerdale fans have predicted a new incest twist will rock the Dales, after sensing an attraction between cousins Belle Dingle and Vinny Dingle.</p>
      <p>What Belle and the family don't currently know is that Vinny isn't actually a Dingle, because he's not really Mandy's son despite their claims.</p>
      <p>Amid his real identity being confirmed, the family believe he is her child - making him the great-nephew of Zak Dingle, and a cousin once removed of Cain and sister Belle.</p>
      <p>Mandy is Zak's neice, the daughter of his brother Caleb, with Zak's children Belle and Cain being her cousins.</p>
      <p>In recent scenes, Vinny appeared to take a liking to Belle, and now some viewers are convinced the soap is lining up a new romance.</p>

      <p>Despite the pair not actually being related, Belle and her family currently believe this to be the case, so if something was to happen fans believe it would be inappropriate.</p>
      <p>Taking to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> , one viewer said: "Has Vinny a crush on 'cousin' Belle <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Emmerdale?src=hashtag_click">#Emmerdale</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Dingle?src=hashtag_click">#Dingle</a> family."</p>
      <p>Another said: "Belle and Vinny are going to fall for each other arenâ€™t they?"</p>

      <p>A third added: "Vinny suddenly taking a fancy to Belle must have been an emergency re-write from Ellis taking off to Dubai!"</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, a fourth referenced the Dingle family's history with incestuous romances by adding: "Surely if Vinny doesn't have a go at Belle or another Dingle it'll look suspicious."</p>
      <p>Mandy herself married her own cousin Butch, the son of Zak, before she moved on with Paddy Kirk.</p>

      <p>Then there was Cain's romance with cousin Charity Dingle, the daughter of Zak's cousin Obadiah, with the pair having a child together, Debbie Dingle.</p>
      <p>Charity also slept with another cousin, Marlon Dingle, back in 2003 - with Marlon's father Albert being Zak's brother and therefore Obadiah's cousin.</p>
      <p>It remains to be seen who exactly Vinny is, and how the Dingles will react when they find out he's not one of their own.</p>
