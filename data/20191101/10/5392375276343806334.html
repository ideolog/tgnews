      <p>Since 5G smartphones hit the Chinese market, the price of 5G mobile phones has been going down at an alarming rate. This is actually a very good thing for consumers. Yesterday, the three major Chinese carriers officially announced the 5G packages for China. If you are ready for 5G, in addition to a 5G card or a 5G package, you will need a 5G phone. Many may want to ask, “which is the cheapest 5G smartphone?”. Well, it is currently the <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/iqoo-pro-5g">iQOO Pro 5G</a> which is presently selling for 3398 yuan ($483).</p>

      <p>This device came with a 3,798 yuan ($539) price tag and it was the cheapest at the time of its release. However, the Xiaomi Mi 9 Pro 5G beat it a few weeks later with its 3699 yuan price tag. Now, iQOO decided to activate a 400 yuan price cut which makes this device the cheapest 5G smartphone. This deal is available on vivo official flagship store and Tmall.</p>
      <p>The iQOO Pro 5G is available in 8GB+12GB, 12GB+128GB and 8GB+256GB configurations. There is a straight 100 yuan ($14) price cut as well as a 300 yuan  ($42) coupon. This takes the final price to 3398 yuan ($483) and 3698 yuan ($525) for the lower variants. However, the price of the high 8GB+256GB version remains at 3998 yuan ($568). It is worth mentioning that the first top 2,000 buyers will get a Bluetooth headset worth 359 yuan ($51).</p>
