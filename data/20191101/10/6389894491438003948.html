      <h1>Brexit stockpiling fails to save UK manufacturing from recession</h1>

      <p>The UK manufacturing sector looked to be firmly stuck in recession as Brexit stockpiling could not prevent a sixth month of contraction in October, a closely followed survey found today.</p>
      <p>Jobs, new orders and factory ouput all fell last month, according to IHS Markit’s UK Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI).</p>

      <p>Factory bosses blamed ongoing Brexit chaos, with the UK avoiding a no-deal Brexit yesterday as <a href="https://www.cityam.com/eu-grants-full-extension-to-brexit/">the EU granted a three-month delay until the end of January 2020</a>.</p>
      <p>That did not stop firms from stockpiling ahead of the deadline, giving the manufacturing sector a boost that is unlikely to be repeated in November.</p>
      <p>Business confidence improved mildly to hit a three-month high. But economic and political uncertainty continued to weigh down on manufacturers’ outlooks, with that optimism at one of its lowest levels since 2012.</p>
      <p>Duncan Brock, group director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, warned Brexit continued to stymy manufacturers alongside the prospect of an election in December.</p>
      <p>“A minor uplift in overall purchasing activity did little to ease the agony for manufacturing companies in October,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Business was still restrained by the Brexit leash, as firms were subjected to the struggle against client indecision and also the downpull of a slowing global economy.”</p>
      <p>UK factory activity climbed from its weak level of <a href="https://www.cityam.com/uk-manufacturing-sparks-recession-fears-as-job-losses-mount/">just 48.3 in September, which put the sector on the brink of a recession</a>.</p>
      <p>Brexit stockpiling pushed that figure to a four-month high ahead of the 31 October departure date.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile <a href="https://www.cityam.com/uk-manufacturing-activity-plunges-to-seven-year-low-as-economic-slowdown-bites/">the industry plunged to a seven-year low in August</a> thanks to Brexit turmoil and a global economic slowdown.</p>
      <p>August saw the sector post a PMI score of 47.4, where anything below 50 represents a contraction.</p>
      <h3>Future for UK manufacturing ‘even darker’</h3>
      <p>Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit, added that the future for UK manufacturing looks “even darker” than October’s numbers suggest.</p>
      <p>“The high degree of uncertainty is hitting two areas of the manufacturing economy especially hard,” he said.</p>
      <p>“The first is the trend in employment, as job losses resulting from disappointing sales are exacerbated by manufacturers implementing hiring freezes until the outlook clears.</p>
      <p>“The second is the investment goods industry, where output and new orders are falling sharply as clients postpone capital spending plans.”</p>
      <p>Rather than easing fears, Dobson said the three-month extension to Brexit coupled with a December general election will only create more problems for the sector.</p>
      <p>“It looks as if the spectre of uncertainty will cast its shadow over manufacturing for the remainder of 2019,” he added.</p>
      <p>Capital Economics’ senior UK economist, Ruth Gregory, concurred, saying a rates cut is on the horizon.</p>
      <p>“If Brexit is delayed again beyond 31 January, and the economy remains weak as we expect, then we still think that the Bank of England will cut rates – perhaps by 25 basis points in May 2020.”</p>
      <h3>UK manufacturing figures ‘consistent with a recession’</h3>
      <p>Gregory sounded the alarm over the figures, warning they were “consistent with a recession in the manufacturing sector”.</p>
      <p>She warned that “temporary factors” fuelled October’s slight pick-up from September.</p>
      <p>“Indeed, the rise in the stocks of purchases balance from 53.6 to 55.6, presumably driven by firms stockpiling in case of a no-deal Brexit, accounted for 0.2 points of the total 1.3 point rise in the PMI,” she pointed out.</p>
      <p>The PMI is also pointing to a 0.7 per cent quarter-on-quarter drop as the sector heads into the fourth quarter.</p>
      <p>“Overall, then, it looks like the manufacturing sector is back in recession,” Gregory said. </p>
      <p>“And with the other sectors showing little growth, we are expecting the economy to expand by no more than 0.2 per cent to 0.3 per cent quarter-on-quarter.</p>
