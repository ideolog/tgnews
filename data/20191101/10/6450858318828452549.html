      <h1>Where to buy Football Manager 2020</h1>
      <h2>The beta for the hugely popular management simulator has arrived. Here's how you can purchase the full game ahead of its release date.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T10:00:00+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 10:00</time> by <a rel="author">Anyron Copeman</a></address>
      <p>Ever since initial launch as Championship Manager in 1992, the Football Manager games have been the definitive simulator for those looking to take charge of their favourite team. </p>
      <p>Combined with FIFA, it has provided a comprehensive video game experience for fans of the beautiful game. However, FM has always been considered more in-depth, offering granular control over nearly every aspect of how a club is run.</p>
      <p>FM 2020 looks set to continue that trend, and will be released on <b>19 November</b>. A fully playable beta is available now, having been released a full five days ahead of schedule.</p>

      <p>If you're looking to pick up the game ahead of release, the good news is that you can pre-purchase now, meaning you'll be ready to download once it's available. The full version of the game will only be playable on PC and Mac, with <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/news/game/google-stadia-news-3693903/">Google Stadia</a> to follow despite it also releasing on 19 November. </p>
      <p>FM Touch and FM Mobile will be available on both the App Store and Google Play on the same date. </p>

      <h3>How to pre-order a physical copy</h3>
      <p>Physical copies of PC games are much rarer than their console equivalents, not least because so many laptops no longer have a disc drive. While it is still available for Windows devices, physical Mac games are not supported as they have been without one since 2011. </p>
