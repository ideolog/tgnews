      <p>A women who jokingly called a shop assistant a d**khead feels like staff are staring at her following her ban from the shop.</p>
      <p>Rakel Bryan was barred from the Hull store after having an argument with a member of staff over cigarette papers.</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old was challenged by the vendor about her age when she tried to buy the smoking paraphernalia, prompting her to blurt out the slur.</p>
      <p>“I said 'aw shut up d**khead', as a joke. I thought he was laughing with me and then he said, ‘no I’m being serious’," Rakel said.</p>
      <p>“I said ‘how dare you ID me?’.</p>

      <p>“I had a panic attack, I felt like everyone was staring at me.”</p>
      <p>The day after the October 16 confrontation Rakel was "frog marched" from the shop and handed a three year ban, <a href="https://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/news/hull-east-yorkshire-news/hull-woman-banned-asda-staff-3487634">Hull Daily Mail reported</a> .</p>
      <p>But the spurned shopper has to accompany her mum - who has mobility issues - to the Asda shop, leading to awkward encounters.</p>
      <p>"I feel like I'm being treated like a criminal and feel really intimidated when I go near the store," she said.</p>
      <p>"I have to hang about where my mum goes to do her shopping in 15 to 20 minutes.</p>

      <p>"It's like I'm a naughty child and I have to stand outside on the naughty step or something.</p>
      <p>"It's been four or five times where I have been to Asda, and because my mum is unsteady on her feet we wouldn't go into town [city centre].</p>
      <p>"We eat fresh and visit [Asda] most days to get ingredients for our tea."</p>
      <p>In a further meeting with the store manager Rakel was told she had been banned because she 'had been racist", she claimed.</p>
      <p>She refuted the suggestion and spoke about how the ban had impacted her life.</p>

      <p>"Staff members are eyeballing while I'm stood outside - it's a little bit embarrassing more than anything," Rakel added.</p>
      <p>"It has just been blown out of proportion and now I have to stand outside like a naughty child."</p>
      <p>An Asda spokesperson confirmed the ban and said: "While we would never discuss individual circumstances, we take any concerns of this nature seriously and will not tolerate any form of abuse or discrimination towards our customers or colleagues."</p>
