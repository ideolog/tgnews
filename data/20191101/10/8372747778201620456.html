      <p>FORT MYERS, Fla. -- Motorists are being warned of two overnight road closures along a section of Alico Road east of Interstate 75 this weekend.</p>
      <p>According to the Lee County Government, crews will need to replace drainage pipes across the road as part of the Alico Road Widening Project.</p>
      <p>As a result, Alico Road will be completely closed from 7 p.m. until 6 a.m. on the nights of Friday, November 1 and Saturday, November 2.</p>
      <p>The affected segment is between Ben Hill Griffin Parkway and Airport Haul Road. That's just east of Gulf Coast Town Center.</p>
