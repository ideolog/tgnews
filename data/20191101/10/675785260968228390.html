      <h1>Man Utd 'eyeing £100m Lautaro Martinez transfer' to spearhead attack</h1>
      <h2>The Inter Milan forward has starred for his club so far this season, attracting interest from the Red Devils</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T10:59:34+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 10:59</time> by <a rel="author">Darren Wells, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/darren-wells/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> are reportedly weighing up a move for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/inter-milan">Inter Milan</a> striker Lautaro Martinez.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old has been in good form for the Nerrazurri so far this season, netting seven times in 13 appearances, while also banging in a hat-trick for Argentina.</p>
      <p>United are short of options up front, having sold Romelu Lukaku to the Serie A club in the summer, as well as loaning them Alexis Sanchez.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/01/football-transfer-rumours-lautaro-martinez-to-manchester-united">The Guardian</a> report that United are considering making use of their recent business relations by moving for Martinez.</p>
      <p>However they add that United will have to fork out up to £100 million to prise him from the San Siro.</p>

      <p>Martinez has been a regular under manager Antonio Conte since the former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> boss arrived in summer.</p>
      <p>His form for his club has dramatically improved in this campaign, having fired an average of a goal every two games, compared to one in every four last season.</p>
      <p>United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has limited firepower in his ranks, with Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial the only established strikers.</p>
      <p>Youngster Mason Greenwood has also been involved in first-team action, but is still yet to start a game in the Premier League.</p>

      <p>RB Salzburg hotshot Erling Braut Haaland is another on United's radar, with the club ready to battle <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> for his signature.</p>
      <p>The 19-year-old has been banging the goals in for the Austrian outfit, and has teased a move to England.</p>
      <p>But Juventus are confident of securing his talents with a £35 million bid, due to their close relations with Haaland's agent Mino Raiola, who is keen for his client to move to Turin.</p>
