        <i>“And yes, if a challenge is created due to new rule changes, then that is also a challenge for me as a driver. I have to use my skills and knowledge of the previous seasons to push the team in the right direction in order to achieve consistent, good performances again."</i>

        <i>“I don't necessarily see myself driving anywhere else. I love driving at Mercedes and being part of the brand. Be a part of history. I have been driving here since I was 13, so the idea of ​​staying with them, even after Formula 1, is something that appeals to me. Logically, I will continue to race for a few years and I want to win in those years."</i>
      </p>
      <p>Hamilton will like the challenge of a new set of regulations and will hope that 2021 is the season where he can beat Michael Schumacher's record. </p>
