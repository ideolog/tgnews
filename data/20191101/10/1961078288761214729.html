      <p>Memo is a minimalist, so we’ll keep this short. In the Video Op-Ed above, we trail Guillermo Piñeda Morales, a.k.a. Memo. He clocked a 2:28:42 at this year’s Boston Marathon. At age 46, that places him in the top 10 marathon runners for his age group globally. That’s very fast.</p>
      <p>The American fitness industry is worth $30 billion, but Memo’s not in on the trend. He won’t pop up in your Instagram #fitspo feed and you won’t get a glimpse of him at your gym. But if you have a resolution to run a marathon sometime, Memo will likely be whizzing past you. This Sunday, he’ll be running the New York City Marathon, bib #477. You can track him on the marathon’s <a href="https://www.nyrr.org/tcsnycmarathon/race-day/mobile-app">official app</a>. Share your photos, signs and well wishes using #WatchMemoRun on social media.</p>
      <p>What’s Memo’s trick? Well, you can find that in the video. But it’s far simpler and cheaper than anything else out there.</p>
