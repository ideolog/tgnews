      <p>The series is set on a parallel Earth to our own one, where individuals' souls exist outside their body as creatures known as daemons.</p>
      <p>With the first season adapting the events of the first novel in the series, Northern Lights (or The Golden Compass in the US), events will depict the orphan Lyra Belacqua searching for answers after her friends are kidnapped by "The Gobblers".</p>
      <p>At the same time, Lyra comes into the care of the mysterious Marisa Coulter who has a connection to Lyra's uncle, the controversial explorer Lord Asriel, and the all-powerful and extremely devout Magisterium.</p>
      <p>Gifted a sought-after device named an Alethiometer by the Master of Jordan College where she lives, Lyra searches for answers but comes up against powerful enemies and huge revelations.</p>
      <p>In a world with polar bear kings, powerful witches, and evil organisations seeking to rule not just one Earth but every Earth across parallel universes, it's sure to be a fantasy adventure to remember.</p>
      <h3>Will there be a second season?</h3>
      <p>Yes, HBO has already renewed the series for a second run.</p>
      <p>So expect at least the second novel A Subtle Knife to be adapted too.</p>
      <p>
        <b>His Dark Materials premieres in the UK on BBC One later this year.</b>
