      <p>A woman has fulfilled her dream of becoming a mother by giving birth to her first child at the age of 61.</p>
      <p>Nursing assistant Ana Maria Pontelo Moreira has given birth to a son in southern Brazil five years after starting IVF treatment.</p>
      <p>The mother told reporters she had been on the waiting list to adopt a child when she separated from her husband.</p>
      <p>She decided to undergo IVF treatment alone.</p>
      <p>She said: “In 2014 I started the fertilisation treatment because I didn’t have a partner.</p>

      <p>"The gestation was calm, I only had a problem with my spine but I did treatment with an orthopedist, pilates and physiotherapy. After that everything was calm.”</p>
      <p>Ms Moreira chose both the egg and sperm from banks which had genetic makeups compatible with her own.</p>
      <p>She added: “At 40 years old it isn’t possible to use your ovaries anymore, so I asked for a younger person, compatible with my blood type.</p>
      <p>"For the fertilisation to go well several exams were carried out.”</p>

      <p>The baby, named Ian, weighed 3.4 kilogrammes - about 7½lbs -  and was born via C-section at Hospital do Coracao Bella Suica in the city of Londrina.</p>
      <p>Ms Moreira added: “I hope my story is an inspiration for other people, it’s very rewarding. I know that there are older women who want to be mothers but they are scared. I fulfilled my dream.</p>
      <p>“The treatment wasn’t easy because I had to take hormones, it costs quite a lot and there were also lots of people who didn’t believe in it, I’m very happy.”</p>
