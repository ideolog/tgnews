      <h1>Crazy for Cookies: A taste of the Phuket cookie-themed suite decked out with fresh baked choco chip bar, dough-scented amenities</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T10:44:13+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 10:44</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/Coco%20Travel" target="_blank">Coco Travel</a></address>
      <p>Sure, you like cookies. But do you like them so much that you would plan a whole trip where the experience revolves around cookies? We’re talking not only sinking your teeth into free flow cookies, but also surrounding yourself with a cookie aesthetic and an overwhelming scent of cookies. Full. Cookie. Immersion.</p>
      <p>That’s the whole concept of the “world’s first cookie-themed suite”, an experiential stay at the DoubleTree by Hilton Phuket Banthai Resort.</p>
      <p>DoubleTree by Hilton has really leaned in hard to its cookie branding — their whole thing is warm, freshly baked cookies upon check-in. They’ve been doing it since the 1980s and even <a href="https://newsroom.hilton.com/doubletree/news/qa-with-the-doubletree-by-hilton-chief-cookie-officer-how-to-celebrate-national-cookie-day">have a chief cookie executive officer</a> (COO).</p>
      <p>Anyway, enough cookie history, and back to Phuket.</p>
      <p>The whole reason for this cookie-themed suite is to mark (or rather, market) the launch of the hotel’s Phuket location which opened on Sept. 5 of this year. The cookie suite is just a short-term promotional stunt that will live on until Dec. 31, 2019.</p>
      <p>A look at the photos of the cookie suite are surprisingly more **tasteful** (<i>bada-bing</i>) than we would’ve expected, in so much as that we were expecting a more kitschy setup from anything with such a strong theme.</p>

      <p>A vacation in this suite comes with a bar of gooey cookies, cookie bathrobes and plushies, and a beach kit with a custom cookie beach umbrella and towels, we’re told.</p>
      <p>There’s also cookie-scented candles and body-scrubs — just so you can really inhale the sweet cookie aroma with every move.</p>
      <p>The 3D2N package, ranges from THB7500 to THB10,000 (US$249 to US$332).</p>

        <figcaption>Yes, that’s cookie-scented body scrub. <i>Photo courtesy of DoubleTree by Hilton Phuket Banthai Resort.</i></figcaption>

      <p>What intrigues us perhaps the most of all though are the Pad Thai and Coconut-flavored cookies that are unique to the Phuket property.</p>
      <p>Personally, we do love our cookies but we’re not about to fly to Phuket just for a full-on cookie immersion. However, if you happen to be planning a trip to Phuket before the year’s end and make it to the cookie suite, please let us know in the comments how those novelty cookies taste.</p>
