      <h1>Plymouth Argyle injury update on midfield duo Jose Baxter and Conor Grant</h1>
      <h2>Pilgrims' boss Ryan Lowe has spoken about the recoveries of both players</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T10:19:53+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 10:19</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Errington</a></address>
      <p>Midfield duo Jose Baxter and Conor Grant continue to be ruled out of action for Plymouth Argyle.</p>
      <p>Manager Ryan Lowe has confirmed that neither of them will be fit <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/all-about/plymouth-argyle">for the League Two game against Grimsby Town at Home Park</a> on Saturday.</p>
      <p>However, the pair are getting close to being available after calf and thigh injuries respectively, and so his striker Dom Telford following his absence due to a hamstring problem.</p>
      <p>Lowe said: “They (Baxter and Grant) are probably a week away I would say. They are on grass-based running now, grass-based work.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know who’s going to come first, whether it will be Conor or Jose.</p>
      <p>“Dom is not far either. So, if you want an answer, I think it will be Dom, Conor and then Jose maybe.”</p>
      <p>After the game against Grimsby the Pilgrims will have a fortnight break from league action.</p>
      <p>That is because they will be away to Keith Hill’s League One outfit Bolton Wanderers in the FA Cup first round next Saturday.</p>
      <p>That tie could be a chance to get Telford, and possibly one or both of Baxter and Grant some game-time.</p>
      <p>Grant has missed the last five matches after he was injured in the 3-0 Leasing.com Trophy win at Swindon Town on October 8.</p>
      <p>Baxter originally hurt his calf in the 2-2 league draw at Crawley Town on September 17 and had a spell out of the side.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old did return to play as a substitute in the 1-1 league draw away to Swindon almost a month later.</p>
      <p>However, Baxter has not featured for the Pilgrims in the four games since then because of continuing soreness.</p>
