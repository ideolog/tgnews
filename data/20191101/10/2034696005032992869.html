      <p>The emo icons have <a href="https://www.nme.com/blogs/heres-all-the-evidence-of-that-mooted-my-chemical-romance-reunion-2508651">long been rumoured for a reunion</a> since <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/my-chemical-romance-12-1229324">their split in 2013</a>. Earlier this year, rumours of a comeback emerged when <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/joe-jonas-appears-to-have-leaked-my-chemical-romance-reunion-2506618-2506618">Joe Jonas claimed that MCR had been rehearsing in a studio next to them</a> in New York. <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/chemical-romances-frank-iero-responds-joe-jonas-reunion-claim-2523832">Guitarist Frank Iero then denied the claims</a>, but said that “anything is possible” with regards to them reforming.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/my-chemical-romance-reunion-tour-announcement-rumours-2019-2020-2563164">Last night (October 31), the band announced that they will perform a comeback show</a> at Los Angeles’ Shrine Expo Hall on Friday December 20. Tickets are on sale from 12pm Pacific Time tomorrow and will <a href="https://www.axs.com/events/385849/my-chemical-romance-tickets">be available here</a>.

      <p>The band released four albums together before they split. Anticipation grew around a reunion with the recent 15th and 13th anniversary of ‘<a href="https://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-blogs/an-obituary-for-my-chemical-romance-771314">Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge</a>‘ and ‘<a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/reviews-my-chemical-romance-8050">The Black Parade</a>‘, respectively. As well as the hope for more world tour dates and perhaps 2020 festival shows, fans are now speculating as to whether the band will release new material – with the follow up to to <a href="https://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-blogs/my-chemical-romance-danger-days-first-listen-782842">2010’s acclaimed ‘Danger Days…’</a></p>

      <p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/my-chemical-romance-gerard-way-opens-safety-writing-character-black-parade-2563195#I5vEaeVdUcYzh0VA.99">Way spoke about how writing in character for ‘The Black Parade’ helped him to feel “safe.”</a></p>
      <p>Speaking on the <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/1000455235092/id1481628144?i=1000455235092"><i>Carry the Fire</i> podcast</a>, Way said that writing in character on the band’s third, full-length album was “fun” and had been inspired by <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/david-bowie">David Bowie</a>‘s use of alter-egos and different personas.</p>
      <p>Way explained: “I think there’s a bit of safety that comes with being a character. Obviously, I was looking up to my heroes when I was constructing that. I was looking at David Bowie, especially around ‘The Black Parade’.</p>
      <p>“Early ‘Black Parade’ stuff was basically: ‘What if death had a rock band?’ and it obviously changed from that and we all became death in a way, the whole band.”</p>
