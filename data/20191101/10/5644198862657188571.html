      <p>Mr Mohan took top prize in the Story of the Year category for his captivating account of footballer <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/sport/singapore-football-ns-seagames-lionel-tan-11602828">Lionel Tan's decision to interrupt his National Service</a> stint to fight for a spot on the Under-22 national side going to the 2019 SEA Games.In the story, Mr Mohan wrote of how Mr Tan juggled his National Service demands as he passionately pursued his dream of winning a place in the Under-22 squad going to the Philippines, after missing out on playing action at the 2017 Sea Games in Malaysia.</p>

      <p>"I felt that Lionel’s story was one worth telling. Representing the nation clearly mattered to him - whether it be donning NS green or Singapore red," said Mr Mohan. </p>
      <p>"His display of remarkable discipline and character really struck me and was one which I hoped to highlight through my feature."</p>
      <p>He added: "Sports stories often run the risk of being too results-orientated. I wanted this piece to underscore that beyond the glitz and the glamour of winning, sportsmen put in an incredible amount of effort and that deserves attention."</p>
      <p>Mr Tan, 22, was last month named in coach Fandi Ahmad’s 23-man squad for a training camp in Japan, ahead of the SEA Games in the Philippines.</p>
