      <p>The National Emergency Operations Centre says it had more than 670 calls overnight, an increase on last Halloween.</p>
      <p>The emergency calls came in between 7pm yesterday and 7am this morning.</p>
      <p>In Dublin, the fire brigade dealt with 229 calls - 156 of them were Halloween related.</p>
      <p>There were attacks on crews, including fireworks being used to intimidate staff, however no one was injured.</p>
      <p>"There was an increase in calls from people who over-indulged in the Halloween festivities, there were trips and falls," said Richard Gleeson of the National Emergency Centre.</p>
      <p>"There was more incidents relating to the Halloween festivities but we also had the normal calls - the medical and traumatic emergencies - that we would normally get as well."</p>
      <p>Dublin Fire Brigade’s assistant chief officer, Greg O’Dwyer, has said that organised community activities have led to a reduction in the number of anti-social incidents on Halloween night.</p>
      <p>Year-on-year there has been a “slight” decrease in the number of fire calls and ambulance related activities he told RTÉ radio’s Morning Ireland.</p>

      <p>This reduction is down to the great work of local authorities and community groups, he said.</p>
      <p>Council staff had managed to clear up considerable amounts of stock piled bonfire material in advance while organised events offered families alternatives to illegal bonfires.</p>
      <p>“People really don’t need illegal bonfires now there is some place they can come and stay safe.”</p>
      <p>On Thursday night and Friday morning between the hours of 4pm and 6am, Dublin Fire Brigade responded to 230 fire related calls and 298 ambulance related activities.</p>
      <p>Overall there were 698 calls in 24 hours which was down from over 700 last year.</p>
      <p>While it had been a busy night, there had been no injuries to members of the public or members of the fire brigade, he said.</p>
      <p>The policy was to only tackle bonfires that were likely to cause damage to property or the public or a danger from fumes.</p>
      <p>“With some bonfires it was more prudent to stay back and observe.”</p>
