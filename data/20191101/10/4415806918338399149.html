      <p>The number of people in emergency accommodation increased again in September, with almost 10,400 adults and children experiencing homelessness.</p>
      <p>Department of Housing figures released yesterday show 10,397 people, including 6,524 adults and 3,873 children, accessed emergency accommodation in September.</p>
      <p>The homelessness total passed the 10,000 mark for the first time in March this year.</p>
      <p>Among adults, the biggest proportion of people accessing emergency accommodation was those aged between 25 and 44.</p>

      <p>There were also almost 1,000 more men than women who were homeless.</p>
      <p>The figures show there were 1,756 families experiencing homelessness last month.</p>
      <p>Some 76% of people accessed emergency accommodation in Dublin, followed by Cork, Galway, Limerick and Kildare.</p>
      <p>Anthony Flynn, CEO of homelessness charity Inner City Helping Homeless, called on Housing Minister Eoghan Murphy to consider his position and step down in light of the figures.</p>
      <p>“Further increases in the number of families, children and adults that are now homeless in the State have made the Minister’s position untenable. He needs to leave his post as the relentless persistence in expecting the private markets to resolve the homeless crisis have clearly failed,” he said.</p>

      <p>Wayne Stanley, national spokesman for the homelessness charity Simon Communities, said the figures do not capture the full extent of homelessness in Ireland because rough sleepers, those in squats, people in direct provision and women’s shelters are not included.</p>
      <p>He said it is “crucial that we remind ourselves that this is not normal”.</p>
      <p>Mr Stanley said: “Homelessness is not normal and as a society we long ago set out that it should not be acceptable.”</p>
      <p>He criticised the Government’s approach to solving the homelessness crisis and said it is not working.</p>
      <p>“The current programme cannot be allowed to drift on as if it was succeeding,” he said.</p>
      <p>“To move forward, the Government has to accept the failings of Rebuilding Ireland to provide affordable and secure housing across the country, particularly one and two-bed units, and act to improve levels of availability of suitable and secure accommodation for those currently experiencing homelessness.”</p>
      <p>Focus Ireland director of advocacy Mike Allen said the figures show that the problem “cannot be solved unless the Government moves to stop families being evicted from their homes by landlords who wish to sell up”.</p>
