      <h1>Man Utd dealt triple injury blow with Marcus Rashford a doubt for Bournemouth</h1>
      <h2>Marcus Rashford, Harry Maguire and Victor Lindelof could all miss Saturday's clash on the south coast</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T10:02:36+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 10:02</time> by <a rel="author">David McDonnell, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/david-mcdonnell/</a></address>
      <p>Marcus Rashford is a doubt for Manchester United's trip to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/afc-bournemouth">Bournemouth</a> on Saturday, along with Harry Maguire and Victor Lindelof.</p>
      <p>Rashford, United's match-winner in Wednesday's 2-1 Carabao Cup win at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> with a spectacular 35-yard free-kick, came off late on at Stamford Bridge with a knee injury.</p>
      <p>The England striker will be assessed by United's medical staff today, along with Maguire and Lindelof, before a decision is made on whether they can travel to Bournemouth.</p>
      <p>Rashford is in superb form at the moment, with four goals in his last four games for United, taking his tally to eight already for the season – just five short of his best career tally.</p>
      <p>“It's still early,” said Solskajer. “Hopefully we can get them back on the pitch tomorrow, they had some treatment yesterday, a little more treatment today, light session but I can't exactly tell you.</p>

      <p>“Since Anthony [Martial] has come back, Marcus has blossomed.</p>
      <p>“He's probably happier facing goal, being direct, driving at people, taking players on rather than being a target man with his back to goal.</p>
      <p>“But Marcus wants to master all the skills, he's only just turned 22, so maybe playing as a two with Anthony, maybe as a three against Norwich or wide, like we did against Chelsea.</p>
      <p>“There are different ways of playing and it was important he stepped up for that penalty against Chelsea.”</p>
      <p>United are enjoying a revival, with three wins in a row on the road, with Solskjaer claiming the progress he has seen on the training pitch, despite poor results early on, is starting to pay off.</p>

      <p>“It's hard to evaluate after just 10 league games and cup games,” said Solskjaer.</p>
      <p>“But we've played really well at times, developed a team spirit, an identity, more intensity and aggression in the team and suffered a bit from injuries.</p>
      <p>“But that's football, sometimes you get luck of the dice. The game on Wednesday was decided by an unbelievable strike by Marcus.</p>
      <p>“Against Partizan we defended really well, some great last ditch defending there, and Norwich was a good game.</p>

      <p>“The confidence is getting better, getting players back from injury helps. In football it's not every far from failure to success or other way round.</p>
      <p>“The international break came at a great time for us.</p>
      <p>“We prepared for the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> game and when you get a decent performance and result against the league leaders, it gives you a bit more energy.</p>
      <p>“From then on the boys were happy with the work we did, the change of system helped and the coaches have done a great job.</p>

      <p>“Every game is a new opportunity to show what you can do and that's part of being here.</p>
      <p>“I didn't play every game. Every game I played was a chance to show the manager I should play the next one and hopefully these boys feel like that.”</p>
