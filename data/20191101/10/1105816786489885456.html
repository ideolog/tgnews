      <h1>Nintendo to begin testing Mario Kart Tour multiplayer</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T10:29:52+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 10:29</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/77/reuters/" target="_blank">Reuters</a></address>
      <p><b>TOKYO: </b>Nintendo said on Friday it would begin testing a multiplayer option for its Mario Kart Tour mobile game in December, a step towards the full multiplayer mode demanded by players and seen as essential to boosting the title’s revenues.</p>
      <p>A major test of Nintendo’s shift to mobile, Mario Kart Tour currently lacks the option to race against friends, leaving the game without a key element that has helped make it one of Nintendo’s longest-running franchises.</p>
      <p>Nintendo’s shares jumped almost 7 per cent on Friday, a day after the Japanese gaming company also reported a strong demand for a low-cost version of its hybrid home-portable Switch console.</p>
      <p>Nintendo said on Thursday it sold almost 2 million units of its handheld-only Switch Lite device in the 10 days after its September launch, with the company’s operating profit doubling in the second quarter.</p>

      <p>Switch Lite is being purchased by many gamers as a second device and is also gaining traction among female players, Nintendo said, helping expand the device’s mainstream appeal beyond a hardcore gaming contingent.</p>
      <p>As Nintendo bolsters its hardware and software lineup ahead of the year-end holiday shopping season, the latest high profile Switch release, Luigi’s Mansion 3, went on sale on Thursday to a positive critical reception.</p>

      <p>Nintendo is not the only gaming company looking to mobile to bolster revenues, with Konami Holdings Corp on Thursday launching a mobile version of its long running LovePlus dating sim series in Japan.</p>
      <p>Konami’s shares were trading up 4.2 per cent at the midday break in Tokyo. Nintendo’s shares were up 5.9 per cent, with the benchmark index down 0.4 per cent.</p>
