      <h1>Conte makes Barça's Arturo Vidal his No.1 objective for Inter's midfield</h1>
      <h2>The two worked together at Juventus and maintain a great relationship to this day</h2>

      <p>Inter Milan coach Antonio Conte is very interested in two FC Barcelona players: Arturo Vidal and Ivan Rakitic. But according to La Gazzetta dello Sport on Friday, the No.1 objective in January is the Chilean, not the Croatian.</p>
      <p>The ex-Chelsea boss wants to strengthen his squad in the winter and Vidal, who he coached at Juventus, fits the profile he wants. a physical, all-action midfielder who has character and can contribute in the final third. Conte is also after a wing-back who can play on either flank (Darmian is the preference) and a forward with similar characteristics to Romelu Lukaku.</p>
      <p>However, Inter are not ready to pay big fees and in principle will look for loan deals with an option to buy. In this sense, the option of including midfielder Sensi in some way -- he is liked by Barcelona -- could ease negotiations.</p>
      <p>It's still early, though, to say if Conte's wish will become a reality. Vidal is Ernesto Valverde's fourth-choice central midfielder at Barça and his role in the team continues to grow, as could be seen against Real Valladolid when he scored via a brilliant Lionel Messi assist.</p>
