      <p>TORONTO – A 19-year-old man and a 15-year-old girl are now facing a slew of charges, including attempted murder, after a stabbing at a "rowdy" Halloween party in The Annex neighbourhood overnight left multiple people injured.</p>
      <p>Police said they were called to a home on Madison Avenue, north of Bloor Street West, around 11:30 p.m. on Thursday night after a fight broke out.</p>
      <p>According to investigators, the man and the girl were denied entry into a private party being held inside the home.</p>
      <p>Police allege that the pair then forced their way in, "slashing and stabbing" people inside, as well as outside as they were leaving.</p>

      <p>Mayor John Tory commented on the incident Friday morning, saying the recent violence in Toronto has left him "disturbed".</p>
      <p>"I am perplexed by the fact people seem to be prepared to engage in random acts of violence in the city," Tory said.</p>
