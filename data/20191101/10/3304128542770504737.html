      <p>Police in Rwanda are holding eight Kenyans who were recently arrested for allegedly attempting to hack Equity Bank in the country.</p>
      <p>The suspects were arrested alongside three Rwandese and one Ugandan by the Rwanda Investigation Bureau (RIB).</p>
      <p>“This group was arrested while in the process of hacking into the bank system to steal money from clients’ accounts,” RIB said on Twitter.</p>
      <p>RIB said the group fled to Rwanda after successfully defrauding Equity Bank in Kenya and Rwanda.</p>
      <p>The suspects were probed and the case file has been submitted to the state prosecution for further action.</p>

      <p>“The case file was compiled and submitted to the  @ProsecutionRw for further management, ” RIB added.</p>

      <p>The indent comes just a month after another Kenyan was condemned to two years in prison for defrauding Rwandans.</p>
      <p>The man identified as Charles Kinuthia was found guilty of soliciting money from hundreds of Rwandans to attend his “wealth conference” in the capital in May.</p>

      <p>“Although Kinuthia pleaded not guilty, he accepted that he was the one who sent messages inviting people to attend the conference,” the court said.</p>
      <p>Cases of Equity Bank customers losing money in their accounts have been on the rise in the recent past.</p>
      <p>Last month detectives from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) launched a probe into an incident where a granny was defrauded Ksh2 million.</p>
      <p>The 73-year-old woman identified as Faith Wanjiku had her monies siphoned in a series of transactions via the Eazzy Pay app.</p>
      <p>Three suspects were arrested and charged with fraud.</p>
