      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T10:23:38+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 10:23</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/8754/our-correspondent-6/" target="_blank">​ Our Correspondent</a></address>
      <p>The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) on Friday said a new cyclonic storm, named ‘Maha’, has formed in the Arabian Sea.</p>
      <p>The cyclone is approximately 1,140 kilometres from Karachi with wind speeds between 90 and 110 kilometres per hour.</p>
      <p>‘Maha’ is currently moving in a northwesterly direction. However, the met department said the coastline of Pakistan is not threatened by the storm.</p>
      <p>No rain is expected in Karachi as per weather forecasts.</p>
      <p>The Met Office also said that the previous storm, ‘Kyarr’, had already lost its intensity over the Arabian Sea before ‘Maha’ formed.</p>
      <p>“Cyclone Kyarr will weaken further until it dies down without hitting any coastal areas,” said Chief Meteorologist Sardar Sarfaraz.</p>
