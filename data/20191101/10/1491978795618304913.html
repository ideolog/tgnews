        <i>Member of religious council is publicly whipped in conservative Aceh region</i>
      </p>
      <p>An Indonesian man working for an organisation that helped draft strict religious laws has been publicly whipped himself after he was caught having an affair with a married woman.</p>
      <p>Flogging is a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/17/aceh-flogs-13-young-people-for-breaking-islamic-laws-sharia-intimacy-indonesian-province">common punishment</a> for a range of offences in the deeply conservative Aceh region on Sumatra island, including adultery, drinking alcohol, and having <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/27/the-public-flogging-of-two-gay-men-and-what-it-says-about-indonesias-future">gay or pre</a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/27/the-public-flogging-of-two-gay-men-and-what-it-says-about-indonesias-future">marital sex</a>.</p>
      <p>Aceh is the only region in the world’s biggest Muslim-majority nation that imposes Islamic law, part of a 2005 autonomy deal with the central government that ended a decades-long separatist insurgency.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, a masked religious officer lashed Mukhlis, an Aceh Ulema Council (MPU) member, 28 times on the back after he was caught with a married woman last month.</p>
      <p>Mukhlis, who like many Indonesians goes by one name, grimaced and flinched during the punishment in the provincial capital, Banda Aceh. The woman was then flogged with a rattan cane 23 times.</p>
      <p>The organisation for which Mukhlis works advised the local government and legislature on drafting and implementing Aceh’s religious law, including public flogging.</p>
      <p>It was not immediately clear what he did for the agency.</p>
      <p>The council made headlines this summer when it criticised plans to form a national women’s football league because Aceh did not have a special stadium where only female players, match officials and spectators would be present.</p>
      <p>In June, it issued a fatwa, or religious edict, against the online game PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds (PUBG), saying it insulted Islam and made addicted players violent.</p>
      <p>Flogging a council member underlined the commitment to enforcing Islamic law, said the Aceh Besar deputy regent, Husaini Wahab.</p>
      <p>“No matter who you are … if you violate [Islamic] law you will be whipped,” he told reporters after the punishment.</p>
      <p>Mukhlis would probably be sacked under his employer’s moral code, Wahab added.</p>
      <p>Also on Thursday, a female university student was flogged a dozen times after she was caught spending the night in a boarding house with a man, who escaped punishment because he was underage.</p>
      <p>Dozens of onlookers watched the floggings, with some recording them on their mobile phones. “I was just curious to see how it was carried out,” said one spectator, Robbi.</p>
      <p>In July, three people were each flogged 100 times for having premarital sex, while last year two men caught having sex with underaged girls were also whipped 100 times.</p>
      <p>Rights groups have criticised public caning as a cruel and inhuman punishment, and Indonesia’s president, Joko Widodo, has called for it to end. But the practice has wide support among Aceh’s mostly Muslim population.</p>
