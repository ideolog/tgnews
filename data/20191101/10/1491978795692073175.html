        <i>The winner of the Arthur C Clarke award on the influence of Mary Shelley, crying over Stephen King, and his unopened copies of Gormenghast</i>
      </p>
      <p><b>The book I am currently reading</b><br/><i>Chaos: Charles Manson, the CIA and the Secret History of the Sixties </i>by Tom O’Neill takes on the Tate-LaBianca murders from left field. Like anyone with a heartbeat in the 70s, this story haunted me, but O’Neill pulls together some threads that I knew nothing about.</p>
      <p><b>The book that changed my life</b><br/>There is no single book, but Seneca’s <i>Letters from a Stoic</i> and Maurice Rowdon’s <i>Leonardo Da Vinci</i> come close. I had an interesting childhood and these books helped me cope, Seneca by teaching me to control the experience of suffering, and Rowdon by showing me that weirdness can be a result of creativity (or that creative people can be weird). Both calmed me down.</p>
      <p><b>The book I wish I’d written</b><br/><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/aug/03/fiction"><i>Ocean Sea</i> by Alessandro Baricco</a>. Those weird, evocative sentences and unforgettable characters … it’s the kind of book I’d like to have written to demonstrate the purity of my feelings for a lover. She, of course, would reject me.</p>
      <aside>When I finished Moby-Dick I wanted to make a list of everybody who had recommended it and make them eat it</aside>
      <p><b>The book that</b><b> influenced my writing</b><br/><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/13/frankenstein-at-200-why-hasnt-mary-shelley-been-given-the-respect-she-deserves-">Mary Shelley’s <i>Frankenstein</i></a>. I read it as a teenager and the seething mess of nested narratives and charnel houses lodged itself in my imagination. I’ve read it more than any other book and hardly a day goes by when I don’t think of making corpses walk. Quite frankly Victor Frankenstein was a dick.</p>
      <p><b>The book I think is most overrated</b><br/><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jul/30/subversive-queer-and-terrifyingly-relevant-six-reasons-why-moby-dick-is-the-novel-for-our-times"><i>Moby-Dick</i> by Herman Melville</a>. With apologies to my US friends and my English teacher. This book didn’t just leave me cold. When I finished I wanted to make a list of everybody who had recommended it and make them eat it.</p>
      <p><b>The book that changed my mind</b><br/>I generally turned my nose up at fantasy until I read <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jul/28/robin-hobb-books-interview-assassins-fate">Robin Hobb’s <i>Assassin’s Apprentice</i>.</a></p>
      <p><b>The last book that made me cry</b><br/>It was also the first book that made me cry: <i>IT</i> by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/07/stephen-king-interview-the-institute">Stephen King</a>. There’s a scene in the middle that actually happened to me. No, not an evil clown-spider. A fight with bullies.</p>
      <p><b>The last book that made me laugh</b><br/><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jun/01/less-andrew-sean-greer-review"><i>Less</i> by Andrew Sean Greer</a>. What would you do to avoid a former lover’s wedding? Go on a world tour, of course. Absurd and heartbreaking.</p>
      <p><b>The book I couldn’t finish</b><br/><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/jan/13/is-james-joyce-ulysses-the-hardest-novel-to-finish"><i>Ulysses</i> by James Joyce</a>. Sorry, James. I tried. I even spent money on a special edition in order to force myself. My last attempt was five years ago and I stopped at page 52.</p>
      <p><b>The book I’m most ashamed not to have read</b><br/><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/aug/16/gormenghast-masterpiece-mervyn-peake"><i>Gormenghast</i> by Mervyn Peake</a>. I have two versions given to me as gifts. They remain unopened.</p>
      <p><b>My earliest reading memory</b><br/><i>Fantastic Four Annual #4</i> by Jack Kirby and Stan Lee. I was five. Young Human Torch versus older, wiser, WW II Human Torch. It was love at first sight.</p>
      <p><b>My comfort read</b><br/><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/jul/15/fiction.reviews"><i>House of Leaves</i> by Mark Z Danielewski</a>. I wrote a ghost story novelette once, and a reader commented that I was obviously influenced by this book. I had never heard of it, but I read it and kept going back, because it is lush and endless.</p>
      <p><b>The book I’d most like to be remembered for</b><br/>Too early to answer this, but I’m proud of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/oct/04/rosewater-tade-thompson-review"><i>Rosewater</i></a>.</p>
      <p>•<i> Rosewater won the Arthur C Clarke award in July 2019. The </i><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/the-rosewater-redemption-9780356511399.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article"><i>Rosewater Redemption</i></a><i> is published by Orbit.</i></p>
