        <b>Banksy, the England-based street artist known for his satirical and politically-charged stencil graffiti, remains the world’s most famous anonym despite decades of speculation. The freshly-published images shed little, if any, light on his identity but provide a rare glimpse into his work.</b>
      </p>
      <p>A series of photos purported to be of the elusive street artist Banksy have emerged online; however, his face is never revealed.<br/>Steve Lazarides, who was Banksy’s agent and photographer during his early years as an artist, has released the photos ahead of the publication of his book titled <i>Banksy Captured</i>, which documents their time working together.</p>
      <p>Banksy is seen from behind in some of his reputed photos, while others have his face concealed, one with a book and another with a plank of wood (click <a href="https://banksycaptured.com/collections/banksy">here</a> to view).</p>

      <p>“These images were from a period in time when we ran riot, tearing down the art establishment,” Lazarides wrote.</p>
      <p>Lazarides, now an art gallery owner, said in a press release that he had worked with Banksy “for 11 glorious years, during which time we broke every rule in the rule book, along with a fair few laws”.</p>
      <blockquote>“I hate the art world. I only became part of it because Banksy catapulted the movement into the stratosphere,” he added, calling their period together a “ride”.</blockquote>
      <p>Banksy is rumoured to hail from the city of Bristol in southwest England; he made his name with his trademark stencil paintings on buildings and walls, laced with satire and political commentary.</p>
      <p>Some of his best-known works include the mural ‘Girl with Balloon’, a framed copy of which was shred to pieces at an auction,  and ‘Devolved Parliament’ – a literal interpretation of the term depicting chimps sitting in the House of Commons.</p>

      <p>Banksy prefers to remain anonymous, which only fuels public interest in his persona. There is a widespread theory that Banksy is actually Robert Del Naja, the 54-year-old Bristol-born co-founder of the trip-hop band Massive Attack.</p>
      <p>A long-lost ITV News video interview with an English graffiti artist purported to be Banksy <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201907051076152745-interview-graffiti-artist-who-could-be-real-banksy/">was discovered in June</a> this year. It shows the artist, whose face is partially hidden by a cap and a pulled-up T-shirt, stencilling Banksy’s famous ‘Kill More’ graffiti on a wall.</p>
