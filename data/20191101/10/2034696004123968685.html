      <p>De Niro explains how he convinced long-time collaborator Joe Pesci to work on the film, despite having basically retired.</p>

      <p>Old friends: Al Pacino is reunited with Robert De Niro on screen in ‘The Irishman’.</p>
      <p>“I said: ‘Come on, we’re not going to do this ever again.’” De Niro remembers. “It was tough enough to get it done, to get the money to do it and everything.</p>
      <p>He continued, looking to the future of his work with Pacino, Scorsese and Pesci: “I don’t see us putting on a movie like this. I hope we do other films together, but like this? Not likely. This is it.”</p>
      <p>Pacino also speaks about his friendship with De Niro, saying: “We’re really close. We don’t see each other very much, but when we do, we found we shared certain things. In a way, I think we’ve helped each other throughout life.”</p>

      <p>In <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/movie/the-irishman-review-martin-scorsese-robert-de-niro">a four-star review of <i>The Irishman</i></a>, <i>NME</i>‘s Greg Wetherall said: “If this is to be Pesci, De Niro and Scorsese’s final fling together, then they couldn’t wish to end on a better note. The director’s 26th feature film is a meditative and classy offering. Hollywood’s old cronies are still the real deal – magnetic, riveting and unique. Let’s hope we see them again soon.”</p>
