      <p>FORT MYERS, Fla. -- A Fort Myers 7th grader has been arrested after reportedly making a bomb threat at his school.</p>
      <p>According to a Lee County Sheriff's Office report, the 12-year-old is charged with false report of a bomb.</p>
      <p>Authorities were tipped off to the threat at Oak Hammock Middle School via the FortifyFL app, and visited the boy's home. Detectives determined there were no explosives or firearms at the home, and that the boy did not have access to any explosives or firearms.</p>
      <p>It is suspected the boy made the threat as an act of revenge after reports he was involved in a physical altercation with a fellow student.</p>
      <p>Fox 4 does not identify minors under arrest unless they are being charged as an adult.</p>
