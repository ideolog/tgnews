      <h1>Aprilia RS660's new teaser video reveals exhaust note, official unveiling at EICMA 2019</h1>

      <p>The EICMA 2019 show that is scheduled to take place in the first week of November will have many exciting launches from numerous brands like BMW, Triumph, KTM and others. Among these motorcycle manufacturers will be Aprilia that's taking the Milan show as a platform to showcase its all-new RS660. The Italian motorcycle manufacturer has released a new teaser video that almost shows the motorcycle, but most importantly reveals the exhaust note of the half V4 660cc parallel-twin motor.</p>

      <p>While the RS660 itself is an amazing news, the bigger update was that Aprilia plans to target Asian markets with the production version of the 660 supersports bike. Yes, we in India are excited for it as well. The overall silhouette of the Aprilia RS660 does look like the showbike, however, there are tweaks in the design to accommodate the newly designed side panels and also the distinctive air wings do not come with air outlets positioned behind them as shown in the concept bike. The air winds have been designed in such a way that it functions as a complete unit and channelises air flow accordingly.</p>

      <p>Further, the LED strip has been given a miss but the overall headlight design remains unchanged. The side indicators should be a bolt-on on the fairing, as it's not seen on the rendering or on the concept bike. Also, the concept motorcycle was showcased with Öhlins fork and Brembo Stylema calipers which have been replaced by Sachs suspension and Brembo Monoblocks, similar to what is on offered on the <a href="http://overdrive.in/bikes/aprilia/rsv4/rr-v1159/">RSV4 RR</a>. This could be the regular or the standard version of the RS660. Aprilia might also churn out a pure-performance bred Factory machine like it offers the RR and Factory siblings of the RSV4. The wheel design has been changed to Y-spoke.</p>

      <p>Powering the Aprilia Concept 660 Supersports is an all-new parallel-twin engine that has been developed from taking the front half of the <a href="http://overdrive.in/bikes/aprilia/rsv4-m2/">Aprilia RSV4</a> 1100's unit. From the looks of it, it can be seen that the new engine is a complex and compact unit. In fact, the overall construction of the motorcycle is so compact that the engine acts as the stress member of the chassis. The rear swingarm has been pivoted inside the crankcase while the engine is positioned inside the twin-spar aluminium frame at the rear of the heads and also with the top of the rear of the crankcase. The right arm of the swingarm has a curved shape in order to allow the exhaust terminal to pass. The particular mounting of the shock absorber allows outstanding progression to be obtained without using linkage, thereby cutting down on weight and making it a cleaner package overall.</p>
