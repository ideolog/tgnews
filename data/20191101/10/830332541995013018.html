      <p>CHICAGO - A night of trick-or-treating ended with a 7-year-old girl critically injured after she was shot Thursday night in Chicago.</p>
      <p>The girl had been trick-or-treating with her family around 5:30 p.m., when a group of men chasing another man began firing, Chicago Police Department Sgt. Rocco Alioto told reporters Thursday night.</p>
      <p>The child was shot in the lower neck, police said, and is in critical condition at Stroger Hospital.</p>
      <p>Alioto said the child is "fighting for her life."</p>
      <p>"This is unacceptable. It's a 7-year-old girl that's trick-or-treating with her family out here and happens to get shot because a group of guys want to shoot at another male while there is a street full of kids trick-or-treating," Alioto said.</p>
      <p>A 31-year-old man was also shot in the incident. He is in stable condition after being transported to Mount Sinai Hospital with a gunshot wound to his left hand, police said.</p>
      <p>There is no relationship between the victims, police said.</p>
      <p>Alioto said police do not yet have a description for those involved and were canvassing the area.</p>
