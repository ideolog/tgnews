        <b>Nigel Farage says there needs to be "some kind of alliance" between the Tories and the Brexit Party for the upcoming election.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Reports have suggested Mr Farage's party would stand down hundreds of election candidates for December's poll to stop a split in the pro-Brexit vote.</p>
      <p>The Conservatives have consistently ruled out a formal pact with the party.</p>
      <p>It comes after President Donald Trump said Mr Farage and Boris Johnson should <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2019-50258139">team up as "an unstoppable force"</a>.</p>
      <p>The Brexit Party's launch for its official election campaign has just begun and Mr Farage is expected to announce the party's strategy.</p>
      <p>Chairman of the party, Richard Tice, said: "We have a major role to play in the outcome of this general election."</p>
      <p>The Brexit Party's MEP for the North West of England, Claire Fox, said she was "really excited by this election because voters can take centre stage again".</p>
      <p>In August, <a href="https://twitter.com/nigel_farage/status/1166263226771881984">Mr Farage tweeted</a> the party had "635 men and women from all walks of life who are prepared to fight a general election".</p>
      <p>And in September, the party issued a list of 409 candidates standing in England, Scotland and Wales.</p>

      <p>Mr Farage has been critical of Mr Johnson's failure to deliver on his promise that the UK would leave the EU on 31 October.</p>
      <p>But earlier this week, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/10/30/brexit-party-could-help-tories-general-election-not-fighting/">the Telegraph reported</a> the Brexit Party was considering removing candidates to help the Conservatives win a majority of seats in 12 December's election to ensure the UK leaves the EU.</p>
      <p>Instead, it said, they would focus their energies on Labour-held seats which voted Leave in the 2016 EU referendum.</p>
      <p>Mr Farage called the reports "idle speculation".</p>
      <p>But speaking about his party's launch on Friday morning, he told LBC radio: "Most of what I will be saying will be about Boris' deal and the need, in my view, for some kind of alliance."</p>
      <p>He refused to comment on whether the Brexit Party would be fielding "20 or 200 candidates".</p>
      <h3>Remain pacts</h3>
      <p>On the other side of the Brexit debate, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-50234641">Remain-supporting parties have been negotiating electoral pacts in certain constituencies.</a></p>
      <p>The potential agreements would see the Liberal Democrats, Greens and Plaid Cymru stand aside for each other to ensure the election of as many MPs who back a second Brexit referendum as possible.</p>
      <p>Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley said it was "no secret" that the his party was "talking to the Lib Dems and Plaid" but "nothing has been finalised".</p>
