      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/DemiMoore">Demi Moore</a>’s daughters have opened up about their mother’s battle with drug and alcohol <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Addiction">addiction</a>.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, a preview of the latest episode of <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/jada-pinkett-smith">Jada Pinkett Smith</a>’s <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Facebook">Facebook</a> Watch show, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/redtabletalk/"><i>Red Table Talk</i></a>, was posted on the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/SocialMedia">social media</a> site.</p>
      <p>The upcoming episode, which is due to air on Monday, will see Moore discuss her past <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/substance-abuse">substance abuse</a> issues alongside two of her daughters, Rumer and Tallulah Willis.</p>
      <p>Moore’s third daughter with ex-husband <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/BruceWillis">Bruce Willis</a>, Scout, does not appear in the teaser.</p>
      <p>The 56-year-old recently documented her struggle with addiction in her new memoir, <i>Inside Out</i>, which chronicles her drug habit during her twenties before she entered rehab.</p>
      <p>The <i>Ghost</i> actor managed to stay sober for nearly 20 years. However, following her split from third husband <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/AshtonKutcher">Ashton Kutcher</a> in 2012, Moore relapsed, turning to alcohol and Vicodin.</p>
      <p>In the short clip, Tallulah details how the family coped with their mother’s relapse, revealing that it drove a wedge between them. </p>
      <p>“It was like the sun went down and like a monster came,” Tallulah said.</p>
      <p>“I remember there’s just the anxiety that would come up in my body when I could sense that her eyes were shutting a little bit more, the way she was speaking. Or she would be a lot more affectionate with me if she wasn’t sober.”</p>
      <p>Rumer nodded in agreement as her sister spoke before describing their mother’s behaviour during this time as “jarring”.</p>
      <p>Tallulah added that she would often get “upset” at Moore when she was intoxicated and would find herself speaking to her mother “like a child.”</p>
      <p>“It was not the mum that we had grown up with,” the 25-year-old continued.</p>

      <p>In her memoir, the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Hollywood">Hollywood</a> actor also recalled how she suffered from <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/eating-disorder">disordered eating</a> and an obsession with exercise.</p>
      <p>Moore revealed that the fixation began when she was training for the role of a naval lawyer in the movie <i>A Few Good Men</i>, shortly after giving birth to her third child. </p>
      <p>“I didn’t feel like I could stop exercising,” Moore wrote in the book. </p>

      <p>“It was my job to fit into that unforgiving military uniform I’d be wearing in two months in <i>A Few Good Men</i>. Getting in shape for that movie launched the obsession with working out that would consume me over the next five years. I never dared let up.” </p>
      <p>Despite learning from her doctors at the time that she wasn’t producing enough fat in her breast milk to sustain her daughter, Moore found herself unable to stop working out.</p>

      <p>The actor added that her strict exercise routine came to an end after she had an “epiphany in the shower one day”.</p>
      <p>“I just need to be my natural size,” she wrote.</p>
