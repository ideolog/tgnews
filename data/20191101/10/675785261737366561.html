      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T10:26:42+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 10:26</time> by <a rel="author">Will Twigger, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/will-twigger/</a></address>
      <p>US musical icon <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/beyonce">Beyoncé</a> is filming for her new video in south London.</p>
      <p>Ahead of the release of her track Brown Skin Girl, the superstar's out and about in a number of Catford and Thamesmead estates.</p>
      <p>The casting team for the video wants "black and brown people of different cultures, nationalities, ethnicities, genders and ages" for the hitmaker's latest offering.</p>
      <p>Members of Beyoncé's huge team were spotted by HM Prison Thameside yesterday.</p>
      <p>A source told the MailOnline that the 38-year-old is particularly passionate about getting the video to match the true message and meaning of the record.</p>
      <p>"Beyoncé wants this video to truly represent the essence of the song," the source said.</p>
      <p>"She may refer to Naomi Campbell and Lupita Nyong'o in the track but she was keen to have normal people step forward and tell their stories.</p>

      <p>"Her casting team called for all different family structures to apply including 'blended, single parent, queer and adopted.'</p>
      <p>"Trained actors and dancers were also wanted but the main focus is on showcasing a variety of body shapes and ages, from as young as six months to the elderly.</p>
      <p>"Shooting started today in London but as yet Beyoncé is only going to star in the side of the film recorded in America."</p>

      <p>It's especially important for the singer to get this one right as it marks a collaboration not just with Saint Jhn and Wizkid, but her daughter Blue Ivy.</p>
      <p>The seven-year-old will be flexing her vocal chords on the song, with the mother-daughter team effort directed by Peckham's own Jenn Nkiru.</p>
      <p>She shares Blue Ivy with rapping megastar <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jay-z">Jay-Z</a> , who she's been married to for over a decade.</p>
      <p>Bey's been kept busy over the past year with her role in Disney's remake of The Lion King.</p>
      <p>She took on the iconic role of Nala, and even released an album - Lion King: The Gift - alongside her voice acting.</p>
