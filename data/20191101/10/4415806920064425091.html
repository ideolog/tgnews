      <p>Essex Police have revealed that they have spoken by telephone to fugitive Ronan Hughes who they want to question over the deaths of 39 people found in the back of a lorry in Essex.</p>
      <p>Ronan Hughes, and his brother Christopher, 34, both from Co Armagh were named earlier this week as people the police wanted to speak to in connection with the deaths.</p>
      <p>Officer Daniel Stoten made an appeal for the pair to hand themselves in.</p>
      <p>Maurice Robinson, 25, has already appeared before an Essex court accused of the manslaughter of the 39 migrants.</p>
      <p>Speaking yesterday, Detective Chief Superintendent Stuart Hooper, who is leading the investigation, said: “Finding and speaking to the Hughes brothers is crucial to our investigation.</p>
      <p>“At this time we believe they are in Northern Ireland but they also have links to the Irish Republic."</p>
