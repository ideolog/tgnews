      <h1>How to get the best Apple TV+ launch deals</h1>
      <h2>It might be worth waiting before starting your free trial.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T10:58:00+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 10:58</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.engadget.com/editors/igor-bonifacic" target="_blank">Igor Bonifacic</a></address>
      <p>After months of leadup, Apple's video streaming service, TV+, is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/01/apple-tv-launches-today/">ready to launch</a>. With this being Apple's first foray into original video content, we've detailed the ways you can get access to the platform without paying the full $5 per month right away.</p>
      <p>To start, anyone that signs up for Apple TV+ will receive a free seven-day trial. The one thing to keep in mind with today's launch is that it's probably not worth subscribing to Apple TV+ just yet. Reviews of the initial lineup <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/10/28/apple-tv-plus-review-roundup/">haven't been great</a>, and not all the episodes from each series are available to watch. You'll get a lot more out of the seven-day trial if you wait.</p>
      <p>Another way to get Apple TV+ for free is to buy a new Apple device. If you purchase a new iPhone, iPad, Mac or Apple TV, you get a free one-year subscription. This offer has been available since Apple <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/10/apple-tv-plus-launch/">announced it on September 10th</a>, the same day the company unveiled the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro. When you launch the Apple TV app on your new device, you'll see a prompt to start your trial. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/01/apple-tv-4k-sale-att/">AT&amp;T is currently selling the Apple TV for $90</a> -- down from $179 -- so if you've been thinking about buying the set-top box, that's one way you can get both the device and Apple TV+ for relatively little money.</p>
      <p>Students, meanwhile, get free access to the service if they're a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/10/30/apple-tv-plus-music-student-bundle/">current Apple Music subscriber</a>. If you're in college or university but don't subscribe to Apple's music streaming service, you can still take advantage of the offer, though only for a "limited-time." It's also worth pointing out that Apple TV+ won't be free once you graduate. You'll also lose access if you cancel your Apple Music subscription at any time.</p>
      <p>Last but not least, if you happen to subscribe to <a href="https://www.emmys.com/emmy-magazine"><i>Emmy</i> magazine</a>, you'll have received a three-month trial voucher <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/10/14/apple-tv-three-month-free-trial/">inside the latest issue</a>.</p>
      <p>Again, it's worth stressing that when it comes to Apple TV+, being patient will likely go a long way. Apple has interesting <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/10/11/masters-of-the-air-apple-tv-plus/">content in the pipeline</a>, and you'll be to watch most shows in their entirety.</p>
