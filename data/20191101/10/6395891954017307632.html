      <p><b>LONDONÂ (AP)</b> - The Latest on Britain's upcoming election and Brexit (all times local):</p>
      <p>10:15 a.m.:</p>
      <p>Denmark's immigration minister says the number of British citizens seeking Danish citizenship has more than tripled compared with 2017, the year after Britain voted to leave the European Union.</p>
      <p>Mattias Tesfaye says that, so far in 2019, 489 British citizens have applied to obtain dual nationality. For the whole of 2017, 134 Britons applied.</p>
      <p>Tesfaye says he believes "the increase is due to Brexit." The 489 Britons are among a total of 3,566 foreigners who have sought naturalization in Denmark so far this year.</p>
      <p>Citizenship applications need approval from parliament, which considers them twice a year.</p>

      <p>British euroskeptic politician Nigel Farage is launching his party's election campaign, a day after U.S. President Donald Trump urged him to make an electoral pact with Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservatives.</p>
      <p>Farage's Brexit Party rejects Johnson's divorce deal with the European Union and wants to leave the bloc with no agreement on future relations.</p>
      <p>Farage, who played a key role in the campaign for Britain to leave the EU, hasn't revealed whether his party will contest all 650 House of Commons seats up for grabs, or pick a few where it has a chance of winning.</p>
      <p>Running in a small number of seats would help the Conservatives, who are vying with Farage for the support of Brexit-backing voters.</p>
      <p>Farage said Friday there's a need for "some kind of Brexit alliance."</p>
