      <h1>Mehwish Hayat condemns #Tezgam train inferno</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T10:01:52+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 10:01</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/5607/entertainment-desk/" target="_blank">Entertainment Desk</a></address>
      <p>At least 74 lives were snuffed out when a blaze ignited by a cooking gas cylinder blast swept through a passenger train which was en route to Rawalpindi from Karachi on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The cylinder brought by some passengers said to be members of Tableeghi Jamaat on-board Tezgam Express exploded when the train was chugging past Liaquatpur city in the southern Punjab district of Rahim Yar Khan.</p>
      <p>Many took to Twitter to express condolences and condemn the incident. Mehwish Hayat also shared her thoughts.</p>
      <p>“Prayers and condolences for all those who lost their lives in the Tezgam incident. Made even more tragic by the fact that it could’ve been prevented if adequate checks on baggage had been in place,” she wrote. “How was a restricted item, a gas cylinder allowed onboard? Safety has to come first.”</p>

      <p>The fire, fanned by wind on the cruising train, quickly spread to two other compartments of the train catching most passengers off guard. The train driver, Muhammad Siddique, said the fire started at 6:18 in the morning.</p>
