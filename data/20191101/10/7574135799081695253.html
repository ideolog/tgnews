      <p>David Byrne posts monthly themed <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/david-byrne-champions-african-caribbean-music-w-beautiful-shitholes-playlist/">playlists</a> on his website and <a href="http://davidbyrne.com/radio/NaN">November’s</a> is “Indie Pop.” Here’s what he says:</p>
      <blockquote>I guess this is a short playlist of recent releases that might fall under the category – Indie Pop. Pop is intended to be catchy and accessible, and Indie as independent. Independent of what? Independent of conventional thinking, or how to achieve those aims? Or does it mean independent of the big 3 record labels….which overlaps with the first definition. if one thinks that the big 3 achieve dominance via muscle, and the indies have to use true skills.<br/><br/>Wooops, I just looked it up and I’m totally wrong- says it’s a subset of alternative rock.<br/><br/>Whatever, some really great songs here. Enjoy!</blockquote>
      <p>It is on the shorter side, and includes <b>Billie Eilish, Vagabon, Michael Kiwanuka, serpentwithfeet, Bon Iver, Brittany Howard, Kelsey Lu, Hobo Johnson</b> and more. There are also two songs by the mathy <b>black midi</b>, which don’t exactly fit with the rest of this otherwise smooth playlist, but who are we to tell David Byrne what to include? Also one of the black midi songs is titled “Talking Heads” so…listen over at <a href="http://davidbyrne.com/radio/NaN">David’s website</a>.</p>
