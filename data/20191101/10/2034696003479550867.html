      <p>Speaking about the film, Goldblum said: “Well, I guess those dinosaur movies are kind of scary. And we’re gonna do another one of those around these parts come this summer.”</p>
      <p>“[I’ll] be here shooting with Laura Dern and Sam Neill and Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard. Colin Trevorrow as the great director is going to be writing and directing it. And I can’t wait.”</p>
