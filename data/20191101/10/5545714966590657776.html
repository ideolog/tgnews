      <p>The Sega Ages range continues with its efforts to reintroduce classic Sega arcades to modern audiences. This week sees the return of side-scrolling action title <i>Shinobi</i>, now available to download on Nintendo Switch in Japan.<br/><br/>Released back in 1987, <i>Shinobi</i> is the tale of masterful young ninja Joe Musashi, who must rescue his kidnapped students from the evil clutches of terrorist organisation ZEED. Musashi must pick his way through five multi-stage missions, defeating heavily-armed militia with his martial arts skills and endless supply of shuriken. Today, <i>Shinobi</i> remains an excellent game and an extraordinary challenge, relying on quick reflexes and efficient negotiation of each missions multi-plane stages.</p>

      <p>This Sega Ages release features the original title in its arcade format, along with a boosted "Ages" edition which affords Musashi more damage and health. Also included are a "Rewind" feature, several display options, and support for HD Rumble. For the <i>Shinobi</i> elite, a new "Melee" button allows you to attempt each stage without the use of shurikens. I can't even imagine.<br/><br/>Sega Ages<i> Shinobi</i> is available to download on Nintendo Switch in Japan, priced at Â¥999.</p>
