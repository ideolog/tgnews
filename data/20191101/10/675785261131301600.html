      <h2>Cloud Climax, UK agent for AI-AITech, says that it’s adapting its ‘Emma’ sex robot, so she’s even more human-like</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T10:56:37+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 10:56</time> by <a rel="author">Shivali Best, https://www.facebook.com/shivalibestjournalist/</a></address>
      <p>While sex robots were once confined to science fiction, they’re now very much a reality - and they’re getting more and more lifelike.</p>
      <p>Now, one <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/sex-robots">sex robot</a> firm has claimed that it’s creating a sex robot that can ‘breathe’, as well as walk and talk.</p>
      <p>Cloud Climax, UK agent for AI-AITech, says that it’s adapting its ‘Emma’ sex robot, so she’s even more human-like.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-news/sex-robots-breathe-using-ai-20722897">Daily Star</a> , Cloud Climax manager Sam White explained: “Eventually Emma will be able to move her arms and have a chest cavity that ‘breathes’.</p>
      <p>“Further still, she will be able to use her legs and walk.”</p>

      <p>A less advanced version of Emma is currently on sale for the hefty price of £2,799.</p>
      <p>The current version is AI-capable, meaning it can hold a conversation with its owner, and even make facial expressions and blink.</p>
      <p>Mr White added: “Our dolls are already able to replace a physical human being for our customers and this can work on an emotional level as well as a physical one.</p>

      <p>“Emma is equipped with Artificial Intelligence. If you tell her you like something she will remember.</p>
      <p>“You can also tell her to remember something and she will remember it for you: 'Emma, it is my grandmother's birthday next Tuesday, please remind me to send her card on Monday’.”</p>
      <p>It remains unclear when AI-AITech plans to release the ‘breathing’ version of Emma, or how much it will cost.</p>
