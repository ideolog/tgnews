      <p>The initial "phase one" trade pact with China appears to be in good shape and is likely to be signed around mid-November, although a finite date is still in question, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Friday.</p>
      <p>WASHINGTON: The initial "phase one" trade pact with China appears to be in good shape and is likely to be signed around mid-November, although a finite date is still in question, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Friday.</p>
      <p>"We're pretty comfortable that the phase one is in good shape," he told Fox Business Network in an interview.</p>

      <p>U.S. President Donald Trump and other administration officials had looked toward the Nov. 11-17 Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit as a possible venue to sign the deal with Chinese President Xi Jinping before Chile this week canceled its plan to host the international summit.</p>
      <p>"Hopefully we can resurrect a date right in that range," Ross told the television network, adding that the question of a new location remained.</p>
      <p>Lead trade negotiators from both the United States and Chine are expected to speak by telephone on Friday as Ross prepared separately to travel to Asia for a three-day summit of Southeast Asian nations in Thailand.</p>
      <p>"There will some transactions announced - some very good-sized transactions - announced while I'm on this trip," he said, but gave no other details.</p>
