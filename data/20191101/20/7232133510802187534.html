      <p>Over the past few days, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/category/crypto/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> (BTC) has found itself in a lull. This is for good reason; after a 42% surge in under 24 hours, it makes sense for the cryptocurrency market to want to take a breather.</p>
      <p>Despite the fact that it makes sense for Bitcoin to see a period of calm and a slight retracement after a monumental surge higher, some analysts have flipped bearish, believe it or not.</p>
      <p>In fact, as <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/10/24/bitcoin-price-bottom-mid-november-6500-analysis/">reported by this outlet previously</a>, one trader expects for BTC to enter the high-$6,000s or low-$7,000s in the coming weeks. The idea here is that that region is where there exists a confluence of technical levels: the 0.5 Fibonacci Retracement of the $3,200 to $14,000 move, the bottom of a descending channel, amongst other important levels.</p>
      <p>But, with the candle for the month of October <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/10/31/bitcoin-monthly-candle-to-close-around-9300-bullish-or-bearish/">recently closing relatively strong</a> above $9,000, some say it is only a matter of time before the crypto market continues to mount higher, potentially to kickstart the second phase of this ongoing bull cycle.</p>

      <h3>Bulls Readying to Push Bitcoin Higher</h3>
      <p>Trader HornHairs has noted that he “likes the chance we hit $14,000 before $7,000.” But why, exactly, does the trader expect Bitcoin to surge higher by 55% from the current price of $9,200 over the alternative scenario of a collapse to $7,000.</p>
      <p>Well, it has much to do with where Bitcoin has just bounced from and where it closed October. He remarked in a recent tweet that with Bitcoin bouncing strong and holding above the one-month bullish breaker, the 0.618 Fibonacci Retracement of the entire cycle, the Point of Control as defined by the volume profile, and the yearly pivot, BTC is leaning rather bullish.</p>

      <h3>Fundamentals Support Crypto Growth</h3>
      <p>The fundamentals support the growth of Bitcoin.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, Jerome Powell, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, revealed that the Federal Open Market Committee has <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/10/30/federal-reserve-cuts-rates-by-0-25-bullish-for-bitcoin/">lowered its benchmark funds rate by 0.25%</a> (25 basis points) 5o a range of 1.5% to 1.75%. This is the Federal Reserve’s third cut this year.</p>
      <p>While expected, it is believed that dropping interest rates, which equate to liquidity injections into financial markets, benefit the largely “risk-on” Bitcoin, along with the U.S. market.<a href="https://video.foxbusiness.com/v/6066321285001/#sp=show-clips"> Speaking to Fox Business</a> earlier this year, known cryptocurrency analyst Tom Lee said the following on rate cuts:</p>
      <blockquote>“Bitcoin’s becoming increasingly a macrohedge for investors against things that could go wrong. Rate cuts are adding liquidity. Liquidity is pushing money into all these risk assets and also hedges, which is helping Bitcoin.”</blockquote>
      <p>Aside from fundamentals, we’ve seen the blockchain pass a key milestone. As <a href="https://twitter.com/yassineARK/status/1189559688494493697">pointed out by Yassine Elmandjra</a>, a crypto asset analyst at markets research/fund management firm ARK Invest, the Bitcoin network has now seen $1 billion worth of transaction fees paid. Cumulative fee revenue may not mean much in and of itself, so here’s a way to put it that may put this statistic into perspective:</p>
      <p>Tuur Demeester, the founding partner of Adamant Capital, framed this statistic best when he <a href="https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/1189567095975096326">wrote on Twitter </a>the other day that this effectively means that “$1B funding the world’s strongest firewall.</p>
