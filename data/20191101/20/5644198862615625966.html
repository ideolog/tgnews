      <p>SINGAPORE: Singapore will see more wet weather in the next two weeks, along with a few slightly hazy mornings, the Meteorological Service Singapore (MSS) said in a media advisory on Friday (Nov 1). </p>
      <p>There will be six to eight days of moderate to heavy afternoon thunderstorms in the first half of November, said MSS.</p>

      <p>On one or two days in the early part of the fortnight, a temporary shift in winds could result in the passage of Sumatra squalls over Singapore, bringing widespread thundery showers with gusty wind between the predawn and early morning. </p>
      <p>The daily temperature on most days is forecast to range between 24 degrees Celsius and 34 degrees Celsius. </p>
      <p>On some days, the daily maximum temperature could reach a high of around 35 degrees Celsius. </p>
      <p>The first two weeks of November could also see some slightly hazy mornings due to the "accumulation of particulate matter in the atmosphere under light wind conditions", said MSS. </p>
      <p>"Such slight haziness in the atmosphere usually improves in the latter part of the morning as the winds strengthen, which helps to disperse the pollutants," it added.</p>

        <b>RAINFALL DEFICIT CEASES IN OCTOBER</b>
      </p>
      <p>Most days last month saw thunderstorms, ending the rainfall deficit Singapore had been experiencing since July.</p>
      <p>A rainfall deficit situation refers to a period of at least three consecutive months with monthly rainfall more than 40 per cent below the climatological rainfall, averaged over the rainfall stations with long-term records across the island.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>October saw the second highest daily total rainfall for the month at a climate station since rainfall records began in 1869.</p>
      <p>This was on Oct 27, when the climate station in Changi recorded a daily total rainfall of 99.2mm following a heavy downpour over many parts of the island in the late afternoon and evening.</p>
      <p>It is second only to the 139.8mm daily total rainfall recorded at the climate station in October 2013.</p>
      <p>Last month also saw the second highest average maximum temperature for October, with the climate station at Changi registering 32.7 degrees Celsius as the average maximum temperature for the month.</p>
      <p>This is just shy of the October record high of 33 degrees Celsius set in 2002.</p>
      <p>The daily maximum temperature on several days climbed above 34 degrees Celsius and the highest daily maximum temperature recorded was 35.7 degrees Celsius on Oct 13 in Clementi.</p>
