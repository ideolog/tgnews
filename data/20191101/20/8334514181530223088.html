      <p>MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia’s Safmar group, an umbrella for Mikhail Gutseriyev’s family business, said in a statement on Friday that it plans to buy some assets that it said were previously owned by Gutseriyev’s nephew, Mikail Shishkhanov, from the state-controlled Trust bank.</p>
      <p>“This is not a question of paying off a mythical Mikhail Gutseriyev debt but of acquiring efficiently operating assets with a high market value,” said Safmar, where Gutseriyev chairs the board of directors.</p>
      <p>Reuters, citing a document prepared by Trust bank, reported on Thursday that Gutseriyev had offered to buy back a property company and other assets taken on by the state to partially cover the bailout of two banks - B&amp;N and Rost Bank - once owned by his family.</p>
      <p>Safmar, which had declined to comment prior to the Reuters report, said on Friday that Gutseriyev had not been a controlling shareholder with B&amp;N bank since 1995. It added that he had not been a shareholder with Rost Bank.</p>
      <p>Russia’s central bank bailed out both banks in 2017.</p>
      <p>Reuters could not independently confirm Safmar’s statement about the ownership structure of the banks.</p>
