      <p>ALISO VIEJO, Calif. (KABC) -- St. Mary's School in Aliso Viejo held a school assembly where students donated their locks of hair for this good cause.<br/><br/>The school charity event will help Children With Hair Loss, an organization that provides human hair replacement for children facing medically-related hair loss. This includes kids battling childhood cancer.<br/><br/>"All of the hair that's collected today, large boxes you see, will be going to the organization," said Sharon Taylor, head of St. Mary's School.<br/><br/>There were more than three dozen volunteers, including parents, teachers and kids, donating to help fight cancer.<br/><br/>"I donated 8 inches of hair because I have relatives who have passed away from cancer," said student Natalie Ng.<br/><br/>Taylor said there's always a look of surprise, nerves and excitement before their haircut.<br/><br/>Park's Salon provided their stylists and offered a free styling for all participants.<br/><br/>"I feel like a small act of kindness makes a difference in somebody else's life," said Olivia Bryant, another student.<br/><br/>"I donated my hair to help someone feel normal going through the cancer treatment process," said Kendall Dowd, a parent.<br/><br/>Over the last 10 years, St. Mary's School has donated anywhere between 4-5,000 inches of hair.<br/><br/>"It's important for me to know that little girls who probably don't have hair can have that feeling of having hair," said student Teagan Domain.<br/><br/>Overall, participants said the event was empowering and promoted giving back to those in need.<br/><br/>"It makes me feel incredibly empowered, and I hope that if I ever have to fight this battle, that someone would do the same for me," Dowd said.<br/><br/>For more information, visit <a href="https://childrenwithhairloss.us/">www.childrenwithhairloss.us</a>.</p>
