      <p>Skipper <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scott-brown">Scott Brown</a> is struggling to be fit for Celtic's <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/betfred-league-cup">Betfred Cup</a> semi-final against Hibernian at Hampden Park on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The midfielder went off with a thigh injury in the 2-0 home win over St Mirren on Wednesday night and is a doubt.</p>
      <p>He declared himself fit afterwards but <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> boss Neil Lennon revealed earlier on Friday the veteran could now miss the showdown against his former club.</p>
      <p>Striker Vakoun Bayo will see a specialist on Monday with regards a knee problem, Leigh Griffiths and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/mikey-johnston">Mikey Johnston</a> are back in training while Jozo Simunovic (knee) remains out alongside Daniel Arzani (knee) and Greg Taylor is cup-tied.</p>
      <p>Hibs, meanwhile, will assess winger Martin Boyle after he made his comeback off the bench from an ankle break in midweek.</p>
      <p>Boss Paul Heckingbottom also reported multiple knocks on unnamed players.</p>
