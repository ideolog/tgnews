      <h1>Permitless gun carry in Oklahoma takes effect</h1>

      <p>A "<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/state-and-local/legislation">constitutional carry</a>" gun law in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southwest/oklahoma">Oklahoma</a> took effect Friday. Also known as <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/personal-freedoms/second-amendment">permitless carry</a>, the law lets some Oklahomans carry a firearm in public without a license.</p>
      <p>Most Oklahomans 21 and older can now carry concealed or unconcealed firearms without having gone through a background check or training requirements, with exceptions for those illegally in the country or who have been convicted of certain crimes.</p>

      <p>Firearms are still prohibited in public buildings, bars, casinos and schools, and at professional sporting events.</p>

      <p>Oklahoma's Supreme Court and a county judge this week rejected Oklahoma City Democratic Rep. Jason Lowe's requests to hold off on the law.</p>
      <p>Lowe had introduced a petition in August following the mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio. The petition would have stopped the law from taking effect and made it a 2020 ballot question, had it been successful.</p>

      <p>The Oklahoma Second Amendment Association filed a protest against the petition that rendered its signatures invalid.</p>
      <p>Republican <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/state-and-local/governors">Gov. Kevin Stitt</a> signed the bill into law in February.</p>

      <p>“As I traveled all over the state to all 77 counties, I heard from Oklahomans all over that they wanted us to protect their right to bear arms,” Stitt said at the time.</p>

      <p>There are at least 16 states that have some version of a permitless carry law, according to the National Rifle Association (NRA).</p>
      <p>"Government exists for the people, not the other way around," said Jason Ouimet, the NRA's Institute for Legislative Action (ILA) executive director. "This law honors the right of law-abiding Oklahomans to defend themselves and their loved ones without begging for the government’s permission beforehand."</p>
