      <p><a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/TheCoolKids/profile">The Cool Kids</a> and Kenny Beats collaborating on a song makes total sense but for some reason, it seems completely unexpected. <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/chuck-inglish/profile">Chuck Inglish</a> and <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/sir-michael-rocks/profile">Sir Michael Rocks</a> link up with Kenny on the new single, "Dipped" which is undoubtedly a bop. Over some trippy trap music with evident influence from Chuck Inglish, Kenny Beats provides a muddy backdrop for Chuck Inglish and Sir Michael Rocks to vibe out to.</p>
      <p>“I remember hearing the Cool Kids for the first time; deleted all my beats and threw out all my clothes,” Kenny Beats said about his new collab with The Cool Kids “Bought a NCAA SnapBack and started pitching all my samples as low as I could. To call them friends and collaborators now in unreal to me.”</p>
      <p><u><b>Quotable Lyrics<br/></b></u>You can ask Chuck Norris, I don't know what the score is<br/>But I know we beat your ass, and she was pressin' me to smash<br/>Told you mama, I'mma pass, around the back through the legs<br/>Touch down do my dance, primetime Deion Sanders</p>
