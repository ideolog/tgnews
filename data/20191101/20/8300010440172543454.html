Grier then tells her daughter that they are all going to Disney World in Florida for a week and would be leaving the next day.<br/><br/>Grier told Storyful her daughter, who will be turning 8-years-old later this month, is a huge Disney fan and has been begging to be taken to Disney World for a year.<br/><br/>"All the while, I already had the trip booked but kept telling her, 'maybe one day.'"<br/><br/>The family decided to take the early birthday trip because Grier's husband will be deployed right before their daughter's actual birthday.<br/><br/><i>Disney is the parent company of ABC and this station.</i></p>
