      <p>MANCHESTER, United Kingdom: Manchester United's hopes of a fourth successive away win may hinge on in-form forward Marcus Rashford passing a fitness test after manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer revealed he had hurt his knee.</p>
      <p>Rashford, who injured his knee celebrating his stunning second goal in Wednesday's (Oct 30) 2-1 League Cup win over Chelsea, is one of three key players who face late fitness tests on the eve of the match with Bournemouth on Saturday.</p>

      <p>Rashford, who turned 22 on Thursday, is a doubt along with defenders Harry Maguire and Victor Lindelof, who picked up knocks late on in the Chelsea clash.</p>
      <p>"It's still early," said Solskjaer at his eve of match press conference.</p>
      <p>"Hopefully we can get them back on the pitch tomorrow (Saturday).</p>
      <p>"They had some treatment yesterday (Thursday) and they need a little more treatment today and a light session."</p>
      <p>Rashford has been a pivotal figure in United's upturn in fortunes.</p>
      <p>He has scored five goals in his last five games, with four for United and one for England in the 6-0 win over Bulgaria in the Euro 2020 qualifier last month.</p>
      <p>His goals have helped United to an unbeaten run of four matches, a win and a draw in the Premier League plus wins in the Europa League and League Cup.</p>
      <p>Rashford has been a different figure to the player who had managed one goal in his previous 12 games for club and country.</p>
      <p>Solskjaer has credited the return from injury of Anthony Martial who has served as an important support to Rashford in attack.</p>
      <p>"Since Anthony has come back, Marcus has flourished as well," said Solskjaer.</p>
      <p>"He is happier, facing goal, driving at people, taking players on instead of being that target man with his back to goal.</p>
      <p>"But Marcus wants to master all the skills in the end. But he has only just turned 22 so I am sure we will see him up front as a number nine.</p>
      <p>"It may be as a two with Anthony or as part of a three like we did at Norwich or out wide as we did at Chelsea.</p>
      <p>"There are different ways of playing with Marcus."</p>
      <p>After successive away wins at Partizan Belgrade in the Europa League, Norwich in the Premier League and then Chelsea, United hope to round off a run of four successive games on the road with another victory.</p>
      <p>The uptick in form has changed the mood around Old Trafford, and Solskjaer believes the 1-1 draw with rivals Liverpool two weeks ago - United are the only team to take points off the leaders thus far this term - marked a line in the sand.</p>
      <p>"The international break came at a great time for us," said the Norwegian.</p>
      <p>"We prepared for the Liverpool game and when you get a decent performance and result against the league leaders, it gives you a bit more energy.</p>
      <p>"From then on, the boys were happy with the work we did."</p>
