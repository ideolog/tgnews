      <p>DENVER (AP) — Roope Hintz scored twice, including a short-handed goal in the second period, and the Dallas Stars beat the Colorado Avalanche 2-1 on Friday night.</p>
      <p>It was Hintz’s second two-goal game of the season. The Stars have gone 5-1 since a dismal 1-7-1 start.</p>
      <p>Anton Khudobin turned back 38 shots, including one with a second remaining.</p>
      <p>Nathan MacKinnon scored a second-period goal to give him at least a point in all 13 games. It’s the longest stretch to begin a season since Henrik Zetterberg recorded a point in 17 straight for Detroit in 2007-08.</p>
      <p>Philipp Grubauer had 27 saves as Colorado finished 0-2-1 on its three-game homestand.</p>
      <p>Both teams take the ice again Saturday, with Colorado playing in Arizona and Dallas hosting Montreal.</p>
      <p>Advertising</p>
      <p>One of Khudobin’s top saves in the final period came when his right skate kept out a wrap-around try from J.T. Compher. The Stars clamped down over the final 1:35 after Colorado pulled Grubauer for an extra skater.</p>
      <p>Grubauer kept it a one-goal game midway through the third by stopping four rapid shots down low, including three back-hand attempts by Alexander Radulov.</p>
      <p>MacKinnon’s power-play goal in the second made it 2-1 and arrived moments after a wild sequence. The Avalanche thought they scored when Nazem Kadri dove to knock in a puck. Just before it went in, though, Compher and Andrew Cogliano collided to knock the net off its anchor. The official ruled it a goal, only to overturn the call on replay.</p>
      <p>Cogliano was sent to the penalty box for hooking and MacKinnon capitalized. He now has eight goals and 10 assists.</p>
      <p>The Stars jumped out a 2-0 lead as they carried over the momentum from a big comeback win. On Tuesday, they scored six straight goals in a 6-3 win over Minnesota.</p>
      <p>Hintz got his first goal of the game with 1:54 remaining in the first period when he gathered up his own rebound and lined it through the pads of Grubauer. His short-hander was early in the second and after the Avalanche made a sloppy line change.</p>

      <p>Colorado remains without captain Gabriel Landeskog (out indefinitely with a lower-body injury) and forward Mikko Rantanen (week-to-week with a lower-body ailment). Gone with those two are a combined eight goals and 11 assists.</p>
      <p>“It’s tough,” rookie defenseman Cale Makar said. “At the end of the day, we have so much depth. I don’t think anybody’s really worried.”</p>
      <p>NOTES: D Andrej Sekera missed a second straight game after slamming into the boards behind the net last weekend. … Avs D Ryan Graves replaced Mark Barberio in the lineup. … F Colin Wilson (lower body) was a scratch. … Kadri picked up assist No. 200 in his NHL career. … Broncos pass rusher Bradley Chubb, who’s recovering from a torn ACL, was in attendance.</p>
      <p>UPCOMING</p>
      <p>Stars: Host Montreal on Saturday and Colorado on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Avalanche: First of two road games Saturday in Arizona.</p>
