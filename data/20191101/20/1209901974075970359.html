      <p>This Fashion Friday celebrity stylist Kim XO Appelt takes us into the closet of YouTuber Sunny Lenarduzzi.</p>
      <p>Kim removes everything out of Sunny’s closet in order to find the simple basics that are easy to style.</p>
      <p>From belts to shoes, to bags, Appelt organizes everything into piles; the yes, the no and the maybe.</p>
      <p>While going through the closet, Sunny questions Kim on how to wear certain items that might end up in the yes pile.</p>
      <p>Kim lends her expertise to ensure Sunny keeps the items that she will get the most out of, from keeping returning trends to ditching clothes she hasn’t worn in more than a year.</p>
      <p>Watch the video below to find out more.</p>
