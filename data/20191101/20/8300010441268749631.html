      <p>The shut-offs come as several fires erupted in Southern California this week.<br/><br/><a href="https://abc7.com/air-quality-smoke-dust-advisories-in-effect-as-fires-burn-across-socal/5646948/">Click here to see the latest on the multiple fires burning across the region.</a><br/><br/>This is the second round of planned proactive outages for SoCal Edison. Earlier this month, the utility cut power to roughly 30,000 homes because of dangerous weather.<br/><br/>But despite those power shut-offs, the Saddle Ridge Fire erupted. Fire investigators have not determined a cause of the <a href="https://abc7.com/saddle-ridge-fire-began-under-transmission-tower-investigators-say/5619488/">Saddle Ridge Fire</a>, but say it began directly beneath a SoCal Edison transmission tower in Sylmar. More than 30 homes were damaged or destroyed in that fire.</p>
