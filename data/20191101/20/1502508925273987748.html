      <p>The different departments responsible for supervision and regulation of banks, non-banks and co-operative banks have been unified by the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/reserve-bank-of-india">Reserve Bank of India </a>(RBI) under the Department of Supervision and Department of Regulation, with effect from November 1.</p>
      <p>Earlier, financial sector supervision was undertaken through three separate departments — the Department of banking supervision, Department of non-banking supervision and Department of co-operative bank supervision. Similarly, the regulatory powers of the RBI over banks, NBFCs and cooperative banks were carried out through three separate departments — the Department of banking regulation, Department of non-banking regulation and Department of cooperative banking regulation.</p>
      <p>The RBI said this move will make supervisory and regulatory process more activity-based rather than being segmented purely based on the organisational structure of regulated entities. This will also enable more effective and consolidated supervision of financial conglomerates under RBI’s purview.</p>
      <p>According to the regulator, the restructuring will give categorised supervisory approach to all the RBI supervised entities linked to their size and complexity.</p>
