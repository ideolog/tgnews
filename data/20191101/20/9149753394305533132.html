      <h1>BioWare loses another Anthem lead</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T20:16:53+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 20:16</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/author/anchalk/" target="_blank">Andy Chalk</a></address>
      <p>Chad Robertson, BioWare's head of live service and point man on <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/anthem-review/">Anthem</a>, is leaving the company. In a two-part Twitter thread, Robertson said that Anthem and BioWare "are in good hands," and that fans "can expect great things ahead."</p>

      <p>Despite Robertson's upbeat words, his departure isn't likely to instill confidence in anyone still paying attention to Anthem. It comes less than three months after the loss of former Anthem lead producer Ben Irving, who <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/anthem-lead-producer-ben-irving-is-leaving-bioware/">left BioWare in August</a> for a job at a different studio. </p>
      <p>It also takes place in the midst of serious uncertainty about the future of Anthem: The long-delayed Cataclysm eventually began, but BioWare announced in August that the plan to evolve the game world through expansive "acts" had been dropped in favor of <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/anthem-will-get-seasonal-updates-rather-than-the-previously-announced-acts/">seasonal updates</a>. The end of the Cataclysm event wasn't particularly clean, either. When it was over, BioWare left some elements of the event online for people to play until the next seasonal event went live, which turned out to be a <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/anthem-has-launched-a-halloween-event-called-season-of-skulls/">Halloween event</a> that kicked off earlier this month.</p>
      <p>Robertson previously served as the head of technology and studio director at Bioware Austin. His other credits, listed on <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,55942/">MobyGames</a>, include Warhammer Online: Age of Reckoning (for Mythic, which was acquired by EA in 2006 and merged with BioWare in 2009), Star Wars: The Old Republic, Dragon Age: Inquisition – Jaws of Hakkon, and Mass Effect: Andromeda.</p>
