      <p>Amazon has the TCL Alto 7+ sound bar on a <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/best-cell-phone-deals">discount</a> of $30 right now. That brings this already affordable sound bar and wireless subwoofer down to just $149.</p>
      <p>This is perhaps the best inexpensive sound bar and wireless subwoofer that you can pick up for your entertainment center.</p>
      <p>The Alto 7+ is the most expensive of TCL's sound bars, and that's because it is a 2.1-channel sound bar and it also comes with a wireless subwoofer. Making it great for a larger room. And those that want a lot of bass in their sound system.</p>

      <p>The bass, as you'd expect from a wireless subwoofer, on this one is pretty intense. Get ready for some earth-shaking bass out of the Alto 7+. The mids and highs are pretty crisp and clear too, which is always a good thing here. So the sound is really good. Though, don't compare to this to something from Samsung or LG that costs about three times this, as it won't compete.</p>
      <p>Now speaking of the regular price, at $179, with a sound bar and wireless subwoofer, TCL did have to cut a few corners to hit that price. That means there is no Dolby Atmos here. That's not a big deal for most people. But if you did want Atmos, you'll have to look elsewhere â€“ it's usually on the sound bars that are over $500. There is also no Chromecast. You can still stream music from your phone, but you'll need to do it the old-fashioned way, over Bluetooth.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, this is a very easy to set up sound bar and wireless sub and definitely worth picking up if you're tired of how bad your TVs internal speakers sound in your home.</p>
