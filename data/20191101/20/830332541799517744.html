      <h1>Why people are Googling 'Rage Against the Machine' today</h1>
      <h2>Unverified account tweet cryptic message</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T20:10:22+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 20:10</time> by <a rel="author">Lauren M. Johnson and Ryan Prior, CNN</a></address>
      <p>(CNN) - The message was cryptic. Just <a href="https://twitter.com/RATM/status/1190310485930979329?s=20">a graphic </a>listing some dates:</p>
      <p>El Paso, TX: March 26, 2020</p>
      <p>Las Cruces, NM: March 28, 2020</p>
      <p>Phoenix, AZ: March 30, 2020</p>
      <p>Indio, CA: April 10, 2020</p>
      <p>Indio, CA: April 17, 2020</p>
      <p>That's enough to send fans of Rage Against The Machine in a tizzy with excitement. Could the band be reuniting?<br/><br/>The band hasn't played together since 2011. If these dates are true, that's a big deal because the band could be playing at Coachella.</p>
      <p>The band's longtime associate Wayne Kamemoto confirmed the news to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevebaltin/2019/11/01/confirmed-rage-against-the-machine-to-reunite-in-2020-headline-coachella/#3fe0120a12b1">Forbes</a>.</p>
      <p>The account that made the announcement is not verified, and CNN is independently trying to confirm the details.</p>
      <p>Formed in 1991, Rage Against The Machine exhilarated fans with politically revolutionary lyrics through the 1990s, including hits like "Killing in the Name" and "Bulls on Parade."</p>
      <p>Time magazine and Rolling Stone named the band's third studio album, "The Battle of Los Angeles," as the top album of 1999.</p>
      <p>However, things went south in 2000. Lead singer Zack de la Rocha left the band over internal differences.</p>
      <p>The other members of the band, guitarist Tom Morello, bassist Tim Commeford, and drummer Brad Wilk, formed a new band, Audioslave, with former Soundgarden lead singer Chris Cornell in 2001.</p>
      <p>Audioslave recorded three studio albums before Cornell moved into a solo music career in 2007. Cornell died in <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/05/18/entertainment/chris-cornell-dead/index.html">May 2017 of suicide by hanging</a>.</p>
      <p>Rage Against The Machine reunited in 2007 before dissolving again in 2011. Could this be the start of another round? Fans are waiting to see.</p>
