      <p>Texting, ‘sexting’ and healthy relationships are to be among topics police aim to tackle in upcoming presentations to Surrey students in Grades 5-10.</p>
      <p>The effort “to empower young women and girls to make positive choices” – dubbed Project Lavender – was launched last month by the Surrey RCMP.</p>
      <p>Its development included collaboration with female students from across the Surrey district, a news release states.</p>
      <p>Topics covered were identified by the young women and girls who participated in the consultation process, it adds.</p>
      <p>The one-hour presentations – which are to be showcased this weekend at the Mounties’ public safety fair, 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. at École Salish Secondary, 7272 184 St. – can also be adapted for community groups and organizations, particularly those who engage with youth, the release notes.</p>
      <p>Insp. Wendy Mehat said police are “excited to see the impact Project Lavender will have with youth, particularly because they played such an integral part in it’s development.”</p>
      <p>“It is about giving our youth the confidence to accept their challenges and strengths with compassion and resiliency so they can make positive life choices.”</p>
