      <p>The car's owners on Nottingham Way reported that the car was stolen Thursday morning. Police said the thief got into the unlocked car, which was parked in the residents' driveway, and used the garage door opener to enter their house. </p>
      <p>The report said the thief also stole a wallet and car keys in addition to the car.</p>
      <p>Officers found the car Friday afternoon on John Nolen Drive after the driver fled the scene in it at Hy-Vee.  The car was later spotted on East Washington Avenue. Police tried to stop the car but did not chase it. The car was found crashed at Atwood Avenue and Dunning Street. </p>
      <p>Witnesses said four teen boys exited the car and ran away on foot. Madison police and a K-9 were able to chase and apprehend three of the boys. </p>
