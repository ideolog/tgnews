      <h1>Liverpool squad confirmed for Aston Villa trip as Jurgen Klopp faces midfield dilemma</h1>
      <h2>Jurgen Klopp's men take on Aston Villa in the Midlands on Saturday, looking to remain top of the table</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T20:47:48+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 20:47</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Richards, https://www.facebook.com/AARichards/</a></address>
      <p>Jurgen Klopp has decisions to make when Liverpool face Aston Villa in the Premier League on Saturday - not least whether to risk Fabinho in midfield.</p>
      <p>The Brazilian is one booking away from a suspension, and if he sees yellow against the Villans will miss the top of the table showdown with champions Manchester City next weekend.</p>
      <p>Asked how he would deal with his problem, Klopp joked on Friday: "No challenges at all.</p>
      <p>"[But] It's not possible against Aston Villa, playing without challenges in that position. You cannot ask for this. Player knows it, I know it."</p>
      <p>As such, he must decide whether to keep the Monaco man at the base of midfield, or drop captain Jordan Henderson into the deeper role.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> will decide late over whether Naby Keita is fit to play, having been substituted in midweek due to injury.</p>
      <p>The Reds remain without long-term absentee Nathaniel Clyne and Xherdan Shaqiri, who continues to have a calf problem.</p>
      <p>Joel Matip is out for "a few weeks" with a knee issue and young defender Ki-Jana Hoever is at the Under-17 World Cup also.</p>
      <p>For Villa, Dean Smith is expected to recall Jack Grealish to his starting lineup, after the captain missed the midweek Carabao Cup win over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> .</p>
      <p>Grealish suffered a calf injury at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> last weekend but Smith admitted: “Jack is OK, he’s pushing to be fit for Saturday. He’s responded really well to treatment.</p>
      <p>“He’s getting there. I am very, very hopeful that he will be fit for the weekend.”</p>
