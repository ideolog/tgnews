      <p>Chevron Corp reported a 36per cent drop in third-quarter profit on Friday as the oil major was hit by lower oil and gas prices due to record shale oil output in North America and a slowing global economy.</p>
      <p>REUTERS: Chevron Corp reported a 36per cent drop in third-quarter profit on Friday as the oil major was hit by lower oil and gas prices due to record shale oil output in North America and a slowing global economy.</p>
      <p>Net income attributable to the company fell to US$2.58 billion, or US$1.36 per share, in the three months ended Sept. 30, from US$4.05 billion, or US$2.11 per share a year earlier.</p>
