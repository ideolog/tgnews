      <h1>Hong Kong Protests Are Growing Outside of Blizzcon</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-01T20:13:04+00:00">01 Nov 2019, 20:13</time> by <a rel="author">Nathan Grayson</a></address>
      <p>This year’s Blizzcon in the US city of Anaheim, California has only just begun, but already, a crowd of more than 30 protesters has gathered outside the convention centre to show support for Hong Kong in the wake of Blizzard’s recent suspension of <i>Hearthstone</i> pro Chung “Blitzchung” Ng Wai.</p>
      <p>Protesters, some in cosplay, are holding signs and chanting slogans like “people over profit” and “free Hong Kong.”</p>
      <p>This particular protest has been facilitated by a group called Freedom Hong Kong, but <a href="https://www.kotaku.co.uk/2019/10/12/protests-are-coming-to-blizzcon-in-the-wake-of-blizzards-hong-kong-fiasco">multiple additional protests</a> – one organised by an activist group called Fight For The Future and another by the Protest Blizzcon subreddit – are expected to take place throughout the day.</p>
