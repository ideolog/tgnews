      <p>VERONA, Wis. - Verona Area High School staff and security broke up a fight between students Friday morning. </p>
      <p>According to a statement sent to families, the fight happened at 8:25 a.m. and involved four students. Four to six others who were friends with the students had engaged verbally. The school's security and a number of staff members immediately responded and separated the students. </p>
      <p>No injuries were reported, and no other students were said to have been in danger. </p>
      <p>Due to the school's policy for admitting visitors, the main entrance was closely monitored after the fight, as some students were asked to go through other entrances. </p>
      <p>The students who were in the fight both physically and verbally met with school staff. Their parents were contacted, and the students were sent home. </p>
      <p>The parents and guardians of the students involved in the fight were not allowed to enter the building. They were instead asked to meet with their children off school property.</p>
      <p>An investigation into the fight is ongoing, and the school said the students "will receive the appropriate consequences."</p>
