        <b>All 39 people found dead in a refrigerated lorry in Essex were Vietnamese, police have said.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The victims were found in a container on an industrial estate last week and were initially thought to be Chinese.</p>
      <p>But Essex Police said it was now in "direct contact with a number of families in Vietnam and the UK" and the Vietnamese government.</p>
      <p>A number of Vietnamese families have previously come forward fearing their loved ones are among the dead.</p>
      <p>Pham Thi Tra My, 26, sent her family a message on the night of 22 October - the day before the 39 people were found dead - saying her "trip to a foreign land has failed".</p>
      <p>Post-mortem examinations are being carried out on the 31 men and eight women to establish the cause of death.</p>
      <p>Assistant Chief Constable Tim Smith said: "At this time, we believe the victims are Vietnamese nationals, and we are in contact with the Vietnamese Government."</p>
      <p>He said police were not in a position to identify any of the victims.</p>

      <p>The Vietnamese Embassy in London said it was "deeply saddened" and sent its "heartfelt condolences" to the families of the victims.</p>
      <p>"Specific identities of the victims still need to be identified and confirmed by the relevant authorities of Vietnam and UK," it said.</p>
      <p>It said it would "closely co-ordinate with the relevant authorities of Vietnam and UK to support the families of the Vietnamese victims, if any, to bring their loved ones home".</p>

      <p>The father of 30-year-old Le Van Ha, who comes from an agricultural part of Vietnam, previously told the BBC he was convinced his son was among the dead.</p>
      <p>VietHome, a popular Vietnamese community forum in the UK, said it had passed on the pictures of almost 20 people who have been reported missing to detectives.</p>
      <p>Earlier, police in Vietnam's Ha Tinh province said they had charged two unnamed people with "organising or brokering illegal immigration".</p>
