      <p><b>ARCADIA, Calif.Â (AP)</b> - Fans are streaming into Santa Anita for opening day of the Breeders' Cup.</p>
      <p>A handful of protesters urging the end of horse racing in California toted signs outside one of the track's gates, but they were outnumbered by a larger group of racing industry workers carrying signs supporting horses and their livelihood at a nearby gate.</p>
      <p>Santa Anita has been the site of 36 horse deaths since December.</p>
      <p>Bettors waited in lines under blue skies and temperatures in the upper 70s with no sign of smoke from wildfires that have plagued Southern California in recent days.</p>
      <p>There are five Breeders' Cup races on Friday, highlighted by the $2 million Juvenile.</p>
      <p>Another nine races will be run Saturday.</p>
